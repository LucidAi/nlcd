require constant attention and wake up multiple times a night demanding milkies and they make you talk like a twoyearold when in fact youre pushing thirtyone frankly its exhausting by virtue of those factors alone babies should be extinct by now but the amazing thing is that they arent and i think this is because they make up for all of it by sheer awesomeness a redonkulous amount of awesomeness hat tip to himyms latest episode if i might add 1 baby skin have you felt the powdery soft skin of a baby who just woke up from a nap that coupled with the intoxicating fragrance of eau de bébé can send your ovaries straight into overdrive notice i didnt say my ovaries these ovaries need a break yall but yours can carry on 2 they poop rainbows no like literally like that one time finn ate crayons there was actual traces of color in his poop it was still really gross but in a colorful sort of way i guess 3 babies dont judge they dont care if i havent washed my hair in 3 days or cant fit into my size 28 super skinnies they dont care if my singing sounds like when the neighbors cat was attacked by what i imagine was another more angry cat they dont make jokes about my cellulite they look at me at see all the awesome parts that i often dont even see myself 4 baby babble watching them try so hard to form words only to have them come out sounding like bleh eh dehh is a special level of cute every time finn tries to talk its like he really concentrates before forming sounds and when he actually hears the babbling thats coming out of his mouth he stops and looks puzzled like as if that wasnt meant to happen and he tries again until he babytalks himself into a frenzy i half expect him to hulk smash some toys at the end of it 5 babies do what you tell them to do more or less unless they dont want to then they will scream bloody murder okay you know what scratch this point 5 redux babies are so stinkin cute to look at why are their heads so disproportionately big why do they look like emoticons why dont they ever have a bad hair day why are their thighs so deliciously chubby and most of all how can anything have this much cuteness crammed into such a tiny body april 18 2013 by daphne 6 comments giveaways reviews ads ive had the most massive backaches for a really long time now i dont know if its caused by the 9 months of pregnancy x 3 or the 30 hours of labor or 5 years of carrying the kids but one things for sure – my back these days is like a giant knot made up of a hundred smaller knots honestly neck and shoulder aches have been my constant companion for so long that i cant remember a time when my back didnt hurt even after i go for the best massages from those deadly chinese sinsehs the relief lasts for at most a day before the aches come right back again total bummer which is why last week when the osim folks asked me if i wanted to give the new uangel massage chair a spin i was really quite enthusiastic about it in fact i might have immediately fantasized about vegetating on my shiny new toy and having all the tension slowly massaged out of my knotted muscles multiple times a day and then some on monday i got a special delivery and squeeeeal i am in love okay you guys know i hardly ever squeal right im not much of the squealing sort but if theres anything that deserves some proper squealing this is it let me get straight to the point – first of all the massages when i sat down on the plush leather for my first massage the english language failed me so i looked at the husband and said wah sehshiokness which is perhaps the best way to describe the enjoyment i derive from the intense squeeze and knead massaging it comes with 5 different modes for me to customize the intensity and massaging motions for my neck shoulders back and legs this is now the special boss chair i head to the moment i wake up before i go to bed after lunch in the afternoonyou get the idea the other great thing about the uangel is that while it comes with the features of a fullsized massage chair it also has the ability to transform into a stylish compact little sofa how compact you ask to be precise it measures only 70cm width by 86cm depth in sofa mode which makes it an excellent spacesaving option for homes that dont have the luxury of space to fit a ginormous massage chair when you need a massage just touch a button and it transforms into a massage recliner and when you dont it transforms right back with another touch of a button as an added bonus the shiny upholstery is easy to clean and even the kids love it because its the perfect size for their cosy reading corner one more thing osim is one of the sponsors for this years cold storage kids run which will be held on 19 may the kids had a great time at last years run and theyre really excited to take part in the run this year who knows we might even trade run partners more on that soon from now to 19 april osim is having a dress up as angel facebook photo contest to participate just snap a photo of you as an angel and submit via the osim singapore facebook page april 16 2013 by daphne 3 comments breastfeeding ive been thinking that maybe its finally time to wean baby finn as in stopping breastfeeding and switching him to formula when he was born i didnt think id be successful at latching him on but just like that ive been doing it for almost 8 months now 8 months of powering through the depression 8 months of having my boob chewed on every 34 hours 8 months of special bonding time with my littlest one hes been adjusting to solids fairly well recently and im thinking that the time has come to give my boobs and the rest of me a break letting someone else babe im looking at you take over the feeding for a change so i can maybe sleep through the night for once oh sweet uninterrupted nighttime sleep you and me be needing a date real soon with kirsten i made it to 9 months of breastfeeding and the day i decided to wean her i popped the champagne and did a victory dance but that was because i never managed to latch her on and the whole pumping experience made me feel like bessie the cow i couldnt wait to be done with all the tubes and pumping equipment this time around with finn im really torn about it i still had to struggle with dmer these past 8 months but being able to hold him in my arms while he drank was a really special experience and i feel like im not quite ready to give it up just yet and then theres his refusal to drink from the bottle to contend with ive tried 4 different brands of bottles and he hates every single one of them i tried expressed breast milk even fresh ones right from the boob and several brands of formula but none of them worked when i have to leave him with my inlaws for an afternoon hell struggle through each feed and wait for me to appear before attacking my boobs like hes positively starving so i made a list of pros and cons like i usually do when faced with dilemmas you guys have any advice on somewhat painless weaning techniques see you in the comments april 15 2013 by daphne 21 comments lil lookbook shirt bangkoks chatuchak market jeans kutie protocol shoes pediped tie river island specs on loan from daddy april 12 2013 by daphne 0 comment seriously somewhat serious as parents whether were aware of it or not comparing is something we do quite a lot we compare parenting styles our kids developmental progress the coolest baby gear the places we visit the amount of fun were having with our kids which in itself is not a bad thing until it messes with our heads and makes us less happy with what we have somewhere someones kid is smarter cuter and better behaved than ours theyre wheeling their tots around in the aston martin silver cross pram theyre traveling to norway so their kid can take a photo of the aurora borealis theyre doing all the stuff we didnt think we wanted to do until they did it and suddenly were like good heavens my life wouldnt be complete without that and then we look at our lives and feel like what we have is about as awesome as a partially blind ferret whos also missing several toes being happy with what we have is a learned response it doesnt require having the best stuff or even more stuff for that matter weve got what weve got and sure we can and should try to do better but for now all we need to do is look at what we have and just be happy this this is my happy april 11 2013 by daphne 9 comments finn baby finn hasnt quite mastered the art of speaking yet but hes not letting a little thing like his lack of linguistic ability stop him from making his feelings clear to us seriously for a little guy hes sure got a lot of expressions here are some of my favorites april 10 2013 by daphne 0 comment milestones musings guess what yall weve finally caved and hired ourselves a livein domestic helper shocking i know all this while weve never been hot on the idea of having a stranger live in the house with us and besides we were convinced that we wanted to do everything for the kids on our own so we managed to somehow survive the past 5 years and 3 kids without a maid the laundry wasnt always done on time and the house wasnt as spotless as i would have likedokay who am i kidding most days it felt like we were living in a war zone where little kids were doing the fighting with a formidable arsenal of toys over the past 7 months with a new baby at home and more projects at work the time has finally come for us to reconsider that decision initially we got a parttime cleaner to come in once a week for a couple of months but it wasnt quite enough so after a lot of thought it made more sense to get someone in full time also it might be a direct result of too much downton abbey so last thursday we picked up our domestic helper and so far its been working out really well i still want to do the baby stuff like the feeding and bathing as much as possible but its nice to be able to outsource the cooking and chores to someone else seriously my house hasnt been this clean since like ever and its nice to have an extra pair of hands to help out with stuff here and there so we dont have to work till 2am every night obviously weve all had to make some adjustments the helper included and itll probably take some time to get used to one another but the important thing is that she seems to like the kids and they like her back they were a little shy at first like when they wanted an apple and i was busy feeding finn i overheard them whispering to each other you go and ask aunty no you go okay scissors paper stone and finally tru went up to her and asked aunty can you cut an apple for us pleaseeeee now they realize that with another adult in the house they dont need to wait for me to finish feeding finn to attend to them so theyve warmed up to her nicely hopefully this arrangement works out i do so enjoy being the dowager countess of grantham around here april 8 2013 by daphne 20

They cry for no reason, make poopie in their pants, require constant attention and wake up multiple times a night demanding milkies. And they make you talk like a two-year-old when in fact, you’re pushing thirty-one. Frankly, it’s exhausting. By virtue of those factors alone, babies should be extinct by now but the amazing thing is that they aren’t. And I think this is because they make up for all of it by sheer awesomeness. A redonkulous amount of awesomeness (hat tip to HIMYM’s latest episode), if I might add. 1. Baby skin. Have you felt the powdery soft skin of a baby who just woke up from a nap? That coupled with the intoxicating fragrance of eau de bébé can send your ovaries straight into overdrive. Notice I didn’t say MY ovaries. These ovaries need a break, y’all but yours can carry on. 2. They poop rainbows. No, like literally. Like that one time Finn ate crayons, there was actual traces of color in his poop. It was still really gross but in a colorful sort of way, I guess. 3. Babies don’t judge. They don’t care if I haven’t washed my hair in 3 days or can’t fit into my size 28 super skinnies. They don’t care if my singing sounds like when the neighbor’s cat was attacked by what I imagine was another more angry cat. They don’t make jokes about my cellulite.

Unless they don’t want to, then they will scream bloody murder. Okay you know what, scratch this point. 5 (redux). Babies are so stinkin’ cute to look at. Why are their heads so disproportionately big? Why do they look like emoticons? Why don’t they ever have a bad hair day? Why are their thighs so deliciously chubby? And most of all, how can anything have this much cuteness crammed into such a tiny body?\n\ngiveaways reviews ads Relaxing one corner with my Osim uAngel I’ve had the most massive backaches for a really long time now. I don’t know if it’s caused by the 9 months of pregnancy (x 3) or the 30 hours of labor or 5 years of carrying the kids but one thing’s for sure – my back these days is like a giant knot made up of a hundred smaller knots. Honestly, neck and shoulder aches have been my constant companion for so long that I can’t remember a time when my back didn’t hurt. Even after I go for the best massages from those deadly Chinese sinsehs, the relief lasts for at most a day before the aches come right back again. Total bummer. Which is why last week, when the OSIM folks asked me if I wanted to give the new uAngel massage chair a spin, I was really quite enthusiastic about it. In fact, I might have immediately fantasized about vegetating on my shiny new toy and having all the tension slowly massaged out of my knotted muscles multiple times a day. And then some. On Monday, I got a special delivery and  *squeeeeal* I AM IN LOVE. Okay, you guys know I hardly ever squeal right? I’m not much of the squealing sort but if there’s anything that deserves some proper squealing, this is it. Let me get straight to the point – first of all, the massages. When I sat down on the plush leather for my first massage, the English language failed me so I looked at the husband and said “WAH SEH…SHIOKNESS.” Which is perhaps the best way to describe the enjoyment I derive from the intense squeeze and knead massaging. It comes with 5 different modes for me to customize the intensity and massaging motions for my neck, shoulders, back, and legs. This is now the special boss chair I head to the moment I wake up, before I go to bed, after lunch, in the afternoon…you get the idea. The other great thing about the uAngel is that while it comes with the features of a full-sized massage chair, it also has the ability to transform into a stylish compact little sofa. How compact, you ask? To be precise, it measures only 70cm (width) by 86cm (depth) in sofa mode, which makes it an excellent space-saving option for homes that don’t have the luxury of space to fit a ginormous massage chair.

Who knows, we might even trade run partners. More on that soon! *From now to 19 April, OSIM is having a Dress Up as Angel Facebook Photo Contest!

As in stopping breastfeeding and switching him to formula. When he was born, I didn’t think I’d be successful at latching him on but just like that, I’ve been doing it for almost 8 months now. 8 months of powering through the depression. 8 months of having my boob chewed on every 3-4 hours. 8 months of special bonding time with my littlest one. He’s been adjusting to solids fairly well recently and I’m thinking that the time has come to give my boobs (and the rest of me) a break. Letting someone else (babe, I’m looking at you) take over the feeding for a change so I can maybe sleep through the night for once. Oh, sweet, uninterrupted nighttime sleep, you and me be needing a date real soon. With Kirsten, I made it to 9 months of breastfeeding and the day I decided to wean her, I popped the champagne and did a victory dance. But that was because I never managed to latch her on and the whole pumping experience made me feel like Bessie the cow. I couldn’t wait to be done with all the tubes and pumping equipment. This time around with Finn, I’m really torn about it. I still had to struggle with D-MER these past 8 months but being able to hold him in my arms while he drank was a really special experience and I feel like I’m not quite ready to give it up just yet. And then there’s his refusal to drink from the bottle to contend with. I’ve tried 4 different brands of bottles and he hates every single one of them.

When I have to leave him with my in-laws for an afternoon, he’ll struggle through each feed and wait for me to appear before attacking my boobs like he’s positively starving. So I made a list of pros and cons like I usually do when faced with dilemmas. You guys have any advice on somewhat painless weaning techniques? See you in the comments.\n\nseriously somewhat serious This is my happy As parents, whether we’re aware of it or not, comparing is something we do quite a lot. We compare parenting styles, our kids’ developmental progress, the coolest baby gear, the places we visit, the amount of fun we’re having with our kids. Which in itself is not a bad thing, until it messes with our heads and makes us less happy with what we have. Somewhere, someone’s kid is smarter, cuter and better behaved than ours. They’re wheeling their tots around in the Aston Martin Silver Cross pram. They’re traveling to Norway so their kid can take a photo of the Aurora Borealis. They’re doing all the stuff we didn’t think we wanted to do until they did it and suddenly, we’re like “GOOD HEAVENS MY LIFE WOULDN’T BE COMPLETE WITHOUT THAT.” And then we look at our lives and feel like what we have is about as awesome as a partially blind ferret who’s also missing several toes. Being happy with what we have is a learned response. It doesn’t require having the best stuff or even more stuff for that matter. We’ve got what we’ve got and sure, we can (and should) try to do better. But for now, all we need to do is look at what we have and just be happy.\n\nmilestones & musings We’re going Downton Guess what, y’all? We’ve finally caved and hired ourselves a live-in domestic helper. SHOCKING, I know. All this while, we’ve never been hot on the idea of having a stranger live in the house with us and besides, we were convinced that we wanted to do everything for the kids on our own so we managed to somehow survive the past 5 years and 3 kids without a maid. The laundry wasn’t always done on time and the house wasn’t as spotless as I would have liked…okay, who am I kidding? Most days, it felt like we were living in a war zone where little kids were doing the fighting with a formidable arsenal of toys. Over the past 7 months, with a new baby at home and more projects at work, the time has finally come for us to reconsider that decision. Initially, we got a part-time cleaner to come in once a week for a couple of months, but it wasn’t quite enough so after a lot of thought, it made more sense to get someone in full time. Also, it might be a direct result of too much Downton Abbey. So last Thursday, we picked up our domestic helper and so far, it’s been working out really well. I still want to do the baby stuff like the feeding and bathing as much as possible but it’s nice to be able to outsource the cooking and chores to someone else. Seriously, my house hasn’t been this clean since like ever and it’s nice to have an extra pair of hands to help out with stuff here and there so we don’t have to work till 2am every night. Obviously, we’ve all had to make some adjustments (the helper included) and it’ll probably take some time to get used to one another but the important thing is that she seems to like the kids, and they like her back. They were a little shy at first , like when they wanted an apple and I was busy feeding Finn, I overheard them whispering to each other “you go and ask aunty”, “no, you go”, “okay, scissors paper stone…” and finally Tru went up to her and asked “Aunty, can you cut an apple for us pleaseeeee?” Now they realize that with another adult in the house, they don’t need to wait for me to finish feeding Finn to attend to them so they’ve warmed up to her nicely. Hopefully this arrangement works out. I do so enjoy being the Dowager Countess of Grantham around here.",

outbreaks the findings published this month in the peerreviewed bmc veterinary research journal bring increased scrutiny on the feed industry in the fight against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus or pedv the fastmoving virus has killed an estimated 8 million piglets since it was first identified in the united states last year pushing us pork prices to record highs christopher doering reported last week at the des moines register online that the study published in the peerreviewed bmc veterinary research journal collected feed residue at three farms one in northwest iowa and two in southwest minnesota where the pedv was found from there an experiment was conducted at south dakota state university where five piglets were given the infected feed all became sick another group of animals given a placebo were not infected with the virus the study did not look into how the feed became infected with the pedv we did the study and that was for one reason and that reason was not to incriminate the feed industry the reason was to understand the risk so if its a real risk then we can try to protect our farms said scott dee director of research for pipestone veterinary clinic in

of wet weather have fueled expectations for a corn crop so large that mounds of the grain will be a common sight across the midwest after the harvest which starts next month the journal writers

bushel on friday on the chicago board of trade contracts for december delivery after the harvest settled 07 higher at 37625 a bushel the steep price declines have kindled hopes among some producers that bargainseeking buyers could ratchet up purchases but a close look at key consumers of corn suggests significant constraints to how much demand could pick up even with the grain so cheap a decline

the usgs report says the scientists noted that higher stream flow in the dakotas had occurred even as water use increased in addition they said lower stream flow in some areas could be related in part to groundwater pumping in the great plains average air temperatures have warmed 3 to 4 degrees in the last century according to the environmental protection agency that contributes to the problem also oklahoma state university agricultural economist jayson lusk indicated in a column on the editorial pages of todays wall street journal cheeseburgers wont melt the polar ice caps that the environmental protection agency estimates that us agriculture including livestock production accounts for only about 8 of total greenhousegas emissions in the country livestock in the us have lower greenhousegas footprints than in other parts of the world this is partly because american producers generally use higherquality feeds higheryielding breeds and more productivityenhancing technologies

            "url": "http://agfax.com/2014/08/18/keith-good-livestock-feed-can-carry-deadly-ped-virus-study-finds/", 
            "text": "Livestock\n\nReuters writer Tom Polansek reported last week that, “A research study has shown for the first time that livestock feed can carry a virus that has killed about 13 percent of the U.S. hog herd, the study’s lead author said, confirming suspicions among farmers and veterinarians battling outbreaks.\n\n“The findings, published this month in the peer-reviewed BMC Veterinary Research journal, bring increased scrutiny on the feed industry in the fight against Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus, or PEDv.\n\n“The fast-moving virus has killed an estimated 8 million piglets since it was first identified in the United States last year, pushing U.S. pork prices to record highs.”\n\nChristopher Doering reported last week at The Des Moines Register Online that, “The study, published in the peer-reviewed BMC Veterinary Research journal, collected feed residue at three farms, one in northwest Iowa and two in southwest Minnesota, where the PEDv was found. From there, an experiment was conducted at South Dakota State University where five piglets were given the infected feed; all became sick. Another group of animals given a placebo were not infected with the virus. The study did not look into how the feed became infected with the PEDv.\n\n“‘We did the study and that was for one reason, and that reason was not to incriminate the feed industry, the reason was to understand the risk so if it’s a real risk then we can try to protect our farms,’ said Scott Dee, director of research for Pipestone Veterinary Clinic in Minnesota, who was the lead author on the study. ‘Feed has always been thought of as a risk factor but no one had ever proven it before’” [see related Wall Street Journal article by Jesse Newman and Kelsey Gee from this March, \"Feed Is Suspect in Spread of Deadly Pig Virus.\"]\n\nCrop Watch\n\nTony C. Dreibus and Jesse Newman reported in today’s Wall Street Journal that, “‘We’re going to drown in corn this year.’\n\n“The assessment, from Jeff Brown, 45 years old, a fifth-generation farmer outside Decatur, Ill., sums up the view of most people who grow, trade or process corn as they brace for another record U.S. harvest.\n\n“Months of wet weather have fueled expectations for a corn crop so large that mounds of the grain will be a common sight across the Midwest after the harvest, which starts next month.”\n\nThe Journal writers explained that, “Expectations of a glut have driven corn prices down by 13% this year, to near four-year lows, after a 40% decrease last year. September futures, the front-month contract, rose 1% to $3.6575 a bushel on Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Contracts for December delivery, after the harvest, settled 0.7% higher at $3.7625 a bushel.\n\n“The steep price declines have kindled hopes among some producers that bargain-seeking buyers could ratchet up purchases. But a close look at key consumers of corn suggests significant constraints to how much demand could pick up, even with the grain so cheap.\n\n“A decline in livestock herds means there are fewer animals in the U.S. to feed, and U.S. demand for ethanol–a corn-based additive to gasoline–is pushing a government-set cap. Corn exports, meanwhile, are suffering from a plunge in purchases by China [related graph].”\n\nKatie Micik reported on Friday at DTN (link requires subscription) that, “Prevented planting acreage declined significantly from last year and is largely concentrated in North Dakota and Minnesota, according to Farm Services Agency’s initial release of certified acreage data.\n\n“Farmers were prevented from planting 1.54 million acres of corn, down from 2013′s total of 3.16 million acres.\n\n“On soybeans, 827,131 acres went unplanted, compared to 1.7 million acres last year.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas recently released its Agricultural Survey for the second quarter of 2014, which stated in part that, “District dryland values continued rising in the second quarter, but irrigated cropland and ranchland values were slightly lower. However, farmland values for all land types were above year-ago levels. Dryland values increased almost 6 percent over last year, while irrigated cropland and ranchland were up about 5 percent compared with last year.\n\n“Farmland values are anticipated to continue trending up next quarter. This survey period, no respondents reported anticipating a decreasing trend. Credit standards continued to tighten this quarter, although the vast majority of respondents noted no change in standards [related graph].”\n\n(A recap of other recent Federal Reserve Ag reports for the second quarter can be found here, while a summary of Fed reports from the first quarter of this year can be found in this FarmPolicy.com update from May).\n\nWeather Matters\n\nWith respect to climate and weather issues, Joby Warrick reported on the front page of today’s Washington Post that, “When the winter rains failed to arrive in this Sacramento Valley town for the third straight year, farmers tightened their belts and looked to the reservoirs in the nearby hills to keep them in water through the growing season.\n\n“When those faltered, some switched on their well pumps, drawing up thousands of gallons from underground aquifers to prevent their walnut trees and alfalfa crops from drying up. Until the wells, too, began to fail.\n\n“Now, across California’s vital agricultural belt, nervousness over the state’s epic drought has given way to alarm. Streams and lakes have long since shriveled up in many parts of the state, and now the aquifers — always a backup source during the region’s periodic droughts — are being pumped away at rates that scientists say are both historic and unsustainable.”\n\nThe Post article noted that, “It was never supposed to get this bad. For decades, the Central Valley’s farmers relied on their own form of drought-proofing: a vast network of reservoirs and irrigation canals built over years to capture annual snow melt from the Sierra Nevada mountains. And to recoup the costs of expensive irrigation systems, they switched to more profitable crops such as almonds, walnuts and rice, which require still more water.”\n\nMaya Srikrishnan reported in yesterday’s Los Angeles Times that, “Montana farmer Rocky Norby has worked the land along the Missouri River for more than 20 years, coaxing sugar beets and malted barley out of the arid ground.\n\n“‘Every year it gets worse,’ he said. ‘There’s not enough water to get through our pumps.’ Last month, he said, he spent more than $10,000 trying to remove the sand from his clogged irrigation system.\n\n“The Missouri River’s stream flow has changed significantly over the last 50 years, leading to serious water shortages in Montana and Wyoming and flooding in the Dakotas, according to a U.S. Geological Survey report released last month.”\n\nYesterday’s article added that, “Climate shifts may be causing the disparate changes in the Missouri River Basin, the USGS report says. The scientists noted that higher stream flow in the Dakotas had occurred even as water use increased. In addition, they said, lower stream flow in some areas could be related in part to groundwater pumping… In the Great Plains, average air temperatures have warmed 3 to 4 degrees in the last century, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That contributes to the problem.”\n\nAlso, Oklahoma State University agricultural economist Jayson Lusk indicated in a column on the editorial pages of today’s Wall Street Journal (“Cheeseburgers Won’t Melt the Polar Ice Caps“) that, “The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that U.S. agriculture, including livestock production, accounts for only about 8% of total greenhouse-gas emissions in the country. Livestock in the U.S. have lower greenhouse-gas footprints than in other parts of the world. This is partly because American producers generally use higher-quality feeds, higher-yielding breeds, and more productivity-enhancing technologies such as probiotics, vaccines and growth hormones. Future improvements in feed and animal genetics could further reduce animal-agriculture’s impact. As economists have shown, one should not underestimate the ability of innovation, markets, the courts and private negotiation to resolve the adverse effects of externalities.”\n\nAnd Bloomberg writer Brian K. Sullivan reported on Friday that, “In 2012, forecasters and researchers entered the summer convinced an El Nino would form in the equatorial Pacific and its weather-changing effects would be felt around the world.\n\n“It never happened.\n\n“Now the specter of that failure has cast a shadow over similar predictions in 2014, with many wondering where this year’s El Nino is and if it will ever arrive.”\n\nThe article noted that, “The climate center currently gives El Nino a 65 percent chance of forming later this year and the Australians say it is at least 50 percent.”\n\nMeanwhile, in a look a that changing dynamics of some aspects of U.S. agriculture, Tanzina Vega reported in yesterday’s New York Times that, “When he was 15, an immigration raid at a Japanese flower nursery turned Arturo Flores’s life around.\n\n“The owners needed a new group of workers to replace the ones removed by immigration officials, and Mr. Flores landed a job cutting flowers. He slowly worked his way up to packaging and delivering them. In the mid-1980s he got a call from two businessmen looking to start their own cut-flower business. They asked him to manage deliveries and distribution. Today Mr. Flores, 50, is the president of Central California Flower Growers in Watsonville, a distributor in Santa Cruz County that sells more than 100 varieties of flowers and other plants.\n\n“Farming businesses in the United States are still dominated by whites, but Mr. Flores (whose last name means ‘flowers’ in English) is one of a growing number of Latinos who own or operate farms in the country. While the overall number of farms in the United States decreased by 4 percent from 2007 to 2012, during the same period the number of farms run by Hispanics increased by 21 percent to 67,000 from 55,570, according to data released in May from the government’s 2012 census of agriculture. The numbers signaled a small but consistent pattern of growth in agribusiness among Latinos, many of whom have gone from working in the fields to sitting in the head offices.”\n\nTrade News\n\nAP writer Christopher Bodeen reported on Saturday that, “U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s address to Hawaii’s East-West Center think tank this week drew attention primarily for its focus on the need for a constructive relationship with China to ensure regional peace and stability. However, Kerry touched also on U.S. relationships with five other key players in the region – Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand – some of them locked in contentious disputes with Beijing. He also dwelt at length on the Trans-Pacific Partnership – a free trade pact the U.S. is negotiating with 11 other nations.”\n\nExcerpts from Sec. Kerry’s remarks were also included in the AP report.\n\nBloomberg writer Evgenia Pismennaya reported on Friday that, “Russia is preparing for consumer prices to rise at the fastest pace since 2010 after President Vladimir Putin banned food imports from the U.S. and its allies and backed a sales tax, according to three officials… . [E]arlier decisions by Russia’s food safety watchdog to block pork imports have already added 1 percentage point to inflation this year, Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Alfa Bank in Moscow, said by phone. The bank raised its 2015 inflation forecast to 8 percent.”\n\nYeliz Candemir and Emre Peker reported on Friday at The Wall Street Journa Online that, “Turkey is preparing to ramp up food exports to Russia, hoping to benefit from Moscow’s ban on Western produce amid the conflict in Ukraine…[B]ut rushing to Moscow’s aid as it trades barbs with the West over Ukraine could put Turkey at odds with its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.”\n\nPolicy Issues\n\nKevin Concannon, Undersecretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, indicated on Friday at the USDA blog that, “Several recent media reports have misrepresented how the bi-partisan Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act’s Smart Snacks in School nutrition standards will impact school fundraisers like bake sales.\n\n“I’d like to set the record straight: the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is not imposing federal restrictions on bake sales or fundraisers.\n\n“USDA has given states complete authority to set policies on fundraisers and bake sales that work for them. States are free to allow fundraisers and bake sales featuring foods and beverages that don’t meet the new standards during the school day if they choose. They, not USDA, are responsible for determining the number and the frequency of these events each year.”\n\nRegulations\n\nKimberly Kindy reported on the front page of today’s Washington Post that, “The explosion of new food additives coupled with an easing of oversight requirements is allowing manufacturers to avoid the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for ensuring the safety of chemicals streaming into the food supply.\n\n“And in hundreds of cases, the FDA doesn’t even know of the existence of new additives, which can include chemical preservatives, flavorings and thickening agents, records and interviews show.”\n\nA news release Friday from Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D., Conn.) stated that, “[Rep. DeLauro] and Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) today called on the Obama Administration to issue a strong final rule on menu labeling. DeLauro and Harkin were the chief sponsors of menu labeling legislation for nearly a decade, and authored the provision in the Affordable Care Act that is resulting in chain restaurants across the country coming clean about how many calories are in their food.\n\n“The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a proposed rule in the Federal Register in 2011. Since then, the draft has been stalled at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). DeLauro and Harkin worked carefully with the restaurant industry and the public health community to craft the bipartisan provision, and consider it a crucial step in helping prevent chronic disease.”\n\nAnd Ramsey Cox reported on Friday at The Hill Online that, “Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Wash.) vowed to fight a recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decision to restrict some farming on land near salmon streams.\n\n“‘The Obama administration today chose to shove these new regulations down the throats of Pacific Northwest growers while they go back to the drawing board to determine if these vital crop protection tools even have an impact on endangered salmon,’ Hastings said Thursday.\n\n“The EPA released a settlement agreement that would impose buffer zones for crop protection tools around any body of water with salmon. Hastings accused the administration of using ‘sue and settle’ tactics.”",

The scientists noted that higher stream flow in the Dakotas had occurred even as water use increased. In addition, they said, lower stream flow in some areas could be related in part to groundwater pumping.”\n\nParker Norton, PhD Candidate, was the lead author of the report. His USGS dissertation report is quite large (32MB) but downloadable as a PDF at:\n\n http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2014/5053/\n\nParker Norton makes the following statement in the report:\n\n“This study did not examine forcing factors that may explain the observed streamflow trends, such as climate change, climate variability, land- and water-use changes, or groundwater pumping; however, possible causes are described in the context of the need for further research.” (Page 9, under Introduction, Purpose and Scope)\n\nI find nowhere in Parker Norton’s report any mention of the term “climate shift” as claimed by the LA Times reporter.\n\nThe only instance of the term Climate Change is the above noted on in his intro. He does use the term “climate” a total of 8 times in the body of his report (not counting the references). A review of each of the context of that “climate” term usage finds no attribution of the water shed affects to Climate change and certainly not human-induced climate change.\n\nConclusion: The LA Times reporter confabulated a false narrative of climate change impact from a scientific report in which no such claim was made.\n\nClimate Change media bias clearly at work on the public opinion.

of energy monday shows a substantial increase in the percentage of americanmade small wind turbines being sold to other countries driven in part by congress refusal to act on renewing a key subsidy for the us wind industry which has created uncertainty in the market a vast majority 76 percent of the small wind turbines manufactured in the united states were exported to other countries last year the does 2013 distributed wind market report said thats a big increase from 2012 when only 57 percent of usmade small turbines were exported the market for us turbines is spread across the world too small wind turbines produced here were sold to more than 50 countries the report said with top export markets in italy germany china and mexico among others to compensate for weaker domestic sales us small wind turbine manufacturers shifted their focus to growing international markets the report read importers interviewed for this report indicated that they spent their efforts in more promising international markets as it was hard to justify sales efforts in the united states without consistent policy support at the federal state and utility levels the wind energy industry has struggled to receive consistent policy support particularly within congress which most recently refused to revive the wind production tax credit ptc a 13 billion yearly tax break to the wind industry that has historically helped them compete with fossil fuels the ptc for wind is a subsidy thats been built into the tax code for years to encourage growth in the wind industry but expired on january 1 2014 due to congressional gridlock californias record heat is like nothing youve ever seen yet the california heat this year is like nothing ever seen with records that go back to 1895 the chart below shows average yeartodate temperatures in the state from january through july for each year the orange line shows the trend rising 02 degrees fahrenheit per decade the sharp spike on the far right of the chart is the unbearable heat of 2014 thats not just a new record its a chartbusting 14 degrees higher than the previous record its an exclamation point at the end of a long declarative sentence the high temperatures have contributed to one of the worst droughts in californias history the water reserves in the states topsoil and subsoil are nearly depleted and 70 percent of the states pastures are rated very poor to poor according to the usda by one measure which takes into account both rainfall and heat this is the worst drought ever while the temperatures are extreme theyre not entirely unexpected the orange trend line above is consistent with rising temperatures across the globe average surface temperatures on earth have warmed roughly 14 degrees fahrenheit since 1880 according to nasa the eastern half of the us has had an unusually cool 2014 but its a lone exception compared to the rest of the planet the international panel on climate change which includes more than 1300 scientists forecasts temperatures to rise 25 to 10 degrees fahrenheit over the next century that puts californias record heat well within the range of whats to come turning this hot weather into simply weather oregon agency rejects coal export permit dealing major blow oregons department of state lands on monday dealt a serious blow to ambre energys proposed coal terminal denying a key permit needed for a project to export 88 million tons of coal annually to asia the state agency said despite a twoyear review australiabased ambre energy hadnt done enough to analyze alternatives that would avoid harming tribal fisheries at the port of morrow in boardman where the company had proposed to build a dock to load coal onto barges the project the state agency said in a press release is not consistent with the protection conservation and best use of the states water resources0 this application has been scrutinized for months said mary abrams state lands director we believe our decision is the right one considering our regulatory parameters laid out in oregon law and the wealth of information we have received from the applicant and the public mit study climate talks on path to fall far short of goals experts at the massachusetts institute of technology using a sophisticated computer model examined what they think is the most likely outcome of un climate treaty negotiations and found that the talks are likely to come up short facing a deadline to reach a new treaty by the end of next year in paris the worlds nations seem unwilling to make the kind of pledges that would rein in global warming to safe levels by centurys end the researchers concluded our analysis concludes that these international efforts will indeed bend at the curve of global emissions of carbon dioxide and other planetwarming greenhouse gases they said however our results also show that these efforts will not put the globe on a path consistent with commonly stated longterm climate goals the pessimistic forecast may put new pressure on world leaders to increase their ambition as they gather in september in new york at a meeting called by un secretary general ban kimoonthe goal of which is to give an urgently needed boost to the climate talks the un meeting coincides with the annual climate week activities in new york and with a large protest march being organized by advocates to demand stricter measures to tackle manmade climate change the mit report expectations for a new climate agreement was written by henry jacoby and henry chen of mits program on the science and policy of global change their analysis is based on the assumption that the agreement reached in paris next year will likely involve voluntary pledges not a legally binding formula they said they hope their conclusions however approximate or pessimistic will contribute to a more effective global outcome by stimulating timely and open discussion of potential national actions and their consequences one reason for their pessimism they wrote is that it appears unlikely that the worlds richer countries will live up to their commitments to give 100 billion in aid to poorer nations to help them achieve more ambitious carbon targets minor variations in ice sheet size can trigger abrupt climate change small fluctuations in the sizes of ice sheets during the last ice age were enough to trigger abrupt climate change scientists have found the team which included cardiff university researchers compared simulated model data with that retrieved from ice cores and marine sediments in a bid to find out why temperature jumps of up to ten degrees took place in far northern latitudes within just a few decades during the last ice age the analysis led by germanys alfred wegener institute helmholtz centre for polar and marine research awi is published aug 21 2014 in the scientific journal nature the research confirms that thicker ice sheets increased ocean circulation and transferred more heat to the north due to a redirection of the prevailing winds as the north warmed glaciers retreated the winds returned to normal conditions and the north became cooler once again completing the cycle global warming denial rears its ugly head around the world in english as peoples understanding of climate science grows among both experts and nonexperts alike we become more accepting of the fact that humans are the driving force behind global warming thats because the evidence supporting humancaused global warming is overwhelming hence rejection of that reality is usually based on an incomplete understanding of the scientific evidence there is a pattern among these examples of politicians rejecting the full body of available scientific evidence and the consensus among climate experts each is in an englishspeaking country the ukbased market research firm ipsos mori recently conducted an international survey asking respondents if they agreed with the statement the climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity rejection of humancaused global warming was most prevalent in the usa uk and australia with canada not far behind in 7th these four countries also share the commonality of highly influential fossil fuel industries and the wide reach of the murdoch media empire known for its global warming denial the rejection of inconvenient scientific evidence also originates from conservative political parties in each country that neednt be the case as barry bickmore recently wrote real conservatives are conservationists who value evidence meanwhile these countries are also being battered more frequently by extreme weather australia and the western north america have been hit by heat waves and harsh droughts while cold winter temperatures have chilled the uk and central and eastern usa and canada has joined those regions in being flooded by intense deluges a new study has found that blocking patterns where hot or wet weather remains stuck over a region for weeks causing heat waves or floods are becoming more frequent potentially as a result of humancaused global warming recent research has also found that global warming will intensify droughts global warming denial remains a tenable position for politicians in englishspeaking countries because voters in those regions dont yet view the issue as urgent or a high priority in large part due to the false balance in media coverage of the subject however as people continue to directly experience more intense and frequent extreme weather events this will inevitably change 20140818 monday news below louisville fastestwarming city in us reaches for the brakes researchers at the georgia institute of technology found that since the 1960s urban louisville ky saw its temperature rise above that of its surroundings at a rate greater than any other city in the country and more than double the warming rate of the planet as a whole this trend puts louisville on track to receive another unwanted crown most heatrelated excess deaths in the united states a 2012 report from the natural resources defense council found that years of rising temperatures due to climate change will lead to an additional 18988 deaths by the end of the century the reports made national news at the time but the headlines were unwanted attention and a serious headache for maria koetter the citys newly minted sustainability directorif we cant get it under control were going to be jeopardizing the quality of life for the people in our city she said hired in 2012 as a fulfillment of mayor greg fischers campaign promise koetter was tasked with implementing the citys sustainability plan the heat island findings soon dominated her radar the concept of a heat island is neither new nor unique to louisville urban areas around the world accumulate more heat than their rural surroundings as vegetation yields to sunlightabsorbing pavement and heattrapping pollution however louisville faces some unique challenges located in the ohio river valley the geography acts as a basin for urban and industrial pollution trapping it over the city the region is notorious for air quality problems and urban emissions can drive up local temperatures another issue is the citys tree canopy advocates have long lamented the lack of shade in the metropolitan region a problem that goes beyond aesthetics moisture transportation from trees and other vegetation plays an important role in regulating air temperatures over time foliage diminished as concrete and asphalt crept over the land we have a lot of impervious surface downtown koetter said weve got these five and sixlane streets that hold a lot of heat as the climate warms these problems are poised to get worse though the global average temperature may only rise by 2 to 3 degrees celsius urban temperatures could rise by 10 c or more climate change reflected in altered missouri river flow usgs report says the missouri rivers stream flow has changed significantly over the last 50 years leading to serious water shortages in montana and wyoming and flooding in the dakotas according to a us geological survey report released last month in the dakotas flooding is more common leaving fields too muddy to plant or harvest crops this dichotomy isnt necessarily a surprise climate change models predict that where it is wet it will get wetter and where it is dry it will get drier said matt rice a program director at american rivers a nonprofit conservation organization the mighty missouri river begins in the rocky mountains of western montana flowing east and south for more than 2300 miles before entering the mississippi river north of st louis the missouri and its tributaries provide hydropower as well as water for agriculture energy recreation and municipalities in several states including montana nebraska wyoming and the dakotas climate shifts may be causing the disparate changes in the missouri river basin the usgs report says the scientists noted that higher stream flow in the dakotas had occurred even as water use increased in addition they said lower stream flow in some areas could be related in part to groundwater pumping in the great plains average air temperatures have warmed 3 to 4 degrees in the last century according to the environmental protection agency that contributes to the problem study finds possible link between arctic change and extreme midlatitude weather a team of researchers with members from europe and the us has found a possible link between arctic amplification and severe weather in the northern midlatitude parts of the planet in their paper published in the journal nature geoscience the researchers describe how they conducted a review of the findings of other researchers looking for a connection between arctic warming and extreme weather events and what they found as a result for the past several years planetary researchers have begun to wonder if arctic warming is causing changes to weather in the northern midlatitudes they note as just one example the exceedingly harsh 201314 wintervery low temperatures in parts of north america and well above average rainfall in parts of europe scientists have grown concerned as measurements have indicated that the arctic is warming faster than expectedtwice as fast as the rest of the planet arctic amplification which means snow and ice is melting faster than expected as well during the same time period the midlatitudes have experienced some unusual weatherstronger storms colder winters and hotter summers several groups have looked to see if a discernible link between the two trends could be found and while no single team has been able to find concrete evidence many have found what appears to an indirect link in this new effort the researchers suggest that such studies when looked at as a single entity provide a strong case for such a link and they even suggest how changes to the jet stream to storm tracks and to planetary waves and their associated energy propagation taken together the researchers report the data indicates that a weaker temperature gradient between the arctic region and the northern latitudes is leading to changes in the atmosphere in the northern hemisphere and because of that unpredictable changes to weather patterns brazil makes progress on saving forests indonesia risks setbacksreport brazil has made good progress in safeguarding the amazon rainforest but indonesias plans for its forests could face setbacks under a new government a report commissioned by top forest aid donor norway said on monday norway rich from offshore oil and gas paid 103 billion crowns 17 billion to slow tropical deforestation from 200813 according to the report by the statefunded norwegian agency for development cooperation norad brazils deforestation rate and corresponding greenhouse gas emissions have strongly decreased the report said of progress in protecting the amazon the biggest tropical forest projects funded by norwegian cash in brazil were paving the way for future reductions it said norway has paid brazil 46 billion crowns 720 million to help back up domestic programs it said norway promised brazil up to 10 billion in 2008 to slow deforestation depending on its performance under a similar deal in 2010 norway pledged up to 1 billion to indonesia which has the thirdlargest rainforest after the amazon and congo basins and has cleared large areas to make way for palm oil plantations indonesia had made good progress in planning to protect forests norad said but it said that upcoming governmental change and weaknesses in the legal basis for forest protection present a serious risk that achievements may be lost presidentelect joko widodo takes over form susilo bambang yudhoyono in october there could be new priorities ida hellmark who coordinated the report at norad told reuters pointing to risks of a further shift to palm oil plantations so far indonesia has so far got just 2 percent of norways total payments norad said forests soak up carbon dioxide as they grow and release it when they rot or burn deforestation mainly to clear land for farms accounts for up to about a fifth of all manmade emissions of greenhouse gases according to un estimates as climate changes underwater mortgage may take on new meaning looking to buy a house thats great unless youre in your 20s and 30s and regularly read climate reports they tend to project dramatic changes to the climate over the next 50 years and given that current life expectancy is hovering around 80 well likely be around to see it so if youre looking to settle down for the long haul wheres the best place to do it benjamin preston deputy director of the climate change science institute at the oak ridge national laboratory has risen to the challenge he says that most studies come down to simply a question of temperature coastal cities and water availabilitythose are the big driving forces by capturing those forces in equations and then letting them loose in scientifically rigorous and for now makebelieve computer worlds preston and the climate science community can articulate where those forces are likely to hit hardest for decades theres been a sustained southern migration to states like florida arizona and new mexico as people have voted with their feet preston says moving for the work and the weather those sunny skies might grow oppressive with temperature averages reaching five to nine degrees fahrenheit warmer later in the century at which point people might have second thoughts average temperatures in the southwest jumped nearly two degrees fahrenheit in the 2000s an increase over the previous two decades which each saw record increases as well for all the talk about carbon this and hurricane that fresh water availability in cities and for agriculture is probably the sleeping giant preston says thats particularly true for regions that rely on their neighbors dwindling resources for everything from tap water to irrigation the southwest is fundamentally a desert region while the northeast corridor and much of the pacific northwest tend to be reasonably resource rich in terms of water resource availability he says from a purely climateoriented perspective the region from the great lakes over to new england is perhaps better off preston says 20140817 sunday news below heavy rain and floods the new normal with climate change as people clean up after torrential rains and heavy flooding last week in cities in the midwest and along the atlantic coast the events highlight what many climate researchers say is a new normal for severe rainfall in the us quite apart from what longterm changes in precipitation say about global warming these events also provide a reality check on the ability of urban areas to cope with flooding from intense downpours in a warming climate they definitely can tell us a lot about where our vulnerabilities are and what types of things might be on the checklist for fixing says joe casola staff scientist with the center for climate and energy solutions in arlington va during the past 110 years average precipitation has increased over much of the continental us during the past 54 years the amount of rain or snow falling from the top 1 percent of intense storms has increased in every region with the northeast and midwest recording the largest increases according to the latest national climate assessment from the federal governments us global change research program released in may those trends are expected to continue as the climate warms with the wet areas generally growing wetter and the dry regions growing still more arid last weeks storms fit the pattern the continuing growth of cities with their paved surfaces and limited open land where rainwater can be absorbed will increase the risk of flooding even from storms less extreme that those that occurred during the past week to reduce the effect of paving in preventing the ground from absorbing water some cities are using porous paving materials concrete or asphalt in roads and sidewalks green roofs on buildings and even the widespread use of household rain barrels can help reduce runoff from roofs another impervious surface one way to address the issue of money for improvements to the way cities handle storm water is through the use of socalled state revolving funds the us environmental protection agency makes available for water resource and waterquality projects many republicans privately support action on climate in stark contrast to their partys public stance on capitol hill many republicans privately acknowledge the scientific consensus that human activity is at least partially responsible for climate change and recognize the need to address the problem however they see little political benefit to speaking out on the issue since congressional action is probably years away according to former congressmen former congressional aides and other sources in bloomberg bna interviews with several dozen former senior congressional aides nongovernmental organizations lobbyists and others conducted over a period of several months the sources cited fears of attracting an electoral primary challenger as one of the main reasons many republicans choose not to speak out most say the reluctance to publicly support efforts to address climate change has grown discernibly since the 2010 congressional elections when tea partybacked candidates helped the republican party win control of the house in part by targeting vulnerable democrats for their support of legislation establishing a national emissions capandtrade system climate change needs to be in the mix of all of our other discussions former rep steve latourette rohio who represented his ohio district from 1995 through 2013 in the house and is now president of mcdonald hopkins government strategies told bloomberg bna i do think privatelyand some not so privatelyrepublicans are coming to the point where this has been an issue thats been pretty much settled with regard to the science a lot of it has to do with people calming down and saying lets have a conversation a landmark deal in mississippi could give a big boost to utilityscale solar southern company which owns mississippi power ranks nearly last when it comes to utilities use of renewable energy however a settlement announced earlier this week could open up as much as 100 megawatts of solar and wind in mississippi the gulfportbased utility recently reached a settlement with the local chapter of the sierra club to diversify its fuel mix away from coal in exchange for mississippi powers commitment to convert from coal to natural gas and procure more solar and wind energy the sierra club has agreed to stop its legal and regulatory opposition to the kemper coal gasification power plant the utility will pursue solar and wind powerpurchase agreements and make all good faith efforts to obtain an arrangement with approximately 100 mw in nameplate capacity and for a term of at least ten years the powerpurchase agreements can be financed through its rate base mississippi power also agreed not to oppose net metering rules for residential solar that are now being considered by the states public service commission it also committed to 15 million in energy efficiency programs if the pieces fall into place for an rfp it will likely attract a number of the solar developers that have been increasingly active in the southeast to mississippi georgia power won approval from the state public service commission to purchase 210 megawatts of solar by the end of this year it now has two programs a 100megawatt residential solar procurement and 425 megawatts from utilityscale systems that are expected to be in service by the end of 2016 california drought transforms global food market crop switching is one sign of a sweeping transformation going on in california the nations biggest agricultural state by value driven by a threeyear drought that climate scientists say is a glimpse of a drier future the result will affect everything from the price of milk in china to the source of cherries eaten by americans it has already inflamed competition for water between farmers and homeowners growers have adapted to the recordlow rainfall by installing hightechnology irrigation systems watering with treated municipal wastewater and even recycling waste from the processing of pomegranates to feed dairy cows some are taking land out of production altogether bulldozing withered orange trees and leaving hundreds of thousands of acres unplanted an estimated 82 percent of california is experiencing extreme drought according to the us drought monitor agriculture has been hard hit as it consumes about fourfifths of the water that isnt set aside for environmental preservation some farmers are paying as much as 10 times more for water than what it cost before the drought there will be some definite changes probably structural changes to the entire industry as drought persists said american farm bureau federation president bob stallman farmers have made changes theyve shifted this is what farmers do in the long term california will probably move away from commodity crops produced in bulk elsewhere to highvalue products that make more money for the water used said richard howitt a farm economist at the university of california at davis the state still has advantages in almonds pistachios and wine grapes and its location means it will always be wellsituated to export what can be profitably grown that may mean less farmland in production as growers abandon corn and cotton because of the high cost of water corn acreage in california has dropped 34 percent from last year and wheat is down 53 percent according to the usda cotton planting has fallen 60 percent over the decade while almonds are up by more than half on its own california would be the worlds ninthlargest agricultural economy according to a university of california at davis study

Fox's \"Cosmos\" won four Emmys, including \"Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming.\" Showtime's \"Years Of Living Dangerously\" won the top award, \"Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series\" (along with PBS's \"American Masters\"). And no, TV junkies, you didn't miss the big Emmys telecast, which airs Monday, August 25th. Saturday night was the Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. \"COSMOS: A SpaceTime Odyssey,\" for those who missed it, is the Fox network's high-tech update of the original Carl Sagan series on PBS, but with Neil deGrasse Tyson in the narrator role. I'm not sure a stronger defense of science and the scientific method has ever appeared on network TV. Nor was Tyson shy about discussing the reality of climate science. \"Years of Living Dangerously\" is the first documentary series devoted to climate change ever to appear on a major network or premium cable. Its nine episodes were produced by James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Jerry Weintraub and three former 60 Minutes producers. I was Chief Science Advisor for the series alongside Heidi Cullen. Earlier this month, \"Years\" was named as the first honoree of the 2014 Environmental Media Awards, winning \"The EMA Outstanding Achievement for Environmental Content Award.\" The landmark series generated dozens of major news stories and more than a billion (!) media impressions. Former 60 Minutes producer Joel Bach, an Executive Producer of \"Years\" and series co-creator with David Gelber, told me: YEARS received great fanfare on Showtime -- hopefully this will put another spotlight on the show and encourage new audiences to watch it on Amazon and the like. Also, this fall the National Wildlife Federation will be releasing YEARS lesson plans in middle schools, high schools and colleges around the country. Our goal has always been to tell the story of climate change to as many people as possible, and this Emmy win goes a long way towards helping accomplish that goal. Yes, the good news for those 80 percent of households who don't subscribe to Showtime is that the entire series will be available on DVD September 7, and Amazon has begun taking preorders already. More U.S.-Made Wind Turbines Are Being Sold Overseas as Congress Fails to Support Wind Power A report released by the Department of Energy Monday shows a substantial increase in the percentage of American-made small wind turbines being sold to other countries, driven in part by Congress' refusal to act on renewing a key subsidy for the U.S. wind industry, which has created uncertainty in the market. A vast majority -- 76 percent -- of the small wind turbines manufactured in the United States were exported to other countries last year, the DOE's 2013 Distributed Wind Market Report said. That's a big increase from 2012, when only 57 percent of U.S.-made small turbines were exported. The market for U.S. turbines is spread across the world, too -- small wind turbines produced here were sold to more than 50 countries, the report said, with top export markets in Italy, Germany, China, and Mexico, among others. \"To compensate for weaker domestic sales, U.S. small wind turbine manufacturers shifted their focus to growing international markets,\" The report read. \"Importers interviewed for this report indicated that they spent their efforts in more promising international markets ... as it was hard to justify sales efforts in the United States without consistent policy support at the federal, state, and utility levels.\" The wind energy industry has struggled to receive consistent policy support particularly within Congress, which most recently refused to revive the Wind Production Tax Credit (PTC) -- a $13 billion yearly tax break to the wind industry that has historically helped them compete with fossil fuels. The PTC for wind is a subsidy that's been built into the tax code for years to encourage growth in the wind industry, but expired on January 1, 2014 due to Congressional gridlock. California's Record Heat Is Like Nothing You've Ever Seen... Yet The California heat this year is like nothing ever seen, with records that go back to 1895. The chart below shows average year-to-date temperatures in the state from January through July for each year. The orange line shows the trend rising 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit per decade. The sharp spike on the far right of the chart is the unbearable heat of 2014. That's not just a new record; it's a chart-busting 1.4 degrees higher than the previous record. It's an exclamation point at the end of a long declarative sentence. The high temperatures have contributed to one of the worst droughts in California's history. The water reserves in the state's topsoil and subsoil are nearly depleted, and 70 percent of the state's pastures are rated \"very poor to poor,\" according to the USDA. By one measure, which takes into account both rainfall and heat, this is the worst drought ever. While the temperatures are extreme, they're not entirely unexpected. The orange trend line above is consistent with rising temperatures across the globe. Average surface temperatures on Earth have warmed roughly 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, according to NASA. The eastern half of the U.S. has had an unusually cool 2014, but it's a lone exception compared to the rest of the planet. The International Panel on Climate Change, which includes more than 1,300 scientists, forecasts temperatures to rise 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century. That puts California's record heat well within the range of what's to come, turning this \"hot weather\" into, simply, \"weather.\" Oregon Agency Rejects Coal Export Permit, Dealing Major Blow Oregon's Department of State Lands on Monday dealt a serious blow to Ambre Energy's proposed coal terminal, denying a key permit needed for a project to export 8.8 million tons of coal annually to Asia. The state agency said despite a two-year review, Australia-based Ambre Energy hadn't done enough to analyze alternatives that would avoid harming tribal fisheries at the Port of Morrow in Boardman, where the company had proposed to build a dock to load coal onto barges. The project, the state agency said in a press release, \"is not consistent with the protection, conservation and best use of the state's water resources.\"0 \"This application has been scrutinized for months,\" said Mary Abrams, state lands director. \"We believe our decision is the right one, considering our regulatory parameters laid out in Oregon law, and the wealth of information we have received from the applicant and the public.\" MIT Study: Climate Talks on Path to Fall Far Short of Goals Experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, using a sophisticated computer model, examined what they think is the most likely outcome of UN climate treaty negotiations and found that the talks are likely to come up short. Facing a deadline to reach a new treaty by the end of next year in Paris, the world's nations seem unwilling to make the kind of pledges that would rein in global warming to safe levels by century's end, the researchers concluded. \"Our analysis concludes that these international efforts will indeed bend at the curve of global emissions\" of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gases, they said. \"However, our results also show that these efforts will not put the globe on a path consistent with commonly stated long-term climate goals.\" The pessimistic forecast may put new pressure on world leaders to increase their ambition as they gather in September in New York at a meeting called by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon--the goal of which is to give an urgently needed boost to the climate talks. The UN meeting coincides with the annual Climate Week activities in New York, and with a large protest march being organized by advocates to demand stricter measures to tackle man-made climate change. The MIT report, \"Expectations for a New Climate Agreement,\" was written by Henry Jacoby and Henry Chen of MIT's program on the science and policy of global change. Their analysis is based on the assumption that the agreement reached in Paris next year will likely involve voluntary pledges, not a legally binding formula. They said they hope their conclusions, however approximate or pessimistic, \"will contribute to a more effective global outcome by stimulating timely and open discussion of potential national actions and their consequences.\" One reason for their pessimism, they wrote, is that it appears unlikely that the world's richer countries will live up to their commitments to give $100 billion in aid to poorer nations to help them achieve more ambitious carbon targets. Minor Variations in Ice Sheet Size Can Trigger Abrupt Climate Change Small fluctuations in the sizes of ice sheets during the last ice age were enough to trigger abrupt climate change, scientists have found. The team, which included Cardiff University researchers, compared simulated model data with that retrieved from ice cores and marine sediments in a bid to find out why temperature jumps of up to ten degrees took place in far northern latitudes within just a few decades during the last ice age. The analysis, led by Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), is published Aug. 21, 2014 in the scientific journal Nature. The research confirms that thicker ice sheets increased ocean circulation and transferred more heat to the north due to a redirection of the prevailing winds. As the north warmed, glaciers retreated, the winds returned to normal conditions, and the north became cooler once again, completing the cycle. Global Warming Denial Rears Its Ugly Head Around the World, in English As people's understanding of climate science grows, among both experts and non-experts alike, we become more accepting of the fact that humans are the driving force behind global warming. That's because the evidence supporting human-caused global warming is overwhelming ; hence rejection of that reality is usually based on an incomplete understanding of the scientific evidence. There is a pattern among these examples of politicians rejecting the full body of available scientific evidence and the consensus among climate experts -- each is in an English-speaking country. The UK-based market research firm Ipsos MORI recently conducted an international survey asking respondents if they agreed with the statement, \"The climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity.\" Rejection of human-caused global warming was most prevalent in the USA, UK, and Australia, with Canada not far behind in 7th. These four countries also share the commonality of highly influential fossil fuel industries, and the wide reach of the Murdoch media empire, known for its global warming denial. The rejection of inconvenient scientific evidence also originates from conservative political parties in each country. That needn't be the case; as Barry Bickmore recently wrote, real conservatives are conservationists who value evidence. Meanwhile, these countries are also being battered more frequently by extreme weather. Australia and the western North America have been hit by heat waves and harsh droughts, while cold winter temperatures have chilled the UK and central and eastern USA, and Canada has joined those regions in being flooded by intense deluges. A new study has found that \"blocking patterns,\" where hot or wet weather remains stuck over a region for weeks causing heat waves or floods, are becoming more frequent, potentially as a result of human-caused global warming. Recent research has also found that global warming will intensify droughts. Global warming denial remains a tenable position for politicians in English-speaking countries because voters in those regions don't yet view the issue as urgent or a high priority, in large part due to the false balance in media coverage of the subject. However, as people continue to directly experience more intense and frequent extreme weather events, this will inevitably change. __ 2014-08-18 Louisville, Fastest-Warming City in U.S., Reaches for the Brakes Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology found that since the 1960s, urban Louisville, Ky., saw its temperature rise above that of its surroundings at a rate greater than any other city in the country and more than double the warming rate of the planet as a whole. This trend puts Louisville on track to receive another unwanted crown: most heat-related excess deaths in the United States. A 2012 report from the Natural Resources Defense Council found that years of rising temperatures due to climate change will lead to an additional 18,988 deaths by the end of the century. The reports made national news at the time, but the headlines were unwanted attention and a serious headache for Maria Koetter, the city's newly minted sustainability director.\"If we can't get it under control, we're going to be jeopardizing the quality of life for the people in our city,\" she said. Hired in 2012 as a fulfillment of Mayor Greg Fischer's campaign promise, Koetter was tasked with implementing the city's sustainability plan. The heat island findings soon dominated her radar. The concept of a heat island is neither new nor unique to Louisville. Urban areas around the world accumulate more heat than their rural surroundings as vegetation yields to sunlight-absorbing pavement and heat-trapping pollution. However, Louisville faces some unique challenges. Located in the Ohio River Valley, the geography acts as a basin for urban and industrial pollution, trapping it over the city. The region is notorious for air quality problems, and urban emissions can drive up local temperatures. Another issue is the city's tree canopy. Advocates have long lamented the lack of shade in the metropolitan region, a problem that goes beyond aesthetics; moisture transportation from trees and other vegetation plays an important role in regulating air temperatures. Over time, foliage diminished as concrete and asphalt crept over the land. \"We have a lot of impervious surface downtown,\" Koetter said. \"We've got these five- and six-lane streets that hold a lot of heat.\" As the climate warms, these problems are poised to get worse. Though the global average temperature may only rise by 2 to 3 degrees Celsius, urban temperatures could rise by 10 C or more. Climate Change Reflected in Altered Missouri River Flow, USGS Report Says The Missouri River's stream flow has changed significantly over the last 50 years, leading to serious water shortages in Montana and Wyoming and flooding in the Dakotas, according to a U.S. Geological Survey report released last month. In the Dakotas, flooding is more common, leaving fields too muddy to plant or harvest crops. This dichotomy isn't necessarily a surprise. \"Climate change models predict that where it is wet, it will get wetter, and where it is dry, it will get drier,\" said Matt Rice, a program director at American Rivers, a nonprofit conservation organization. The mighty Missouri River begins in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, flowing east and south for more than 2,300 miles before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis. The Missouri and its tributaries provide hydropower as well as water for agriculture, energy, recreation and municipalities in several states, including Montana, Nebraska, Wyoming and the Dakotas. Climate shifts may be causing the disparate changes in the Missouri River Basin, the USGS report says. The scientists noted that higher stream flow in the Dakotas had occurred even as water use increased. In addition, they said, lower stream flow in some areas could be related in part to groundwater pumping. In the Great Plains, average air temperatures have warmed 3 to 4 degrees in the last century, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That contributes to the problem. Study Finds Possible Link Between Arctic Change and Extreme Mid-Latitude Weather A team of researchers with members from Europe and the U.S. has found a possible link between Arctic amplification and severe weather in the northern mid-latitude parts of the planet. In their paper published in the journal Nature Geoscience, the researchers describe how they conducted a review of the findings of other researchers looking for a connection between Arctic warming and extreme weather events and what they found as a result. For the past several years planetary researchers have begun to wonder if Arctic warming is causing changes to weather in the northern mid-latitudes. They note, as just one example, the exceedingly harsh 2013/14 winter--very low temperatures in parts of North America and well above average rainfall in parts of Europe. Scientists have grown concerned as measurements have indicated that the Arctic is warming faster than expected--twice as fast as the rest of the planet (Arctic amplification), which means snow and ice is melting faster than expected as well. During the same time period, the mid-latitudes have experienced some unusual weather--stronger storms, colder winters and hotter summers. Several groups have looked to see if a discernible link between the two trends could be found. And while no single team has been able to find concrete evidence, many have found what appears to an indirect link. In this new effort, the researchers suggest that such studies, when looked at as a single entity, provide a strong case for such a link, and they even suggest how: changes to the jet stream, to storm tracks and to planetary waves and their associated energy propagation. Taken together, the researchers report, the data indicates that a weaker temperature gradient between the Arctic region and the northern latitudes, is leading to changes in the atmosphere in the northern hemisphere and because of that, unpredictable changes to weather patterns. Brazil Makes Progress on Saving Forests, Indonesia Risks Setbacks-Report Brazil has made good progress in safeguarding the Amazon rainforest but Indonesia's plans for its forests could face setbacks under a new government, a report commissioned by top forest aid donor Norway said on Monday. Norway, rich from offshore oil and gas, paid 10.3 billion crowns ($1.7 billion) to slow tropical deforestation from 2008-13, according to the report by the state-funded Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad). \"Brazil's deforestation rate and corresponding greenhouse gas emissions have strongly decreased,\" the report said of progress in protecting the Amazon, the biggest tropical forest. Projects funded by Norwegian cash in Brazil were \"paving the way for future reductions\", it said. Norway has paid Brazil 4.6 billion crowns ($720 million) to help back up domestic programs, it said. Norway promised Brazil up to $1.0 billion in 2008 to slow deforestation, depending on its performance. Under a similar deal in 2010, Norway pledged up to $1 billion to Indonesia, which has the third-largest rainforest after the Amazon and Congo basins and has cleared large areas to make way for palm oil plantations. Indonesia had made \"good progress\" in planning to protect forests, Norad said. But it said that \"upcoming governmental change and weaknesses in the legal basis\" for forest protection \"present a serious risk that achievements may be lost\". President-elect Joko Widodo takes over form Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in October. \"There could be new priorities,\" Ida Hellmark, who coordinated the report at Norad, told Reuters, pointing to risks of a further shift to palm oil plantations. So far, Indonesia has so far got just 2 percent of Norway's total payments, Norad said. Forests soak up carbon dioxide as they grow and release it when they rot or burn. Deforestation, mainly to clear land for farms, accounts for up to about a fifth of all man-made emissions of greenhouse gases, according to U.N. estimates. As Climate Changes, 'Underwater Mortgage' May Take on New Meaning Looking to buy a house? That's great, unless you're in your 20s and 30s and regularly read climate reports. They tend to project dramatic changes to the climate over the next 50 years, and given that current life expectancy is hovering around 80, we'll likely be around to see it. So. If you're looking to settle down for the long haul, where's the best place to do it? Benjamin Preston, deputy director of the Climate Change Science Institute at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, has risen to the challenge. He says that most studies come down to simply \"a question of temperature, coastal cities, and water availability--those are the big driving forces.\" By capturing those forces in equations and then letting them loose in scientifically rigorous and (for now) make-believe computer worlds, Preston and the climate science community can articulate where those forces are likely to hit hardest. For decades, there's been a sustained southern migration to states like Florida, Arizona, and New Mexico, as people have \"voted with their feet,\" Preston says, moving for the work and the weather. Those sunny skies might grow oppressive with temperature averages reaching five to nine degrees Fahrenheit warmer later in the century, at which point people might have second thoughts. Average temperatures in the Southwest jumped nearly two degrees Fahrenheit in the 2000s, an increase over the previous two decades, which each saw record increases as well. For all the talk about \"carbon this\" and \"hurricane that,\" fresh water availability in cities and for agriculture \"is probably the sleeping giant,\" Preston says. That's particularly true for regions that rely on their neighbors' dwindling resources for everything from tap water to irrigation. The Southwest is fundamentally a desert region, while the Northeast corridor and much of the Pacific Northwest \"tend to be reasonably resource rich in terms of water resource availability,\" he says. \"From a purely climate-oriented perspective, the region from the Great Lakes over to New England is perhaps better off,\" Preston says. __ 2014-08-17 Heavy Rain and Floods: the 'New Normal' with Climate Change? As people clean up after torrential rains and heavy flooding [last week] in cities in the Midwest and along the Atlantic Coast, the events highlight what many climate researchers say is a new \"normal\" for severe rainfall in the US. Quite apart from what long-term changes in precipitation say about global warming, these events also provide a reality check on the ability of urban areas to cope with flooding from intense downpours in a warming climate. They \"definitely can tell us a lot about where our vulnerabilities are and what types of things might be on the checklist for fixing,\" says Joe Casola, staff scientist with the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions in Arlington, Va. During the past 110 years, average precipitation has increased over much of the continental US. During the past 54 years, the amount of rain or snow falling from the top 1 percent of intense storms has increased in every region, with the Northeast and Midwest recording the largest increases, according to the latest National Climate Assessment from the federal government's US Global Change Research Program, released in May. Those trends are expected to continue as the climate warms, with the wet areas generally growing wetter and the dry regions growing still more arid. Last week's storms fit the pattern. The continuing growth of cities, with their paved surfaces and limited open land where rainwater can be absorbed, will increase the risk of flooding, even from storms less extreme that those that occurred during the past week. To reduce the effect of paving in preventing the ground from absorbing water, some cities are using porous paving materials -- concrete or asphalt -- in roads and sidewalks. Green roofs on buildings and even the widespread use of household rain barrels can help reduce runoff from roofs, another impervious surface. One way to address the issue of money for improvements to the way cities handle storm water is through the use of so-called state revolving funds the US Environmental Protection Agency makes available for water resource and water-quality projects. Many Republicans Privately Support Action On Climate In stark contrast to their party's public stance on Capitol Hill, many Republicans privately acknowledge the scientific consensus that human activity is at least partially responsible for climate change and recognize the need to address the problem. However, they see little political benefit to speaking out on the issue, since congressional action is probably years away, according to former congressmen, former congressional aides and other sources. In Bloomberg BNA interviews with several dozen former senior congressional aides, nongovernmental organizations, lobbyists and others conducted over a period of several months, the sources cited fears of attracting an electoral primary challenger as one of the main reasons many Republicans choose not to speak out. Most say the reluctance to publicly support efforts to address climate change has grown discernibly since the 2010 congressional elections, when Tea Party-backed candidates helped the Republican Party win control of the House, in part by targeting vulnerable Democrats for their support of legislation establishing a national emissions cap-and-trade system. \"Climate change needs to be in the mix of all of our other discussions,\" former Rep. Steve LaTourette (R-Ohio), who represented his Ohio district from 1995 through 2013 in the House and is now president of McDonald Hopkins Government Strategies, told Bloomberg BNA. \"I do think privately--and some not so privately--Republicans are coming to the point where this has been an issue that's been pretty much settled with regard to the science. A lot of it has to do with people calming down and saying let's have a conversation.\" A Landmark Deal in Mississippi Could Give a Big Boost to Utility-Scale Solar Southern Company, which owns Mississippi Power, ranks nearly last when it comes to utilities' use of renewable energy. However, a settlement announced earlier this week could open up as much as 100 megawatts of solar and wind in Mississippi. The Gulfport-based utility recently reached a settlement with the local chapter of the Sierra Club to diversify its fuel mix away from coal. In exchange for Mississippi Power's commitment to convert from coal to natural gas and procure more solar and wind energy, the Sierra Club has agreed to stop its legal and regulatory opposition to the Kemper coal gasification power plant. The utility will pursue solar and wind power-purchase agreements and make \"all good faith efforts to obtain an arrangement with approximately 100 MW in nameplate capacity and for a term of at least ten years.\" The power-purchase agreements can be financed through its rate base. Mississippi Power also agreed not to oppose net metering rules for residential solar that are now being considered by the state's Public Service Commission. It also committed to $15 million in energy efficiency programs. If the pieces fall into place for an RFP, it will likely attract a number of the solar developers that have been increasingly active in the Southeast to Mississippi. Georgia Power won approval from the state public service commission to purchase 210 megawatts of solar by the end of this year. It now has two programs -- a 100-megawatt residential solar procurement and 425 megawatts from utility-scale systems -- that are expected to be in service by the end of 2016. California Drought Transforms Global Food Market Crop switching is one sign of a sweeping transformation going on in California -- the nation's biggest agricultural state by value -- driven by a three-year drought that climate scientists say is a glimpse of a drier future. The result will affect everything from the price of milk in China to the source of cherries eaten by Americans. It has already inflamed competition for water between farmers and homeowners. Growers have adapted to the record-low rainfall by installing high-technology irrigation systems, watering with treated municipal wastewater and even recycling waste from the processing of pomegranates to feed dairy cows. Some are taking land out of production altogether, bulldozing withered orange trees and leaving hundreds of thousands of acres unplanted. An estimated 82 percent of California is experiencing extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Agriculture has been hard hit as it consumes about four-fifths of the water that isn't set aside for environmental preservation. Some farmers are paying as much as 10 times more for water than what it cost before the drought. \"There will be some definite changes, probably structural changes, to the entire industry\" as drought persists, said American Farm Bureau Federation President Bob Stallman. \"Farmers have made changes. They've shifted. This is what farmers do.\" In the long term, California will probably move away from commodity crops produced in bulk elsewhere to high-value products that make more money for the water used, said Richard Howitt, a farm economist at the University of California at Davis. The state still has advantages in almonds, pistachios and wine grapes, and its location means it will always be well-situated to export what can be profitably grown. That may mean less farmland in production as growers abandon corn and cotton because of the high cost of water. Corn acreage in California has dropped 34 percent from last year, and wheat is down 53 percent, according to the USDA. Cotton planting has fallen 60 percent over the decade, while almonds are up by more than half. On its own, California would be the world's ninth-largest agricultural economy, according to a University of California at Davis study. Shifts in its production reverberate globally, said Dan Sumner, another agricultural economist at the school. Mexico Opens Its Grid to Competition As part of a wider reform of its energy market, Mexico is privatizing its energy regulator and will begin allowing private companies to sell energy to, and add capacity to, its electricity grid. The country's president, Enrique Pena Nieto, enacted the laws (English summaries) on Monday, August 11th (Spanish pdf). Petroleum and electricity have been state monopolies in law since the 1917 constitution and in practice since the late 1930s, when Mexico succeeded in expropriating foreign energy firms' holdings. The change in direction is in part a response to very poor productivity: Mexican industrial customers pay around 72 percent more than American counterparts for electricity, according to a Deloitte report (pdf). PriceWaterhouseCoopers estimates that the Mexican grid has 18 percent transmission losses, over double the OECD average of seven percent (pdf). A 2005 IEA report on other countries' liberalization experiences calls grid liberalization \"a long process rather than an event.\" Japan, which began liberalizing its electricity market in 1995, is now conducting its 5th reform. The European Union began in 1996, has decreed three reforms so far, and still has a long way to go. Oaxaca state congressman Juan Jose Moreno Sada, of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) said last week at CIER that the culture of Mexico's regulators would have to change along with the laws to prevent corruption. Another criticism of the new law is that it is too focused on fossil fuels, which accounted for almost a third of government revenues last year. At last week's meeting, Yesenia Nolasco Ramirez, a congresswoman from Oaxaca in the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), complained that the reforms don't offer enough support to clean energies. While a 2012 climate law establishes a goal of 35 percent of Mexican energy coming from renewable sources by 2024, it lacks sufficient enforcement mechanisms, she said, and this year's energy reform do not add them. \"From my point of view it's a step backwards,\" she said.",

The Missouri and its tributaries provide hydropower as well as water for agriculture, energy, recreation and municipalities in several states, including Montana, Nebraska, Wyoming and the Dakotas.\n\nClimate shifts may be causing the disparate changes in the Missouri River Basin, the USGS report says. The scientists noted that higher stream flow in the Dakotas had occurred even as water use increased. In addition, they said, lower stream flow in some areas could be related in part to groundwater pumping.\n\n“Understanding stream flow throughout the watershed can help guide management of these critical water resources,” said USGS hydrologist Parker Norton, lead author of the report that focuses on stream flow. The study is part of his doctoral research, which will analyze precipitation patterns, temperatures and their effects.\n\nIn the Great Plains, average air temperatures have warmed 3 to 4 degrees in the last century, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Nearly 30,000 farms and ranches bring in $4.2 billion to Montana annually, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That would drop dramatically without water.\n\nNorby grows malted barley and sugar beets on 3,000 acres of irrigated land near Sidney.

Premiums for “prevented planting” insurance — which protects them if they cannot plant because of drought or flooding — have soared because of an upsurge in claims, the USDA says.\n\nIn 2007, South Dakota had about 613,000 acres eligible for prevented planting payments, according to reports from the USDA Risk Management Agency.

it was about a very detailed study of streamflows in the missouri river watershed which can be downloaded here findings support a climatological forcing for the upward trends the study noted significant changes over time there was an upward trend in streamflow in some regions and a downward trend in others the nature of the upward trend lends support for climatological forcing other work identified that the downward trend is at least in part because of groundwater pumping in the trend analysis at the end of the report the authors wrote either upward or downward significant trends in annual monthly and seasonal streamflow were pervasive within three watershed regions downward trends in wr1 upper missouri river upward trends in wr3 great plains and central lowland physiographic provinces and niobrara river and downward trends in wr5 kansas river watershed a comprehensive analysis of cause of trends is outside the scope of this report an increase in diversions or consumptive use of water during the study period however could not result in upward trends in annual streamflows over broad regions such as wr3 all seven hcdn streamgages in wr3 have upward trends which supports a climatological forcing for the upward trends although not examined in this study an increase in consumptive use because of groundwater pumping has been identified as a contributing factor to the downward trends in wr5 wen and xunhong 2006 downward trends in wr1 the upper missouri river were significant throughout this region and even on mainstem streamgages below reservoirs such as streamgages 06177000 and 06185500 map numbers 20 and 21 respectively in wr1 and streamgage 06342500 map number 53 in wr2 two out of eight hcdn streamgages had downward trends streamgage 06278300 map number 32 and streamgage 06298000 map number 40 whereas the remaining hcdn streamgages had no significant streamflow trends future studies could examine the forcing factors of these observed trends in streamflow the watershed effects and potential long term consequences now compare that with what was written at wuwt archived here to start with anthony wrote the article based on a comment by one of his fans joel obryan who has had quite a few of his comments quoted here at hotwhopper he tends to make really dumb comments and gets very worked up about climate science word search vs reading the words joel did something a bit unusual for a science denier he went and checked the paper after reading a report in the los angeles times well he obviously didnt actually read the paper what he did was do a search for the word climate i guess thats why he missed the synthesis of trends which was just above the summary at the end of the report because it used the word climatological not climate as an aside when i read a long paper that is structured in this manner i start with the abstract and some of the introduction then the conclusion then the discussion and maybe the conclusion again then go back and read the paper in full if ive time and the paper interests me the joel obryans of the world apparently just do a word search to see what the research finds ill classify that as denier weirdness joel was more thorough in his word search than in his comprehension he was complaining that the la times reporter maya srikrishnan wrote climate change reflected in altered missouri river flow report says climate shifts may be causing the disparate changes in the missouri river basin the usgs report says the scientists noted that higher stream flow in the dakotas had occurred even as water use increased in addition they said lower stream flow in some areas could be related in part to groundwater pumping note her use of the words reflected and may not caused or did and therefore is consistent with the way the link was expressed in the report itself compare that to the words used in the report itself all seven hcdn streamgages in wr3 have upward trends which supports a climatological forcing for the upward trends although not examined in this study an increase in consumptive use because of groundwater pumping has been identified as a contributing factor to the downward trends in wr5 wen and xunhong 2006 that looks to me like a fair interpretation of the report not so for joel who whined i find nowhere in parker nortons report any mention of the term climate shift as claimed by the la times reporter the only instance of the term climate change is the above noted on in his intro he does use the term climate a total of 8 times in the body of his report not counting the references a review of each of the context of that climate term usage finds no attribution of the water shed affects to climate change and certainly not humaninduced climate change conclusion the la times reporter confabulated a false narrative of climate change impact from a scientific report in which no such claim was made climate change media bias clearly at work on the public opinion i give the la times reporter maya srikrishnan four pinocchios on this article — pants on fire the la times was correct and wuwt was wrong joel jumped to the wrong conclusion based solely on a word search thing is he didnt read the report or he would have discovered that his word search was inadequate for what he wanted joel found this sentence at the beginning of the report which he obviously thought added weight to his complaint joel wrote parker norton makes the following statement in the report this study did not examine forcing factors that may explain the observed streamflow trends such as climate change climate variability land and wateruse changes or groundwater pumping however possible causes are described in the context of the need for further research page 9 under introduction purpose and scope the report didnt examine the forcing factors but that doesnt mean that they couldnt draw inferences which they did and which the la times reported the entire study is monitoring changes in stream flows the researchers analysed and reported the changes and then made reasonable inferences from their work if joel had looked further hed also have found this from a press release on the usgs website itself climate changes that affect how and where moisture is delivered to the continent may be causing some of these trends in the missouri river basin although the usgs scientists did not conduct a complete analysis of the causes they noted that increased streamflow over broad regions occurred despite the increasing use of water decreased streamflow in some areas could also be related to climate change factors or to groundwater pumping so the reporter would have originally been alerted to the paper by the usgs press release not only that but she spoke to people the scientists and local farmers not a dissertation joel also described the paper as the dissertation report of the lead author parker a norton who is a hydrologist at the usgs dissertations are not normally written by multiple authors ironically i think joel made that mistake because of something the la times journalist wrote about whom he had just wrongly claimed had confabulated a false narrative the la times stated about parker norton and this paper the study is part of his doctoral research which will analyze precipitation patterns temperatures and their effects heres a video from parker norton in which he describes their work from the wuwt comments johnwho says august 18 2014 at 614 am i suspect if we analyzed every main stream media msm article that discusses global warmingclimate change in some manner we would find a marked distortion between what the journalist says and what the scientist or science paper reports remember the media is the message not the facts or the truth i wonder what would happen if johnwho started analysing every wuwt article rogerknights didnt get as far as reading the paper itself and he confuses the usgs with a university still his wondering was otherwise not bad august 18 2014 at 635 am maybe there was a mention of climate change in the universitys press release or in an interview of the author evanmjones might even be becoming less sceptical of agw because he says not very enigmatically august 18 2014 at 638 am the more climate changes the more it stays the same doug s draws on religion and says august 18 2014 at 650 am its important for the religious believers in global warming to keep singing the hymnals of doom its a way for them to reach out to their fellow parishioners and communicate their faith in the cause its a curious and sad thing to observe in many cases desperate people with all kinds of substance abuse problems andor depression are easy pickings for the evangelicals of the cause a person who sees the world through the eyes of their personal depression and doom will find a sense of comfort in the thought that the world is doomed also by the power and glory of the cause all hail the cause and may it come to power over the earth blessed be the cause sorry couldnt resist this heretical moment for which i will surely burn in a deniers hell dccowboy decides that climate changing is not the same as a change in the climate and says excerpt rogerknights quote removed august 18 2014 at 658 am i think there was a mention of climate by one of the coauthors in an interview but it hardly assigns blame to climate change or climate shifts what is apparent is that the climate is changing and that it is being reflected in the stream flow conditions said mark anderson director of the usgs water science center in south dakota and another of the reports authors well sure the climate is changing then again isnt it always chez who discovered the press release but didnt bother to read the report because she says august 18 2014 at 710 am unfortunately the usgs press release was less circumspect than the report see httpwwwusgsgovnewsroomarticleaspid3944uihz7yszck theo goodwin says august 18 2014 at 711 am the only instance of the term climate change is the above noted on in his intro he does use the term climate a total of 8 times in the body of his report not counting the references a review of each of the context of that climate term usage finds no attribution of the water shed affects to climate change and certainly not humaninduced climate change maya found the word climate and launched into climate change aka poetic license from there what do you expect from todays reporters for decades postmodern english professors have taught them that truth is what serves the interests of the writer frank k says he finds it disconcerting that no scientist will correct things hes wrong many of them do or try to in this case there was nothing to correct or not too much that i could see in that particular article at the la times a couple of minor niggles like a farmer growing malted barley instead of barley for malting or malting barley im doing my bit to correct the incorrect reporting at wuwt if only the wuwt deniers did the same he says august 18 2014 at 738 am conclusion the la times reporter confabulated a false narrative of climate change impact from a scientific report in which no such claim was made this is par for the course with the msm what i find disconcerting is that none of the mainstream climate scientists who proclaim to be all about the science ever respond to this type of misrepresentation and try to correct it by the way if youre like me and have no faith in the veracity or objectivity of our msm just remove them from your life delete links to their sites and apps that use their sites dont purchase their news products papers magazines etc or watch their shows on tv and encourage your friends and family to do the same – eventually their sponsors will begin to notice look at cnn for example they are in freefall as only airports and some sports bars are tuned to their shows anymore par for the course at wuwt frank k wrote about par for the course whats par for the course is that not a single commenter at wuwt bothered to check the wuwt article by going to the report itself not one of them showed that the report supported the la times article not one of them read the usgs report or if they did not one of them noticed that the report itself drew an inference about climate change affecting streamflows in the missouri river watershed or if they did notice not one of them said so at wuwt parker a norton mark t anderson and john f stamm trends in annual seasonal and monthly streamflow characteristics at

Some warming has occurred in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean in the recent fortnight, due to a weakening of the trade winds. If the trade winds remain weak, more warming towards El Niño thresholds is possible.The Bureau’s ENSO Tracker remains at WATCH status. This means the chance of an El Niño developing in 2014 is at least 50%, which is double the normal likelihood of an event. Five of the eight climate models surveyed by the Bureau suggest El Niño is likely for spring. However, if El Niño were to occur, it is unlikely to be a strong event.",

            "text": "Sorry, Mississippi River fans, the nation’s longest river is actually the Missouri.  As this news story makes clear, though, the changes on the Missouri are of a sort that will bring big impacts to the Mississippi as well.\n\nIt’s not really a surprise that some parts of the Missouri are seeing too little water while others are seeing too much.  Climate change reports for some time have indicated that dry areas will trend drier and wet areas wetter.  A USGS report released recently documents those changes across a broad area (227 stream gages) and through a span of better than 50 years.\n\nIn some ways, the varying reception of this news is more significant than the documented changes.  Some farmers are simply adapting, aware that conditions always change in the uncertain world of agriculture.  People in other sectors of the economy are likewise concerned, and adapting.  Fishing is a major economic activity, contributing over $3 billion annually in Montana alone.  No one is quite sure what the changed river conditions are going to mean to this industry.\n\nStill others don’t seem to really accept that the climate is changing, arguing that poor river management by the agencies involved with the Missouri River are to blame.  The Corps of Engineers comes in for criticism, of course.\n\nWhatever the cause, the evidence in front of people shows that the river is changing.  As one source said, ”We no longer have a smooth, easy-going river,” he said. “It’s choppy and eroding the banks and just pretty ugly at this point in time.”\n\nAnd that’s perhaps the most interesting part of the story, for me at least.  People in a changing landscape respond to the differences they can see, that are most directly affecting their daily lives.  The river is different–”we no longer have…”  The explanations they offer for change vary almost on a person by person basis, and may or may not be grounded in science, in a systematic understanding of policy or any other set of ideas other than their own values and beliefs.\n\nThe rivers are changing.  What do we do now?",

similar to august of 2013 sundays rains helped alleviate some of those fears and more heavy showers and storms today should put a dent in the recent dry spell the minnesota dnr explains that between june 15 and august 12 rainfall amounts over parts of southern mn were 25 below average as of august 12 the drought monitor shows that a small area of south central minnesota has been categorized as abnormally dry so why has the drought been slow to return to minnesota there are two main reasons one is that this summer dry spell came on the heels of the wettest june on record for the state and secondly it hasnt been too warm the preliminary statewide average temperature departure for july 2014 was the same as the twin cities at 23 degrees below normal august so far has had a pattern of near

journal science climate scientists in austria used climate models and an international inventory of glacial measurements to determine how much of what were seeing can be attributed to the burning of fossil fuels and how much is just natural variation what they found is that since the mid19th century humans have been responsible for about 25 percent of the observed melt but when you look at whats

            "text": "Climate change is altering the flow of the Missouri River, the nation’s longest, causing increased streamflow in some parts and decreased flow in others, according to a new report.\n\nThe report, published by the U.S. Geological Survey, looked at streamflow data from 227 streamgages — tools that estimate water flow — in the Missouri River from over the past 50 years. According to the study, almost half of the streamgages showed either increasing or decreasing trends in flow since 1960. In the eastern part of the river’s watershed, which includes parts of North and South Dakota and Iowa, streamflows have increased, while in western states like Montana and Wyoming, streamflow has decreased.\n\nMontana farmer Rocky Norby told the LA Times that streamflows got so low on his farm last year that he was forced to spend more than $10,000 to unclog the sand from his irrigation system. Norby’s farm depends heavily on irrigation — if he wasn’t able to irrigate his crops, he said his production would drop significantly.\n\n“Every year it gets worse,” he said. “There’s not enough water to get through our pumps.”\n\nThe Missouri River provides “critical water resources” to agriculture and energy and also serves as a source of drinking water for some towns and cities along its path, USGS hydrologist Parker Norton said in a statement.\n\n“Understanding streamflow throughout the watershed can help guide management of these critical water resources,” he said.\n\nClimate change is likely playing a role in the river’s changes in streamflow, Mark Anderson, one of the report’s authors, told the LA Times. Dennis Todey, a climatologist at South Dakota University, explained further, telling the paper that changes in precipitation are likely what’s partially to blame for the changes in streamflow.\n\n“If you look at Wyoming and Montana, you see a decline in precipitation, but farther east into the Dakotas, there is a well-documented increase in precipitation,” Todey said. “More water, more opportunities for flooding.”\n\nThe problems the Missouri River is facing could be reflected in rivers worldwide as the earth continues to warm. In 2007, a study published in Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment predicted that many rivers that are impacted by dams or other development will need major changes in management to make them more resilient to climate change.\n\n“As a result of damming and development, major rivers worldwide have experienced dramatic changes in flow, reducing their natural ability to adjust to and absorb disturbances,” lead author of the study Margaret Palmer said. “Given expected changes in global climate and water needs, this could lead to serious problems for both ecosystems and people.”",

feed all became sick another group of animals given a placebo were not infected with the virus the study did not look into how the feed became infected with the pedv we did the study and that was for

the usgs report says the scientists noted that higher stream flow in the dakotas had occurred even as water use increased in addition they said lower stream flow in some areas could be related in part

greenhousegas footprints than in other parts of the world this is partly because american producers generally use higherquality feeds higheryielding breeds and more productivityenhancing technologies

Livestock in the U.S. have lower greenhouse-gas footprints than in other parts of the world. This is partly because American producers generally use higher-quality feeds, higher-yielding breeds, and more productivity-enhancing technologies such as probiotics, vaccines and growth hormones. Future improvements in feed and animal genetics could further reduce animal-agriculture’s impact. As economists have shown, one should not underestimate the ability of innovation, markets, the courts and private negotiation to resolve the adverse effects of externalities.”\n\nAnd Bloomberg writer Brian K.

He slowly worked his way up to packaging and delivering them. In the mid-1980s he got a call from two businessmen looking to start their own cut-flower business. They asked him to manage deliveries and distribution. Today Mr. Flores, 50, is the president of Central California Flower Growers in Watsonville, a distributor in Santa Cruz County that sells more than 100 varieties of flowers and other plants.\n\n“Farming businesses in the United States are still dominated by whites, but Mr. Flores (whose last name means ‘flowers’ in English) is one of a growing number of Latinos who own or operate farms in the country. While the overall number of farms in the United States decreased by 4 percent from 2007 to 2012, during the same period the number of farms run by Hispanics increased by 21 percent to 67,000 from 55,570, according to data released in May from the government’s 2012 census of agriculture. The numbers signaled a small but consistent pattern of growth in agribusiness among Latinos, many of whom have gone from working in the fields to sitting in the head offices.”\n\nAnd in trade news, AP writer Christopher Bodeen reported on Saturday that, “U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry’s address to Hawaii’s East-West Center think tank this week drew attention primarily for its focus on the need for a constructive relationship with China to ensure regional peace and stability. However, Kerry touched also on U.S. relationships with five other key players in the region — Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand — some of them locked in contentious disputes with Beijing. He also dwelt at length on the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a free trade pact the U.S. is negotiating with 11 other nations.”\n\nExcerpts from Sec.

States are free to allow fundraisers and bake sales featuring foods and beverages that don’t meet the new standards during the school day if they choose. They, not USDA, are responsible for determining the number and the frequency of these events each year.”\n\nRegulations\n\nKimberly Kindy reported on the front page of today’s Washington Post that, “The explosion of new food additives coupled with an easing of oversight requirements is allowing manufacturers to avoid the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for ensuring the safety of chemicals streaming into the food supply.\n\n“And in hundreds of cases, the FDA doesn’t even know of the existence of new additives, which can include chemical preservatives, flavorings and thickening agents, records and interviews show.”\n\nA news release Friday from Rep.

Since then, the draft has been stalled at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). DeLauro and Harkin worked carefully with the restaurant industry and the public health community to craft the bipartisan provision, and consider it a crucial step in helping prevent chronic disease.”\n\nAnd Ramsey Cox reported on Friday at The Hill Online that, “Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Wash.) vowed to fight a recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decision to restrict some farming on land near salmon streams.\n\n“‘The Obama administration today chose to shove these new regulations down the throats of Pacific Northwest growers while they go back to the drawing board to determine if these vital crop protection tools even have an impact on endangered salmon,’ Hastings said Thursday.\n\n“The EPA released a settlement agreement that would impose buffer zones for crop protection tools around any body of water with salmon. Hastings accused the administration of using ‘sue and settle’ tactics.”\n\nKeith Good",

            "text": "Stream flows are changing in major ways along the Missouri River thanks in large part to climate change, and those shifts are having big impacts on thousands of farmers, businesses, vacationers and others who depend on it.\n\nThe news comes in a U.S. Geological Survey study published in late July, which examined stream flow data from more than 200 streamgages up and down the Missouri between 1960 and 2011.\n\nNearly half of the streamgages surveyed showed that flows had increased or decreased over time during the past 50 years, with areas in the river's eastern watershed -- in states like Iowa and the Dakotas -- experiencing higher streamflows, while those further west were lower.\n\nThat has led to serious water shortages for farmers in places like Montana, where one farmer told the Los Angeles Times he'd had to spend more than $10,000 to remove sand that had choked the irrigation system he uses to farm sugar beets and malted barley.\n\n\"Every year it gets worse,\" Rocky Norby, who has farmed his Montana land along the Missouri for more than two decades, said in an interview with the Times. \"There's not enough water to get through our pumps.\"\n\nBut they're seeing the opposite problem to the east, in places like North and South Dakota, where fields along the river are often too muddy from flooding to plant.\n\nIt's a pattern climate scientists expect to continue in a world that keeps getting warmer. \"Climate change models predict that where it is wet, it will get wetter, and where it is dry, it will get drier,\" Matt Rice, a program director at the conservation nonprofit American Rivers, told the Times.\n\nTemperatures already have increased between 3 and 4 degrees Fahrenheit in the Great Plains, the Environmental Protection Agency says, and a rise of roughly 5 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit is expected for the Missouri River basin by 2050.\n\nThe nation's longest river, the Missouri begins high up in the Rocky Mountains of Montana and stretches more than 2,500 miles through 10 states before it reaches St. Louis, where it merges with the Mississippi. Together, the river and its tributaries encompass roughly one-sixth of the continental U.S.\n\nThat means the river is a critical resource for tens of millions of people. “The Missouri River and its tributaries are valuable for agriculture, energy, recreation and municipal water supplies,” said Parker Norton, a USGS hydrologist and the study lead author. “Understanding streamflow throughout the watershed can help guide management of these critical water resources.”\n\nThe study also cautions that climate change isn't the only reason the Missouri has experienced such big changes in streamflow patterns, pointing out that higher streamflows had been recorded even in places where water usage also had risen, in places like the Dakotas.\n\nGroundwater pumping also may be to blame for lower flows in some areas, the authors note. But the impacts are undeniable, especially in states like Montana, where the Times noted that some of its famous fishing areas have had to be closed during the tourist season because of \"low flows, high temperatures and too much stress on fish.\"\n\nRead the full story in the Los Angeles Times or download the study from the U.S. Geological Survey.",

It plays a crucial role for the communities that depend on it for hydro energy, tourism and irrigation.\n\nIn addition to suffering from bad water quality  because of excessive development, pollution and agricultural runoff, scientists have discovered that the river also had its stream flow altered by climate change.\n\nData collected by researchers has in fact shown that in the eastern part of the river’s watershed, which includes areas of North and South Dakota and Iowa, stream flows have increased, while decreasing in western Montana and Wyoming.\n\nThis means that while certain areas happened to be flooded, others suffered from water shortage. This will enormously affect farming activity that developed in the region, with climate change being blamed for changes in precipitation patterns that could have caused the alteration of the flow.\n\nMark Anderson, director of the USGS Water Science Center in South Dakota and one of the study’s authors said, “What is apparent is that the climate is changing and that it is being reflected in the stream flow conditions”.\n\nLead author and USGS hydrologist Parker Norton added, “The Missouri River and its tributaries are valuable for agriculture, energy, recreation and municipal water supplies.\n\n“Understanding stream flow throughout the watershed can help guide management of these critical water resources.”\n\nPhoto:  USFWS Mountain-Prairie  via flickr\n\nCalifornia drought: policymakers agree to tackle climate change to end extreme drought\n\nGovernment must invest more in flood defences, say MPs\n\nReducing river pollution could offset some climate change impacts\n\nWater levels decrease with more rain and less snow, says study\n\nClimate change increasing flood risk in the UK",

rapidly perpetuated financial woes for the city is that payouts for retirement benefits have increased in recent years thus crowding out services the city provides a study released in early april by the stanford institute for economic policy research found that for the city of los angeles pension costs increased from 85 percent of total city expenditures in 1999 to 137 percent in 2011 for fiscal

which grew at 52 percent on health and sanitation 36 percent and on recreation and cultural services 58 percent and it occurred while spending on public assistance programs fell by an average of 30

The situation is similar to that in other California cities such as Stockton and Vallejo. The tsunami of unfunded pension liabilities and health benefits is about to hit the shoreline of Los Angeles. And if Stanford University’s estimates are correct, Los Angeles is facing roughly $27 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. For a city whose annual budget is in the $7 billion range this year, that figure is daunting. The Big Budget Picture Budget gaps are no rarity for the City of Angels in recent years. It seems like an annual tradition. In fiscal year 2011-2012, the city projected a budget shortfall of more than $400 million. For 2010-11’s fiscal year, the tune was the same. As was 2009-10, and so on. L.A.’s chief administrative officer, Miguel Santana, noted that the budget shortfall is likely to be much greater by 2014-15. “Every year it gets worse,” he said. The chain of events is always the same. City officials announce a budget shortfall and the mayor seeks to bandage it with gimmicks that fail to address the underlying causes. Criticizing Villaraigosa’s approach to last year’s budget shortfall, City Controller Wendy Greuel said that ”kicking the can down the road is not a solution when we can anticipate a growing structural deficit in future years.” She was referring specifically to a plan Villaraigosa outlined to borrow money to solve part of the deficit. But her summation applies to the inept budgeting approach of the city for years. Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan predicted increased hardships and eventual bankruptcy if drastic action wasn’t taken by city officials. In an editorial he penned in the Wall Street Journal in 2010, he wrote, “Los Angeles is facing a terminal fiscal crisis: Between now and 2014 the city will likely declare bankruptcy.” Riordan is not shying away from those comments. In a recent phone conversation, he told me that bankruptcy for L.A. could come “as early as next year.” Ballooning Pension Costs What has rapidly perpetuated financial woes for the city is that payouts for retirement benefits have increased in recent years, thus crowding out services the city provides. A study released in early April by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research found that, for the city of Los Angeles, “Pension costs increased from 8.5 percent of total city expenditures in 1999 to 13.7 percent in 2011.” For fiscal year 2011-12, estimated pension costs look to have climbed to “15.4 percent of city expenditures.” Stanford’s study also estimated that each of the city’s three independent pension funds is unfunded by billions of dollars: the city of Los Angeles Fire and Police Pension System is $9.25 billion unfunded; the Los Angeles City Employees’ Retirement System is $11.32 billion unfunded; and the city of Los Angeles Water and Power Employees’ Retirement System is $6.59 billion unfunded. “In 1999, Los Angeles City’s aggregate annual required contributions for its three systems totaled $291 million, rising to $923 million in 2011, an annual average growth rate of 11.1 percent,” according to the Stanford report. But here is the kicker: The growth in pension spending by the city “outpaced that of spending on public protection, which grew at 5.2 percent, on health and sanitation (3.6 percent), and on recreation and cultural services (5.8 percent), and it occurred while spending on public assistance programs fell by an average of 3.0 percent per year.” If the trend continues, the city will be little more than a professional retirement payment and processing service. Union Power Economic downturn aside, interminable spending fueled by powerful unions has pushed Los Angeles to the brink of bankruptcy. As Riordan argues, unions basically control the Los Angeles City Council. For example, “A compensation package negotiated in 2007 irresponsibly guaranteed many city workers more than 25 percent in pay hikes over five years,” according to a Los Angeles Times editorial. And as the city continues its downward spiral, “most employees represented by the Coalition of Los Angeles City Unions are scheduled for 11 percent increases in compensation over the coming two years,” the Times reported. One of the ideas for offsetting some of this year’s budget shortfall was to ask city workers to forgo raises. But the union bosses balked at the idea, claiming that city employees had sacrificed enough in recent years. As for pension benefits, some city employees are able to retire with up to 100 percent of their salaries, a benefit virtually unheard of in the private sector. Triggering Bankruptcy “What will likely trigger bankruptcy is when Wall Street stops buying bonds from [the city of] L.A.,” Riordan told me. “Someone will wake up and say, ‘They aren’t going to have enough money to pay off my bonds,’ and that will be that.” “If you predict ahead three or four years,” Riordan argued, the city will have to “close parks, libraries and cut police and fire services,” similar to what has happened in the cities of Stockton and Vallejo. Tap Dancing Around Reform According to KABC, “Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa says the city has cut a third of the general fund civilian workforce” in recent years. Of course, layoffs will not be enough, and Villaraigosa has argued that city workers will have to assume more costs for their own health care. And he has announced plans for changes to the city’s pension system, including raising the retirement age for new hires to 67 (current workers retire at 55 or 60) and limiting pension benefits so that retirees cannot retire with 100 percent of salary. Union leaders instantly chastised the mayor for his pension proposals, specifically his plan to raise the retirement age. But frankly, his proposals barely scratch the surface of what’s necessary for fiscal sustainability. At the very least, a new, less-generous pension plan has to be created for new employees, something like the 401(k) plans private sector employees have. Jan Perry, a Los Angeles city councilwoman and candidate for mayor, told me, “A new pension tier for people not even hired is completely reasonable to pursue.” Pension expert Marcia Fritz said that all of the city’s employees should pay at least half of pension costs. “This eliminates the employer paid pension contribution and will reduce pension costs as a whole,” she said. “Another thing L.A. should do,” if bankruptcy becomes reality, “is break retiree health contracts,” she said. “They weren’t prefunded, so are empty promises, and courts have allowed retiree health to be lumped in with other unsecured creditors.” The best option would be to adjust promised benefit levels for current workers. Some experts believe, as Fritz also noted, that “fiscally distressed agencies may have the ability to adjust benefits for current workers.” She argued that there is a growing precedent that governments can call on employees to increase retirement contributions and suspend cost-of-living increases when municipal or agency funds are at unhealthy levels. Still, these necessarily bold approaches are untested. Of course, another option to fix the hole would be astronomical tax increases, which would likely only delay real solutions. Riodan balked at the idea, asking, “Can you imagine L.A. quadrupling their taxes? Everyone would flee the city and the state.” Even with the city’s challenges, as hard is it may be to believe, Riordan contended: “L.A. is better off than a lot of cities” in California and elsewhere. If that’s the case, there is a bumpier road ahead.

flash drought similar to august of 2013 sundays rains helped alleviate some of those fears and more heavy showers and storms today should put a dent in the recent dry spell the minnesota dnr explains that between june 15 and august 12 rainfall amounts over parts of southern mn were 25 below average as of august 12 the drought monitor shows that a small area of south central minnesota has been categorized as abnormally dry so why has the drought been slow to return to minnesota there are two main reasons one is that this summer dry spell came on the heels of the wettest june on record for the state and secondly it hasnt been too warm the preliminary statewide average temperature departure for july 2014 was the same as the twin cities at 23 degrees below normal august so far has had a

Like a wife who hasn't kicked me to the curb in 30 years, great friends, and a father who just turned 84 - still able to travel & recall stories that leave me shaking my head in wonder.\n\nWith the daily challenges and setbacks of life it's easy to lose sight of a simple truth: we were all very lucky to have been born in this time and place. Most of the planet would love to have our problems.\n\nAmerica is also home to the most severe weather on Earth. Why? No east-west mountain range like the Alps in Europe - nothing to block the movement of cold and hot; setting up a recipe ripe for meaty, momentous storms.\n\nThat temperature tango plays out overhead this week, sparking a Conga Line of storms. The NAM prints out 1-2 inches rain today; 90s and even a few 100-degree highs to our south over Iowa later this week. No blast-furnace heat here, but expect a muggy start to the State Fair with a few thundery lumps, especially Saturday. Canada flushes cooler, drier air south of the border by Sunday with a dew point in the 40s.\n\nI wonder if Canadians complain about \"American Air\"?\n\nSunday Soakers. As much as 4-5\" of rain was reported near Welch, far southeast metro, triggering flash flooding, even a few roads washed out from the sudden deluge. 1-2\" amounts were common over the far southern and southwest suburbs, with 4-5\" reported near Montevideo, nearly 4\" at Glenwood, from slow-moving thunderstorms. Doppler radar rainfall estimates courtesy of the MPX National Weather Service.\n\nA Volatile Atmosphere. Drier air pushing southward (dew points in the 50s over northern Minnesota) created a sharp frontal boundary Sunday; dew points in the low 70s over much of southern Minnesota - truly tropical air. A cold twist of air aloft helped to ignite thunderstorms, and although they were below severe criteria, relatively slow forward motion created significant rainfall amounts south and west of the Twin Cities. More storms fire along that same boundary again today. Sunday afternoon visible loop: NOAA and HAMweather.\n\nA Fleeting June Flashback. No, this won't be a rerun of June, historically the wettest month on record, statewide, for Minnesota. But slow-moving storms will drop another 1-3\" of rain today, with the heaviest amounts south of the Minnesota River. Heavy showers and storms push into the Great Lakes, another swarm spreading from the Ohio Valley and Mid South into the Carolinas. 4 KM NAM accumulated rainfall: NOAA and HAMweather.\n\nA Sticky Week - September Breeze by Sunday? Long-range guidance shows the best chance of showers and T-storms today; again Saturday. Expect a sticky week with dew point consistently in the 60s to near 70 thru Saturday, highs pushing well into the 80s again later in the week (probably warmer than displayed above, especially Thursday and Friday when mid and upper 80s are possible). European guidance suggests a sharp cool frontal passage late Saturday with dew points tumbling into the 40s, even some 30s by Sunday and Monday. Right now Sunday looks like the better/drier/sunnier, more comfortable day to troll the Minnesota State Fair.\n\nAn End To The Midsummer Dry Spell over Southern Minnesota? Farmers were beginning to worry a bit, fearing another \"flash drought\" similar to August of 2013. Sunday's rains helped alleviate some of those fears, and more heavy showers and storms today should put a dent in the recent dry spell. The Minnesota DNR explains that between June 15 and August 12 rainfall amounts over parts of southern MN were 2-5\" below average: \"...As of August 12, the Drought Monitor shows that a small area of south central Minnesota has been categorized as \"Abnormally Dry\". So why has the drought been slow to return to Minnesota? There are two main reasons. One is that this summer dry spell came on the heels of the wettest June on record for the state, and secondly it hasn't been too warm. The preliminary statewide average temperature departure for July 2014 was the same as the Twin Cities at 2.3 degrees below normal.
