measures of soothing and baffling expedience of delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences we can not avoid this period we are in it now winston churchill november 12 1936 17 july 2008 dear friends and so the moment arrives in my first scream crash boom letter of 2005 i forecast the inevitable crash of the global ecosystem i said the resulting economic and social crises would then drive an investment boom in a new industrial revolution and economic transformation i thought i was forecasting events a decade or two away now just three years later look around us the global economy is trembling under its own weight we see riots and political crises across asia as surging food prices driven by extreme climatic events and surging economic growth put severe pressure on the daily lives of billions of people protests strikes and political upheaval across the world as oil prices respond to the reality of limited supply threatening recession or worse global financial markets lurching from crisis to crisis as complexity greed and interconnectedness drives the financial system to the edge debate about external military intervention in countries that cant deal with the humanitarian consequences of extreme weather such as burma scientists mystified by dramatic increases in melting at the northern polar and antarctic icecaps at rates way beyond their forecast models and countless more impacts with floods and fires in the usa droughts and dying rivers in australia melting glaciers all over the world and on and on the ecosystem crash i thought was decades away is now underway and the resulting economic crash is not far behind perhaps the slide has already begun as our global market empire eats its way through the natural resources of the planet stealing from our children it now overextends as all empires do before they decline desperate for more resources to feed its hungry masses to shore up the middle classs wealth to keep the elites supportive and to protect itself the system makes promises of continued riches promises it can no longer keep look how our system responds to oil prices – a response so ridiculous its almost funny we see that our addiction to a nonrenewable polluting resource threatens the economy our solution to try to increase supply and reinforce our dependency madness surrounds us now this empire has no emperor there is no senate no central committee no board of directors noone is in charge and noone can control what happens next the system is too complex and intertwined and the momentum is too great the system is breaking down and we need to prepare for whats coming when we look back 2008 will be a momentous year in human history our children and grandchildren will ask us what was it like what were you doing when it started to fall apart could you see it what did you think what did you do often in the middle of something momentous we cant see its significance but for me there is no doubt 2008 will be the marker – the year when the great disruption began we are already seeing the response though modest governments know the costs of inaction on climate change far outweigh the costs of acting they are rolling out carbon pricing across the developed world investors too are waking up to the biggest opportunity of the 21st century – decarbonising and cleaning up the economy they are pumping billions into what they see as a kind of dotcom boom on steroids with military support this is all good but it is all too late to stop the crash that we are at this point should not be a surprise to anyone who looks at the numbers the science and the behaviour of society throughout history for decades weve been alerted to the risks with clear data on the scientific demographic and economic trends true to our nature and our history however when we dont want to believe no amount of data can change our mind in the 1970s the infamous club of rome report the limits to growth written by my good friend jorgen randers and his colleagues1 forecast this situation and explained the simple obvious and still true underlying logic if you keep growing an economy based on the consumption of nonrenewable resources at some point they will run out and that model of economic growth will stall they argued that if we didnt prepare for this well in advance major economic and social disruption would result they gave us 35 years warning although it sold many millions of copies it was vilified by those whose interests it threatened it was countered as it still is today by those technooptimists who believe that some combination of markets and technology would allow us to respond as the crisis hit with some relatively minor adjustments maybe if wed acted 35 years ago but certainly not now more recently studies such as the millennium ecosystem assessment also raised the alarm that comprehensive peer reviewed scientific analysis by 1300 experts assessed the consequences of ecosystem change for human wellbeing the final report concluded at the heart of this assessment is a stark warning human activity is putting such strain on the natural functions of earth that the ability of the planets ecosystems to sustain future generations can no longer be taken for granted many other studies such as the wwf living planet report have concluded that we are already operating 25 above the planets biological capacity to support life on earth2 now we forecast a 50 increase in population and a 300 to 400 increase in per capita income using the same models of consumption madness all obvious in hindsight obvious to jorgen randers and his colleagues 35 years ago obvious to future generations looking back who will be mystified by our lack of response given the data available to us anyway we can wonder at our ability to ignore the obvious and we can analyse our societys capacity for denial but it wont change anything now it is what it is the system has spoken it is in a state of crash we will now begin the challenge of dealing with the crash and then the extraordinarily interesting and exciting process of building a new sustainable economy furthermore we will do all this at a speed we can barely imagine sitting here today of course we cant know with certainty what will occur on climate change for example there has never been an event like this in earths history where such a massive amount of co2 has suddenly in geological timeframes been released into the atmosphere let alone into a severely degraded and stressed ecosystem this carbon was absorbed from the atmosphere over many many millions of years and laid down securely under the earths crust as oil gas and coal this caused temperatures on earth to drop to a level suitable for humans to live grow food and build this civilisation now weve taken it out again and dumped it back in the atmosphere such a huge co2 release can not occur naturally so theres no precedent from which to understand the impact so we cant be sure of the result but logic and all the indications say it will be ugly why then with this uncertainty am i so convinced that a major crisis is inevitable ive worked on these issues for over 30 years around the world including at the highest levels in the ngo and corporate sectors ive observed and learnt a great deal about how the system works how issues develop and how change unfolds importantly i have also learned to trust my intuition and my judgement on this in summary the following is why we will see a crash of the ecosystem and the economy before we get serious about change we have built an incredibly complex interlinked global society and economic system while were very proud of our creation its very complexity makes it highly prone to shocks the interconnectedness we marvel at could well be our downfall as parallel shocks bring the whole system down this is very well argued by thomas homerdixon in his excellent book the upside of down 3 so the question is will those shocks occur and how large will they be our economy as currently constructed is unsustainable this is well established in the analysis referred to earlier the only major unknown is how fast and by what process we will change history indicates that we dont accept large scale change easily especially when this change challenges our accepted beliefs it generally takes a crisis to overcome our resistance the challenge of sustainability particularly climate change has characteristics that make our normal resistance to change both deeper and longer lasting it is an enormous systemwide challenge that affects every person and every country it requires sweeping change in every aspect of our lives and our society it also questions many fundamental beliefs about growth and the market economy and threatens some very powerful interests all this deepens our resistance unfortunately this means the crisis will have to be very large and completely undeniable before we respond this problem is also unusual in that the impacts lag the causes current global warming for example is caused by co2 emissions from decades ago so when the crisis is big enough to force change it will also have great and unstoppable momentum as a result it will be far more damaging because the impacts will continue to worsen long after we act on the causes it is due to both the scale and the lag that the idea that markets will respond in time with price signals and technology is such a false hope yes markets and society will respond dramatically but the task of transformation is now so large and so comprehensive that achieving it will take decades achieving it smoothly while maintaining a stable global economy in the middle of multiple simultaneous global crises is simply too much to expect so how will this unfold if you grow an economy or any system up against its limits it then stops growing and either changes form or breaks down to a simpler system this applies to a petri dish of bacteria a plague of locusts a species in a forest or to a global economy it is basic physics and biology as our system hits its limits the following pressures will combine in varied and unpredictable ways to trigger a system breakdown and a major economic crisis or series of smaller crises that will see us slide into a sustained economic downturn and a global emergency lasting decades a series of ecological social and economic shocks driven by climate change particularly melting polar regions extreme weather events and changes to agricultural output will generate severe economic stresses along with deep concern in the public and the global elites this will lead to strong government intervention and generate a sense of global crisis the combined pressures of increasing demand and lower agricultural output driven by climate change will lead to sustained increases in food prices – triggering economic and geopolitical instability and tension with developing countries blaming the west for causing climate change a deeply degraded global ecosystem will further reduce the capacity of key ecosystem services – water fisheries and agricultural land this will again impact food and water supply political stability and global security we will see even further sustained and rapid increases in oil prices as peak oil is breached yes it will go up and down but the trend will be clear this will create enormous system wide economic and political pressure as well as a great conflict between expanding dirtier supply and cutting co2 emissions as always in predicting the future there will be surprises these could be for example a serious global terrorist attack wiping out a major city or a pandemic shutting down global travel shocks upon shocks upon shocks as this unfolds our deeply intertwined and complex global financial market prone to panic driven by fear and uncertainty will suddenly wake up to the long term implications of all of this perhaps driven by a series of major corporate collapses or national economic crises they will then simply reprice risk in global share markets this will lead to a dramatic drop in global share markets and a tightening of capital supply over she goes the resulting series of economic and political crises will be massive in scale and decades long they will last this long simply because fixing the causes while dealing with the consequences – a declining economy political instability and accelerating climate change driven by earlier emissions – will take decades with this level of crisis and change the future becomes quite unpredictable and anything is possible including some very exciting transformational shifts why do i see this starting now the system is too complex for analytically based certain predictions we cant even predict the oil price let alone the behaviour of the whole system however my intuition is screaming at me that now is the time and the data i see confirms my intuition if we go back to basics the two key challenges we face – the availability of cheap resources to feed the economy and the ability of the earths ecosystem to absorb our impacts – both have very clear indicators so as the system hits the wall we should see a significant noncyclical rise in commodity prices – especially food and energy – and significant evidence of accelerating ecosystem breakdown these have for several years been my canaries in the end of growth coalmine we see these indicators hitting hard now and the drivers behind them are profound well embedded and have significant lags in them so its game on from this point forward the slide into crisis will define our political and economic world the debate about the benefits of growth are now irrelevant we will not choose to stop growing we are taking a system operating past its capacity and driving it faster and harder no matter how wonderful the system is the laws of physics and biology still apply the economy will stop growing and then contract – a depression our whole global political and economic system has been built on incessant growth so this crisis will strike at the heart of society growth is the underpinning policy focus and strategic assumption of all governments central banks corporations and investment funds it is never questioned and anything less leads to intervention to restart it so when growth stops things get very difficult people throw out governments shareholders throw out boards and boards throw out ceos so we can expect all that before we face up to reality – we have a system design problem is this all too pessimistic and gloomy im actually by nature a strongly optimistic person i just look at the numbers and the science and i see it coming i want to be clear though that this is not the end of the world it does however herald an unparalleled era of system stress economic stagnation and social tension – a global emergency during which well evolve a new economic model and then rebuild i call it the great disruption because it is most likely to be a disruption in societys evolutionary process rather than the collapse of civilisation this disruption will drive a transformation of extraordinary speed and scale it will leave in the dust all other major global changes weve faced – those driven by war technology or globalising markets it will be an exciting and ultimately positive transformation with great innovation and change in technology business and economic models alongside a parallel shift in human development it could well be in a nonbiological sense a great leap forward for humanity with a move to a higher stage of evolution and consciousness so i find myself soberly accepting the scale of the coming challenges and all the sadness this entails but still confident we will come through this and rebuild why humanity has shown itself to be amazingly resilient history tells us we are most likely to cope with the crisis no matter how bad it gets and that we will grow change and react in positive ways over time yes were resistant to change now but when the crisis hits its consequences will be so overwhelming that denial will disappear virtually overnight then well begin to see extraordinary and rapid shifts yes some people in this coming crisis will do selfish things acting out of fear and insecurity given the scale of change however i believe that more people will do extraordinary noble and positive things there are many historical examples of this so i am a realistic optimist realistic because i see the crash coming and being ugly but optimistic because i see it all as the great disruption – a period through which well pass – rather than a collapse which signifies our end moving forward we certainly know what we need to do we need a zero net carbon emitting economy a society that creates no waste and a distribution of wealth that is more equitable and sees everyones basic needs met we need an economy whose central organising principle is social benefit and human advancement with wealth creation a tool to that end not an end in itself and we know how to get there fixing this is not hard we just havent decided to do so yet we already have leading entrepreneurs communities corporations and governments proving the ideas that we can take to scale when we do as william gibson said the future is here its just not widely distributed yet as well as reinventing our physical infrastructure we will have to work on our social infrastructure developing the community and family connections that build the resilience we need to get through the transition doing so will also be good for us as victor frankl argued in mans search for meaning the search for happiness takes us to love to relationships and to a focus on meaningful achievement personally im preparing for uncertainty and change by focusing on adaptability and building personal resilience we are all going to have to be nimble and travel light when i wrote my first scream crash boom letter in 2005 i slipped into despair because the scale of the challenges seemed overwhelming that took me closer to family recognising that my resilience came from having a close knit home life a base from which to face the world i then realised i needed to look more deeply inside to truly examine my foibles and my lifes focus i needed to know what would bring me greater happiness and what was my highest potential purpose and how to get some of my ego out of the way of getting there through endless hours of talking with my wife michelle and others reading books counselling and with much quiet reflection ive come to a new place a realistic optimist that knows what im good at and what im not and how best to contribute accordingly ive decided to move on from ecos corporation 13 years after establishing it during this time with an extraordinary team of people weve achieved many great things weve helped our clients society and ourselves to learn and get ready for whats coming weve helped great old companies like dupont turn around their giant organisations to face a new direction and be ready weve achieved practical success like helping to build easy being green a start up company that grew to over 200 staff and cut over 4 million tonnes of co2 in just 18 months weve helped to shift the attitudes of leaders in the business community weve stayed focused on our purpose enjoyed ourselves and done some good of course the rest of the team will continue on doing more of this for a long time to come as for me i have new work to do i now understand my highest purpose is to motivate large numbers of people from all walks of life to act we all now need to personally engage in whatever way is appropriate in our circumstances to slow down the crash and to get our society as ready as we can for the challenges ahead so im going to talk write guide and support people to help them do so we must now rise to this challenge this is no longer just an environmental issue how we respond now will decide the future of human civilisation we are the people weve been waiting for there is no one else there is no other time its us and its now kind regards paul gilding download the great disruption letter as a pdf like this like loading",

            "text": "Click here to read the Great Disruption letter as a PDF\n\n17 July 2008\n\nDear friends\n\nAnd so the moment arrives.\n\nIn my first Scream Crash Boom letter of 2005 I forecast the inevitable crash of the global ecosystem. I said the resulting economic and social crises would then drive an investment boom in a new industrial revolution and economic transformation. I thought I was forecasting events a decade or two away. Now, just three years later, look around us. The global economy is trembling under its own weight. We see:\n\nThe ecosystem crash I thought was decades away is now underway and the resulting economic crash is not far behind, perhaps the slide has already begun. As our global market empire eats its way through the natural resources of the planet, stealing from our children, it now overextends, as all empires do before they decline. Desperate for more resources to feed its hungry masses, to shore up the middle class’s wealth, to keep the elites supportive and to protect itself, the system makes promises of continued riches. Promises it can no longer keep. Look how our system responds to oil prices – a response so ridiculous it’s almost funny. We see that our addiction to a non-renewable, polluting resource threatens the economy. Our solution? To try to increase supply and reinforce our dependency.\n\nMadness surrounds us now. This empire has no emperor. There is no senate, no central committee, no board of directors. No-one is in charge and no-one can control what happens next. The system is too complex and intertwined and the momentum is too great. The system is breaking down and we need to prepare for what’s coming. When we look back, 2008 will be a momentous year in human history. Our children and grandchildren will ask us “What was it like? What were you doing when it started to fall apart? Could you see it? What did you think? What did you do?\n\nOften in the middle of something momentous, we can’t see its significance. But for me there is no doubt, 2008 will be the marker – the year when “The Great Disruption” began. We are already seeing the response, though modest. Governments know the costs of inaction on climate change far outweigh the costs of acting. They are rolling out carbon pricing across the developed world. Investors too are waking up to the biggest opportunity of the 21st century – decarbonising and cleaning up the economy. They are pumping billions into what they see as a kind of dot-com boom on steroids with military support. This is all good, but it is all too late to stop the crash.\n\nThat we are at this point should not be a surprise to anyone who looks at the numbers, the science and the behaviour of society throughout history. For decades we’ve been alerted to the risks with clear data on the scientific, demographic and economic trends. True to our nature and our history however, when we don’t want to believe, no amount of data can change our mind.\n\nIn the 1970’s, the infamous Club of Rome report The Limits to Growth, written by my good friend Jorgen Randers and his colleagues1, forecast this situation and explained the simple, obvious, and still true underlying logic. If you keep growing an economy based on the consumption of non-renewable resources at some point they will run out and that model of economic growth will stall. They argued that if we didn’t prepare for this well in advance, major economic and social disruption would result. They gave us 35 years warning. Although it sold many millions of copies, it was vilified by those whose interests it threatened. It was countered, as it still is today, by those techno-optimists who believe that some combination of markets and technology would allow us to respond as the crisis hit, with some relatively minor adjustments. Maybe, if we’d acted 35 years ago, but certainly not now.\n\nMore recently, studies such as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment also raised the alarm. That comprehensive, peer reviewed scientific analysis by 1,300 experts “assessed the consequences of ecosystem change for human well-being”. The final report concluded: “At the heart of this assessment is a stark warning. Human activity is putting such strain on the natural functions of Earth that the ability of the planet’s ecosystems to sustain future generations can no longer be taken for granted”. Many other studies, such as the WWF Living Planet report, have concluded that we are already operating 25% above the planet’s biological capacity to support life on earth.2 Now we forecast a 50% increase in population and a 300% to 400% increase in per capita income using the same models of consumption! Madness.\n\nAll obvious in hindsight. Obvious to Jorgen Randers and his colleagues 35 years ago. Obvious to future generations looking back, who will be mystified by our lack of response given the data available to us.\n\nAnyway, we can wonder at our ability to ignore the obvious and we can analyse our society’s capacity for denial, but it won’t change anything now. It is what it is. The system has spoken, it is in a state of crash.\n\nWe will now begin the challenge of dealing with the crash and then the extraordinarily interesting and exciting process of building a new sustainable economy. Furthermore we will do all this at a speed we can barely imagine sitting here today.\n\nOf course we can’t know with certainty what will occur. On climate change for example, there has never been an event like this in earth’s history where such a massive amount of CO2 has suddenly, in geological timeframes, been released into the atmosphere, let alone into a severely degraded and stressed ecosystem. This carbon was absorbed from the atmosphere over many, many millions of years and laid down securely under the earths crust as oil, gas and coal. This caused temperatures on earth to drop to a level suitable for humans to live, grow food and build this civilisation. Now we’ve taken it out again and dumped it back in the atmosphere. Such a huge CO2 release cannot occur naturally so there’s no precedent from which to understand the impact. So we can’t be sure of the result, but logic and all the indications say it will be ugly.\n\nWhy then, with this uncertainty, am I so convinced that a major crisis is inevitable? I’ve worked on these issues for over 30 years around the world, including at the highest levels in the NGO and corporate sectors. I’ve observed and learnt a great deal about how the system works, how issues develop and how change unfolds. Importantly, I have also learned to trust my intuition and my judgement on this. In summary, the following is why we will see a crash of the ecosystem and the economy before we get serious about change.\n\nSo how will this unfold?\n\nIf you grow an economy or any system up against its limits, it then stops growing and either changes form or breaks down to a simpler system. This applies to a Petri dish of bacteria, a plague of locusts, a species in a forest or to a global economy. It is basic physics and biology. As our system hits its limits, the following pressures will combine, in varied and unpredictable ways, to trigger a system breakdown and a major economic crisis (or series of smaller crises) that will see us slide into a sustained economic downturn and a global emergency lasting decades.\n\nOver she goes.\n\nThe resulting series of economic and political crises will be massive in scale and decades long. They will last this long simply because fixing the causes while dealing with the consequences – a declining economy, political instability and accelerating climate change driven by earlier emissions – will take decades. With this level of crisis and change, the future becomes quite unpredictable and anything is possible, including some very exciting transformational shifts.\n\nWhy do I see this starting now? The system is too complex for analytically based certain predictions. We can’t even predict the oil price, let alone the behaviour of the whole system. However my intuition is screaming at me that now is the time, and the data I see confirms my intuition. If we go back to basics, the two key challenges we face – the availability of cheap resources to feed the economy and the ability of the earth’s ecosystem to absorb our impacts – both have very clear indicators. So as the system hits the wall we should see a significant non-cyclical rise in commodity prices – especially food and energy – and significant evidence of accelerating ecosystem breakdown. These have for several years been my canaries in the “end of growth” coal-mine.\n\nWe see these indicators hitting hard now and the drivers behind them are profound, well embedded and have significant lags in them. So it’s game on. From this point forward, the slide into crisis will define our political and economic world.\n\nThe debate about the benefits of growth are now irrelevant. We will not choose to stop growing. We are taking a system operating past its capacity and driving it faster and harder. No matter how wonderful the system is, the laws of physics and biology still apply. The economy will stop growing and then contract – a depression.\n\nOur whole global political and economic system has been built on incessant growth, so this crisis will strike at the heart of society. Growth is the underpinning policy focus and strategic assumption of all governments, central banks, corporations and investment funds. It is never questioned and anything less leads to intervention to restart it. So when growth stops, things get very difficult. People throw out governments, shareholders throw out Boards and Boards throw out CEOs. So we can expect all that before we face up to reality – we have a system design problem.\n\nIs this all too pessimistic and gloomy? I’m actually by nature a strongly optimistic person. I just look at the numbers and the science and I see it coming.\n\nI want to be clear though that this is not the “end of the world”. It does, however herald an unparalleled era of system stress, economic stagnation and social tension – a global emergency during which we’ll evolve a new economic model and then rebuild. I call it The Great Disruption because it is most likely to be a disruption in society’s evolutionary process, rather than the collapse of civilisation.\n\nThis disruption will drive a transformation of extraordinary speed and scale. It will leave in the dust all other major global changes we’ve faced – those driven by war, technology or globalising markets. It will be an exciting and ultimately positive transformation, with great innovation and change in technology, business and economic models alongside a parallel shift in human development. It could well be, in a non-biological sense, a “great leap forward” for humanity with a move to a higher stage of evolution and consciousness.\n\nSo I find myself soberly accepting the scale of the coming challenges and all the sadness this entails, but still confident we will come through this and rebuild. Why?\n\nHumanity has shown itself to be amazingly resilient. History tells us we are most likely to cope with the crisis, no matter how bad it gets, and that we will grow, change and react in positive ways over time. Yes, we’re resistant to change now but when the crisis hits, its consequences will be so overwhelming that denial will disappear, virtually overnight. Then we’ll begin to see extraordinary and rapid shifts.\n\nYes, some people in this coming crisis will do selfish things, acting out of fear and insecurity given the scale of change. However I believe that more people will do extraordinary, noble and positive things. There are many historical examples of this.\n\nSo I am a realistic optimist. Realistic because I see the crash coming and being ugly, but optimistic because I see it all as “The Great Disruption” – a period through which we’ll pass – rather than a collapse which signifies our end.\n\nMoving forward, we certainly know what we need to do. We need a zero net carbon emitting economy, a society that creates no waste and a distribution of wealth that is more equitable and sees everyone’s basic needs met. We need an economy whose central organising principle is social benefit and human advancement, with wealth creation a tool to that end, not an end in itself.\n\nAnd we know how to get there. Fixing this is not hard, we just haven’t decided to do so yet. We already have leading entrepreneurs, communities, corporations and governments proving the ideas that we can take to scale when we do. As William Gibson said “The future is here. It’s just not widely distributed yet.”\n\nAs well as reinventing our physical infrastructure, we will have to work on our social infrastructure, developing the community and family connections that build the resilience we need to get through the transition. Doing so will also be good for us. As Victor Frankl argued in “Man’s Search for Meaning”, the search for happiness takes us to love, to relationships and to a focus on meaningful achievement.\n\nPersonally I’m preparing for uncertainty and change by focusing on adaptability and building personal resilience. We are all going to have to be nimble and travel light. When I wrote my first Scream Crash Boom letter in 2005 I slipped into despair because the scale of the challenges seemed overwhelming. That took me closer to family, recognising that my resilience came from having a close knit home life, a base from which to face the world. I then realised I needed to look more deeply inside, to truly examine my foibles and my life’s focus. I needed to know what would bring me greater happiness and what was my highest potential purpose (and how to get some of my ego out of the way of getting there!)\n\nThrough endless hours of talking with my wife Michelle and others, reading books, counselling and with much quiet reflection, I’ve come to a new place: a realistic optimist that knows what I’m good at, and what I’m not, and how best to contribute.\n\nAccordingly I’ve decided to move on from Ecos Corporation, 13 years after establishing it. During this time, with an extraordinary team of people, we’ve achieved many great things. We’ve helped our clients, society and ourselves to learn and get ready for what’s coming. We’ve helped great old companies like DuPont turn around their giant organisations to face a new direction and be ready. We’ve achieved practical success like helping to build Easy Being Green, a start up company that grew to over 200 staff and cut over 4 million tonnes of CO2 in just 18 months. We’ve helped to shift the attitudes of leaders in the business community. We’ve stayed focused on our purpose, enjoyed ourselves and done some good. Of course the rest of the team will continue on, doing more of this for a long time to come.\n\nAs for me, I have new work to do. I now understand my highest purpose is to motivate large numbers of people from all walks of life to act. We all now need to personally engage, in whatever way is appropriate in our circumstances, to slow down the crash and to get our society as ready as we can for the challenges ahead. So I’m going to talk, write, guide and support people, to help them do so.\n\nWe must now rise to this challenge. This is no longer just an environmental issue. How we respond now will decide the future of human civilisation. We are the people we’ve been waiting for. There is no one else. There is no other time.\n\nIt’s us and it’s now.\n\nKind regards\n\nPaul Gilding\n\nDownload the Great Disruption letter as a PDF",

the main tree found in these habitats there are some good examples in glen affric and near loch maree to the west however most are in the east especially in the native pinewoods on the north side of the cairngorms and the rspbs abernethy reserve in particular has many bog woodlands what does a bog woodland look like bog woodlands are areas of peaty ground on which the high water table and shortage of nutrients restrict tree growth the unique character of this open habitat is defined by the scattered trees which are gnarled and stunted with twisted branches some of the scots pines can be up to 350 years old but deceptively small in size bog woodland usually forms in areas where the topography is quite varied often a product of irregular glacial deposits resulting in diverse drainage patterns hollows become filled with water allowing bogs to form drier ridges and mounds will support larger pines as well as birch and rowan sorbus aucuparia scrubby willows salix spp sometimes become established in nutrientrich flushes like raised and blanket bogs the ground is covered with layers of sphagnum moss which have built up over centuries the distinction from raised and blanket bogs is that when undisturbed by human activity trees and bog habitats coexist in a relatively stable relationship within a bog woodland a changeable habitat at abernethy ecologists have identified different types of bog with scots pine the first of these are areas with a permanently high water table there is plenty of bog vegetation and heavy seed rain from the surrounding woodland leads to high tree seedling density although there is also high mortality the trees that do survive are often stunted or diseased the second type of bog woodland still has a high water table although it is more variable and the scattered trees grow to a moderate height the third type is slightly drier and has predominantly woodland vegetation with relicts of bog vegetation while the bog woodland community is relatively stable in that the bog and the woodland aspects can coexist for many generations of trees the community does shift between these different types for various reasons these may include periods of drought or fire or changes in the water table which permit tree roots to become more well established when a tree dies the area may shift towards wetter conditions as less water is being drawn out of the ground by the tree the scattered trees in these woodlands add an extra dimension to the bog trees and scrub greatly increase the variety and surface area of habitat available and afford food and cover to a host of invertebrates and birds the shelter they offer influences the microclimate creating conditions of relative warmth and humidity and allowing woodland flora and fauna to thrive alongside those of bogs a rich community of plants bog woodland defies strict categories which makes it very interesting botanically a characteristic bog plant is sphagnum moss sphagnums often form lush carpets of bright green and rich red these mosses are able to hold a large amount of water and have a key role in peat formation the thick spongy hummocks provide a varied microtopography at pitmaduthy moss a bog woodland site in easter ross there are 19 species of sphagnum including s imbricatum and s fuscum which are of national importance the herb layer in bog woodland varies between wetter and drier areas the wettest parts will often have luxuriant plumes of purple moorgrass molinia caerulea other mire species include harestail cotton grass eriophorum vaginatum in drier areas there may be the more usual woodland plants such as ling heather calluna vulgaris blaeberry vaccinium myrtillus and hylocomium moss a fascinating adaptation to the low nutrient levels in wet peaty areas is demonstrated by insectivorous plants such as butterworts pinguicula spp and sundews drosera spp butterwort has a starshaped rosette of yellowish sticky leaves the margins of which roll inwards to trap and digest insects there are three species of sundew in britain all have sticky hairs which trap insects thereby supplementing the plants diet wildlife in wooded bogs many of the mammals and birds are those which we would expect to find in an old pine forest such as the crested tit parus cristatus capercaillie tetrao urogallus and pine marten martes martes red deer cervus elaphus wallow in peat baths to get rid of parasites and flies and to spread their scent over their bodies amphibians such as the common frog rana temporaria also depend on wet habitats pitmaduthy moss is an important breeding area for a number of birds including the osprey pandion haliaetus bog woodlands are rich in invertebrates that quintessential pinewood insect the wood ant formica spp builds its pineneedle covered nests on the drier banks the pools can also be valuable habitat for dragonflies and damselflies among these are the northern emerald somatochlora arctica which is restricted to northwest scotland and southwest ireland and the exquisite and rare northern damselfly coenagrion hastulatum like some more common damselfly species the male northern damselfly has a striking metallic blue body with black markings along its back a dragonfly known as the whitefaced darter leucorrhinia dubia requires acidic bog pools for breeding bordered with rafts of sphagnum in which their larvae grow this species also needs scrub or woodland for roosting and feeding making bog woodland an ideal habitat another aquatic insect a very rare predatory diving beetle known as agabus wasastjernae has been found at abernethy in the pools of water that form beneath the lifted rootplates of fallen pine trees threats to bog woodland bog woodland has suffered similar problems to those faced by blanket bogs and it is easily destroyed by insensitive management peat cutting is one of the most direct threats to have occurred in the past this has been traditionally practiced for centuries in scotland and it can severely disrupt the hydrology of a site although it has a fairly localised effect on vegetation from the 1960s to the early 1980s commercial forestry practices had a huge impact when areas of bog woodland were drained and planted with commercial plantations of sitka spruce picea sitchensis lodgepole pine pinus contorta and scots pine draining drastically alters the plant community while the planted trees dry out the site further and also shade out much of the native vegetation bog woodland is even vulnerable to insensitive management on land nearby drainage planting of exotics which spread their seeds and affect the hydrology or the use of agricultural fertilisers which can drift on to the site and artificially boost tree growth can all adversely affect this wet lownutrient habitat climate change poses a potential threat although it is difficult to predict what the effects might be an increase in rainfall would raise the water table leading to further waterlogging and a reversion from woodland to bog a decrease in rainfall would allow the bogs to dry out and more trees to encroach another unexpected threat has come from overzealous conservation work while in most cases bog habitats need to be kept open to maintain their special interest there have been cases in which trees have been completely removed from areas where true bog woodland had developed the fact that bog woodland is hard to categorise means that up until recently it has been largely overlooked as a habitat type and given a low conservation profile as a result fortunately there are encouraging signs that the situation is changing restoration and protection a number of organisations have worked to reverse the damage to some of our remaining bog woodland habitat the vegetation is often able to recover from disturbance if the hydrology is restored clearly as with much longterm ecological restoration it is not a case of trying to achieve a fixed and static natural state the aim is really to remove the damaging anthropogenic influences and let the habitat recover in an appropriate way raising the water table where the site has dried out has the effect of gradually locking up the nutrients released when the disturbance took place this insures that the allimportant lownutrient levels are reinstated there are a number of ways to restore a higher water level in some cases trees which have been planted and are drying out the bog have been removed blocking the drainage ditches where they have been made is also effective trees for life has been using the same technique to restore blanket bog and alder carr at corrimony and achnashellach respectively trees for lifes work has been contributing to the conservation and restoration of areas of wooded bog in glen affric for example the 50 hectare 125 acre exclosure we funded at coille ruigh includes some wet areas in which small stunted pines are regenerating amongst the sweetsmelling bog myrtle myrica gale there is similar regeneration in the ghuibhais exclosure further west and elsewhere the fact that it naturally develops in many areas of forest undergoing restoration lends weight to the theory that it was once much more widespread our work in surveying and protecting dwarf birch betula nana is also important as this species too forms part of some bog woodland areas in response to the potential threat of climate change it seems that the best course of action is to restore and protect as many different types of bog and bog woodland habitat as possible this should prevent the complete loss of this precious habitat and allow scope for natural change and adjustment the future bog woodland habitat is increasingly being recognised and appreciated for its conservation value and natural beauty under the ec habitats directive it is a priority habitat for protection one urgent measure is to increase our knowledge of the exact distribution of scotlands bog woodlands to ensure that the sites can be monitored and given adequate protection in spite of the potential threats there have been some encouraging successes in

            "text": "Scotland's native forests have many faces. The local climate, altitude, terrain and geology all add to the variety and character of the Caledonian Forest. Native pinewoods, mountain woodland, Atlantic oakwoods and birchwoods are among the garments that once cloaked large areas of Scotland, and now remain in scattered pockets.\n\nBog woodlands are yet another of these garments. With their primeval feel, they may be defined as areas in which woodland and bog (or mire) co-exist in a relatively stable relationship. They highlight the way in which Nature often blends the boundaries between one habitat and another.\n\nBog woodland can be found in many parts of the boreal and temperate zones, for example on the west coast of Canada. Parts of Scandinavia have quite extensive areas of bog woodland, and it also occurs in Germany, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and some of the foothills of the Alps.\n\nIn contrast, it is rare in the UK: it is estimated that there are only around 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) left, although it was once much more widespread. There are fragments in various parts of the country including some birch (Betula spp.) bog woodland in the New Forest, in Hampshire, and a number of sites in Ireland.\n\nIn Scotland, where Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is the main tree found in these habitats, there are some good examples in Glen Affric and near Loch Maree to the west. However, most are in the east, especially in the native pinewoods on the north side of the Cairngorms and the RSPB's Abernethy Reserve in particular has many bog woodlands.\n\nBog woodlands are areas of peaty ground on which the high water table and shortage of nutrients restrict tree growth. The unique character of this open habitat is defined by the scattered trees which are gnarled and stunted, with twisted branches. Some of the Scots pines can be up to 350 years old, but deceptively small in size.\n\nBog woodland usually forms in areas where the topography is quite varied, often a product of irregular glacial deposits resulting in diverse drainage patterns. Hollows become filled with water, allowing bogs to form. Drier ridges and mounds will support larger pines, as well as birch and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia). Scrubby willows (Salix spp.) sometimes become established in nutrient-rich flushes.\n\nLike raised and blanket bogs, the ground is covered with layers of Sphagnum moss which have built up over centuries. The distinction from raised and blanket bogs is that when undisturbed by human activity, trees and bog habitats co-exist in a relatively stable relationship within a bog woodland.\n\nAt Abernethy, ecologists have identified different types of bog with Scots pine. The first of these are areas with a permanently high water table. There is plenty of bog vegetation, and heavy seed rain from the surrounding woodland leads to high tree seedling density, although there is also high mortality. The trees that do survive are often stunted or diseased. The second type of bog woodland still has a high water table, although it is more variable, and the scattered trees grow to a moderate height.

The wettest parts will often have luxuriant plumes of purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea). Other mire species include hare's-tail cotton grass (Eriophorum vaginatum). In drier areas there may be the more usual woodland plants, such as ling heather (Calluna vulgaris), blaeberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and Hylocomium moss.\n\nA fascinating adaptation to the low nutrient levels in wet, peaty areas is demonstrated by insectivorous plants such as butterworts (Pinguicula spp.) and sundews (Drosera spp.). Butterwort has a star-shaped rosette of yellowish, sticky leaves, the margins of which roll inwards to trap and digest insects.

Amphibians such as the common frog (Rana temporaria) also depend on wet habitats. Pitmaduthy Moss is an important breeding area for a number of birds, including the osprey (Pandion haliaetus).\n\nBog woodlands are rich in invertebrates. That quintessential pinewood insect, the wood ant (Formica spp.) builds its pine-needle covered nests on the drier banks. The pools can also be valuable habitat for dragonflies and damselflies. Among these are the northern emerald (Somatochlora arctica) - which is restricted to north-west Scotland and south-west Ireland - and the exquisite, and rare, northern damselfly (Coenagrion hastulatum). Like some more common damselfly species, the male northern damselfly has a striking metallic blue body, with black markings along its back. A dragonfly known as the white-faced darter (Leucorrhinia dubia) requires acidic bog pools for breeding, bordered with rafts of Sphagnum in which their larvae grow.

Raising the water table where the site has dried out has the effect of gradually locking up the nutrients released when the disturbance took place. This insures that the all-important low-nutrient levels are reinstated.\n\nThere are a number of ways to restore a higher water level. In some cases trees which have been planted and are drying out the bog have been removed. Blocking the drainage ditches, where they have been made, is also effective (Trees for Life has been using the same technique to restore blanket bog and alder carr at Corrimony and Achnashellach respectively).\n\nTrees for Life's work has been contributing to the conservation and restoration of areas of wooded bog.

connect the dots to climate change because theyre not climate science experts and theyre worried that doing so will draw the ire of antiscience tea party activists but when reporters ignore reality

its like in the early 2000s we dropped off a cliff laughing gulls with their black heads and loud calls of ha ha ha are among the most recognizable shorebirds historically they nested in huge numbers in the marshes of the lagoons and barrier islands on the atlantic side of the eastern shore but rising sea level has led to periodic flooding that drowns chicks and wipes out nests watts said you reach a tipping point he said thats when theyre washed out so frequently that they cant hatch chicks then those colonies are lost this is just another example of how the climate and sea level are changing and the response to that watts said behind cobb island theres an entire complex of marsh islands that are referred to collectively as gull marsh its a pretty long string a mile or so that

new crises solely in hopes of making president obama look bad congressional republicans wont support any legislation that gives president obama any credit for solving the climate crisis and in fact if the climate crisis did not exist its not hard to imagine the house gop gleefully passing bills trying to create one the only hope is that either democrats can retake the house or that congressional

climate action poll after poll shows anywhere from 30 to 50 of republican voters say climate change is happening and we should do something about it but only a handful of congressional republicans advocate climate action why arent congressional republicans representing their own voters on climate change these articles ignore the disparity altogether no one likes a carbon tax better than carbon limits both articles argue that a revenueneutral carbon tax is superior to environmental protection agency limits on carbon pollution citing conservative economists who say thats the most virtuous way to go the problem is that among noneconomists americans across party lines agree taxes are bad and environmental protection agency regulations are good even if it was popular as grists david roberts has detailed a carbon tax is trickier than you think why is inaction untenable neither article lays out the scientific urgency of addressing climate change for example the number of american communities that inaction will literally put underwater neither article lays out the political urgency for example that young voters think republican climate denial is ignorant outoftouch and crazy both articles focus on economic solutions which again is compelling to economists but wont win you many arguments at a neighborhood picnic a much stronger case was made by a young conservative congressional staffer who wrote under a pen name for fear of losing his job for speaking the truth about the scientific political urgency of climate action much like with immigration reform congressional republicans have painted themselves into a political corner theyre screwed in the shortterm because theyve opposed sensible solutions for so long theyll get none of the political credit for their passage but that would leave them screwed in the longterm as the ignoramus party wouldnt you rather take the shortterm hit and move on to topics that you can win on id rather these articles

Don't Ask Virginian-Pilot by: TheGreenMiles When reporters ignore climate change in their stories, they end up sounding like they're blaming the supernatural for events easily connected to climate change. I'm late in getting to this, but take this Hampton Roads Virginian-Pilot story from January on a sharp decline in catch of striped bass: They say there are a handful of elements that have lowered the ocean take the past two years. Weather has been the biggest reason. Warmer starts to the past two winters have caused many rockfish to stay in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay, or up the coast around upper Maryland and New Jersey. [...] \"It's been the strangest year,\" said Rob O'Reilly, chief of fisheries management for the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. \"The weather has been so screwy that some fish haven't moved south like they usually do, and the ones that have positioned themselves offshore.\" Reporters are often reluctant to connect the dots to climate change because they're not climate science experts and they're worried that doing so will draw the ire of anti-science Tea Party activists. But when reporters ignore reality, they leave their audience absolutely baffled. Strange! Screwy! Don't ask me for answers, you're on your own! And then newspapers wonder why half of their audience has stopped paying $15 a month for a subscription. If you have to go find the truth yourself anyway, might as well do it for free on the internet.

I am as guilty as anyone of spending more time debating climate denial trolls than actually crafting solutions, lobbying to get them passed and working to ensure they are adopted.  This unproductive situation is the result of the effective diversionary tactic developed and executed by the Koch brothers, Exxon Mobil and the other fossil fuel titans who have spent millions to sow doubt about climate change through a huge network of organizations, individuals, websites and blogs.   Their endless factoids and talking points would only make sense if pretty much the entire global scientific establishment were engaged in the biggest conspiracy that the world has ever known.  Which is, quite simply, science fiction.   As long as we remain stuck on this phony debate over settled science, however, we remain one step away from working to actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent the climate change that is already happening from turning truly catastrophic. There's More... :: (3 Comments, 713 words in story)\n\nYes, Virginia, There is an Environment by: kindler Think about it: 2013 started with the Democratic leader of the Virginia Senate, Dick Saslaw, proclaiming his support for uranium mining here with the argument that, centuries into the future, when radioactive waste will remain a hazard, \"I'm not going to be here...I can't ban something because of something that might happen 500 or 1,000 years from now.\" 2013 ends with Virginia Uranium Inc. currently giving up the fight to overturn the state uranium mining ban. What's behind this extraordinary turnaround -- and what does it signal about where Virginia is headed?  Is the Commonwealth, years behind national trends on energy, the environment and sustainability, about to catch up? That will depend on those of us who care about these issues raising our voices and holding public officials' feet to the fire.  But there's increasing evidence that we -- finally, finally! -- have the wind at our backs. Consider these factual morsels: *For all that the left loves to bash Terry McAuliffe, the fact is that he ran and won on progressive positions -- including on energy and climate change.  He skillfully took advantage of Ken Cuccinelli's extremist attack on Professor Michael Mann by campaigning with Mann and proclaiming that we must respect scientists and their findings if we want to move Virginia forward.

Historically, they nested in huge numbers in the marshes of the lagoons and barrier islands on the Atlantic side of the Eastern Shore. But rising sea level has led to periodic flooding that drowns chicks and wipes out nests, Watts said. \"You reach a tipping point,\" he said. \"That's when they're washed out so frequently that they can't hatch chicks. Then those colonies are lost.\" [...] \"This is just another example of how the climate and sea level are changing, and the response to that,\" Watts said. \"Behind Cobb Island, there's an entire complex of marsh islands that are referred to collectively as Gull Marsh. It's a pretty long string, a mile or so. That used to be a real gull factory there. It is no longer.\" It's just one example of birds threatened by climate change. Similar stories can be found up & down the Atlantic Coast, from Maine's threatened puffins to the jeopardized MacGillivray's seaside sparrow in the Carolinas and Florida. Tell the Environmental Protection Agency you support strong new limits on climate-disrupting industrial carbon pollution.

Marco Rubio (R-FL) now opposes his own immigration bill. It's not just that today's Republican Party rejects all available solutions to all available problems because they don't want President Obama to get any credit for solving any problems. They're willing to create entirely new crises solely in hopes of making President Obama look bad. Congressional Republicans won't support any legislation that gives President Obama any credit for solving the climate crisis, and in fact if the climate crisis did not exist, it's not hard to imagine the House GOP gleefully passing bills trying to create one. The only hope is that either Democrats can re-take the House or that Congressional Republicans get more interested in problem-solving - as Wayne Gretzky once said, skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been. Climate activists should be planning and power building now for that moment when it comes, hopefully in 2014 or 2016.

Times Bans Climate Deniers - When Will the Rest of the Media Follow Suit? by: kindler Cross-posted at Daily Kos This past week, the Los Angeles Times took a little-noticed step that could have a profound impact on your children's and grandchildren's future: it decided to ban climate change deniers from its pages.  If this step catches on and spreads to other media outlets, it could finally lead us away from the distraction of the phony, manufactured \"debate\" over the existence and causes of the global climate disruption and actually get down to the real work of confronting this challenge.   Editor Paul Thorton was admirably simple and direct on this point: [W]hen deciding which letters should run among hundreds on such weighty matters as climate change, I must rely on the experts -- in other words, those scientists with advanced degrees who undertake tedious research and rigorous peer review. And those scientists have provided ample evidence that human activity is indeed linked to climate change. Just last month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- a body made up of the world's top climate scientists -- said it was 95% certain that we fossil-fuel-burning humans are driving global warming. The debate right now isn't whether this evidence exists (clearly, it does) but what this evidence means for us. Simply put, I do my best to keep errors of fact off the letters page; when one does run, a correction is published. Saying \"there's no sign humans have caused climate change\" is not stating an opinion, it's asserting a factual inaccuracy.  [Emphasis added] There's More... :: (1 Comments, 732 words in story)\n\nTerry McAuliffe's Bold Move on Climate by: kindler For any progressives out there still grumbling that Terry McAuliffe is not your type of Democrat, it's time to pay attention to the actual positions the man is running on.  Health care, education, transportation, jobs and economic development -- and yes, energy and the environment.   Julie Carey of NBC 4 in Washington reported yesterday that Terry McAuliffe has now come out in support of President Obama's proposed climate change rules.  This is a courageous move, and a big deal that ought to make more those who care about these issues get off their butts and hit the streets to help Terry beat world-class climate denial conspiracy theorist Ken Cuccinelli.   Needless to say, Cuccinelli's right wing allies are tripping all over each other to sputter nonsense in response about a \"war on coal.\"  Lowell has done such a good job demolishing this phony talking point that I beg you to read his posts here and here and I'll simply provide the headlines: - Cheap natural gas is what's destroying coal in the marketplace right now -- you know, that \"free market\" that conservatives like to talk about, except when it's in their political interest to oppose it?   There's More... :: (2 Comments, 394 words in story)\n\nRemember When the Coal Industry Loved \"Clean Coal\"? by: TheGreenMiles The Environmental Protection Agency is unveiling carbon pollution limits for new power plants today. The coal industry is screaming bloody murder that no one could possibly expect new coal-fired power plants to implement carbon pollution-cutting technology, but it was only a few years ago that Big Coal was promising Americans it could do exactly that. The rules will require that coal-fired power plants stop treating our skies like an open carbon sewer. While the rules are only being made public today, the coal industry has spent all week promising to send an army of corporate lawyers to fight the pollution restrictions: Utility companies with large coal fleets already are preparing to challenge the rule, if it is finalized, on the grounds that the agency is requiring pollution controls that have not yet been \"adequately demonstrated\" in the marketplace. Joseph Stanko, head of government relations for the law firm Hunton & Williams, said the EPA's reliance on \"federally funded demonstration projects\" as the base for its new standard \"is illegal, it doesn't 'adequately demonstrate' technology for normal use.\" Remember the coal industry was buying billboards promising us coal could be \"clean and green with new technologies\"?

At present, the U.S. participates in one of the world's most egregious market distortions by keeping the costs of energy down in the country.

            "text": "We've all heard about the ongoing recent political protests in Russia, from Pussy Riot's trial to activists taking the streets shouting \"down with Putin!\". But last weekend the infamous Dima Yakovlev law, which has banned adoptions of Russian orphans by Americans, has led to something slightly different: the emergence of social protest.\n\nThe satirist Dmitry Bykov recently wrote in an otherwise darkly humorous essay that \"fears about [Putin's possible departure] are understandable, because after Putin, we won't get to take him to task for anything, we will have to take ourselves to task – and nobody is ready for that responsibility\". And it seems that many people who attend political protests, or even lead them, may not be ready for any kind of major responsibility. That's because Russia has always had a centralised power model, even in the so-called wild 1990s.\n\nBut Sunday's protest march, referred to as the March Against the Jerks (the jerks being the politicians who bent to the Kremlin's will and passed the adoption law), was different. It was emotional, yes, but it was also more down-to-earth: it centred on the basic idea that the immediate needs of orphaned children are more important than politics.\n\nThe march was criticised for being \"pro-American\" or even \"pro-selling-our-children-to-the-evil-Americans,\" but then again, I was there and didn't see any fervent Uncle Sam worshippers. In fact, while shooting a video there with my colleague, I felt self-conscious about speaking loudly in my obviously American English. Who knows? We might have been accused of being provocateurs or \"American pigs\", as we were at a previous protest.\n\nStill, this march had a friendlier atmosphere. The people who were marching were debating ethics, for one thing. Last autumn, sociologist and lapsed United Russia member Olga Kryshtanovskaya said that what Russia really needs right now are \"lofty ideals\", because the idea that \"money decides everything\" has become tiresome for everyone. I see no better representation of Russia's emerging ethical struggle than the debate over the adoption law.\n\nThe march featured no stage and no impassioned speeches from the leaders of the protest movement, and this was a good thing. The problem of finding new homes for orphans in Russia will not be solved by shouting slogans. This is an issue that adoption experts and adoptive parents can speak about with the most authority – and they are not the people who can or should be climbing a stage to fire up a crowd. And while I also believe that banning adoptions by Americans is unethical (this is personal for me – as an American, I am also now banned from adopting, and as a young mother, I find something seriously wrong with this), I also believe that Russia's orphan problem can be solved by making changes that must happen on a local level, and not as the result of a top-down decree. There must be viable social programmes, for one thing (and the government appears to be moving in that direction, though only time will tell how successful they will be). Society must simply evolve, become better, become – to borrow Kryshtanovskaya's word – \"loftier\". It's the only way.\n\nSunday's march goes back to the notion that Russia needs an evolution, as opposed to a revolution. Of course, some people will say that the former is not possible without the latter. I'm not sure about that. For a society as painfully divided as Russia's, the principle of \"do no harm\" is most crucial. Particularly when we're talking about protecting said society's most fragile members – its orphans.",

Hurricane Katrina Page history last edited by Mr Gore ascribed Hurricane Katrina to global warming, but there was \"insufficient evidence to show that\" Now I'm going to show you, recently released, the actual ocean temperature. Of course when the oceans get warmer, that causes stronger storms. We have seen in the last couple of years, a lot of big hurricanes. Hurricanes Jean, Francis and Ivan were among them. In the same year we had that string of big hurricanes; we also set an all time record for tornadoes in the United States. Japan again didn't get as much attention in our news media, but they set an all time record for typhoons. The previous record was seven. Here are all ten of the ones they had in 2004. The science textbooks that have to be re-written because they say it is impossible to have a hurricane in the South Atlantic. It was the same year that the first one that ever hit Brazil. The summer of 2005 is one for the books. The first one was Emily that socked into Yucatan. Then Hurricane Dennis came along and it did a lot of damage, including to the oil industry. This is the largest oil platform in the world after Dennis went through. This one was driven into the bridge at Mobile. And then of course came Katrina. It is worth remembering that when it hit Florida it was a Category 1, but it killed a lot of people and caused billions of dollars worth of damage. And then, what happened? Before it hit New Orleans, it went over warmer water. As the water temperature increases, the wind velocity increases and the moisture content increases. And you'll see Hurricane Katrina form over Florida. And then as it comes into the Gulf over warm water it becomes stronger and stronger and stronger. Look at that Hurricane's eye. And of course the consequences were so horrendous; there are no words to describe it. Sirens, background music, Mayor Ray Nagin. The water is up to my neck. I don't think I'm going to make it. How in god's name could that happen here? There had been warnings that hurricanes would get stronger. There were warnings that this hurricane, days before it hit, would breach the levies and cause the kind of damage that it ultimately did cause. And one question that we, as a people, need to decide is how we react when we hear warnings from the leading scientists in the world. There was another storm in the 1930's of a different kind, a horrible unprecedented storm in continental Europe. Winston Churchill warned the people of England that it was different from anything that had ever happened before, and they had to get ready for it. A lot of people did not want to believe it and he got real impatient with all the dithering. He said this: \"The era of procrastination, of half measures, of soothing, and baffling expedience of delays is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.\" Making mistakes in generations and centuries past would have consequences that we could overcome. We don't have that luxury anymore. We didn't ask for it, but here it is. In scene 12 Hurricane Katrina and the consequent devastation in New Orleans is ascribed to global warming. It is common ground that there is insufficient evidence to show that. 3. There is insufficient evidence to establish clearly that particular one-off weather events, such as Hurricane Katrina, are attributable to climate change. However, the IPCC concludes that it is likely that there has been an increase in intense tropical cyclone activity in some regions and more likely than not that humans have contributed to this            Gore seems to me to make no such claim. He is making the obvious analogy to missed warnings, and pointing out the relationship of storm strength to water temperatures, both valid points I think.

the debate whats most amazing about the ideological support for an attack on iran is how we have not even begun to debate how and why we went into iraq during the 1970s the united states went through

subjects did not see the gorilla by concentrating on what they are told to look at they are blind to the gorilla the sacred cows or taboos are the gorillas our media politicians and academics tell us to watch the ball bombings surges draw downs new generals old generals what obama says what limbaugh says what biden says what fox says what cnn says but what we should focus on is what they dont say what they dont mention is precisely the gorilla and the gorilla in this case is the special relationship with israel when it is brought up we are told to focus on another ball as soon as someone asks the very simple question why are we supporting israel what do we get out of it they are told to look at the ball called antisemitism the real debate the logical debate is off limits that is why we cant really talk about why we went into iraq in the first place when anyone begins to connect the dots neocons aipac israel the project for a new america it becomes clear that this war was a gross manipulation of the fear caused by 911 in an effort to somehow marry israels foreign policy goals with americas but no major media outlet ever broaches the taboo from fox to cnn from the new york times to the new republic the new yorker to the weekly standard obama to palin all agree america must have a special relationship with israel our foreign policy is obliged to ensure the safety and well being of the jewish state see the end of the republic the real problem for the republic is not even what our foreign policy is the real cancer is that there is no debate at all about its single most important premise ahmadinejad admadinejad is certainly an unsavory character and his holocaust denying the political repression hangings and antisemitic rants are pitiful and abhorrent but then again the united states has no moral footing to question irans democratic credentials after the cia orchestrated a coup to overthrow the the democraticallyelected government of iranian prime minister mohammad mosaddegh in 1953 the western media has made much of the opposition movement to ahmadinejad but few have really investigated who won the elections there though widely ignored by the major american news media a recent study by the program on international policy attitudes pipa at the university of maryland found little evidence to support allegations of fraud nor to conclude that most iranians view president ahmadinejad as illegitimate ipa analyzed multiple polls of the iranian public from three different sources including some before the june 12 2009 election and some afterwards the study found that in all the polls a majority said they planned to vote for ahmadinejad or had voted for him the numbers ranged from 52 to 57 percent just before the election to 55 to 66 percent after the election what is the threat to the united states if iran gets a nuclear weapon the most pessimistic predictions for a iran to have a fully operational weapon are at least three years a deal was worked out between turkey brasil and iran in which to erdogan and lula da silva convinced ahmadinejad to agree a deal originally proposed by the obama administration to ship 2640 pounds of irans lowenriched uranium to turkey in exchange for higherenriched uranium that could only be used for peaceful medical uses when the deal was announced washington and the neocon media were not happy friedman in the new york times i confess that when i first saw the may 17 picture of irans president mahmoud ahmadinejad joining his brazilian counterpart luiz inácio lula da silva and the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan with raised arms — after their signing of a putative deal to defuse the crisis over irans nuclear weapons program — all i could think of was is there anything uglier than watching democrats sell out other democrats to a holocaustdenying votestealing iranian thug just to tweak the us and show that they too can play at the big power table no thats about as ugly as it gets i wonder if mr friedman has looked at any photographs from iraq lately washington also balked hillary clinton every step of the way has demonstrated clearly to the world that iran is not participating in the international arena in the way that we had asked them to do and that they continued to pursue their nuclear program so what is the real agenda a negotiated deal or regime change the similarities to iraq are striking but no alarms are going off why the most important discussion should be what is the threat to the united states if iran gets a nuclear weapon three years from now israels nukes israel has close to 100 nuclear weapons stored at its dimona facility yet no american president has ever publicly mentioned israels nuclear weapons at the 2010 review conference of the parties to the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons the final statement criticized israel for not joining the non proliferation treaty the double standard rose its ugly head obamas statement at the close of the treaty the united states has long supported such a nuclearfree middle east zone although our view is that a comprehensive and durable peace in the region and full compliance by all regional states with their arms control and nonproliferation obligations are essential precursors for its establishment we strongly oppose efforts to single out israel and will oppose actions that jeopardize israels national security but israel is different they would never proliferate nuclear weapons they are americas best friend the only democracy in the middle east well they are a democracy if you werent born in what is now israel as a palestinian the guardian reported recently on how declassified apartheid era documents show that israel tried to sell nuclear weapons to south africa secret south african documents reveal that israel offered to sell nuclear warheads to the apartheid regime providing the first official documentary evidence of the states possession of nuclear weapons interesting to see the spin the story was given in the new york times israel denies it offered south africa warheads jerusalem — the office of israels president shimon peres strongly denied monday that mr peres as israels defense minister offered to sell nuclear warheads to south africa in 1975 as reported by the guardian hard to make that case that iran is the evil one if israel is proliferating nuclear weapons to apartheid regimes the real debate instead of debating the pros and cons of another war against a country that has done us no harm nor has said it will we should focus on why we are so entangled in the middle east in the first place is it oil less than 17 of us oil imports come from the middle east and only saudi arabia represents an important part of our oil needs crude oil imports top 15 countries thousand barrels per day country may10 canada 1997 mexico 1290 saudi arabia 1093 venezuela 1011 nigeria 1004 angola 423 iraq 394 russia 358 algeria 352 brazil 312 colombia 295 kuwait 219 ecuador 160 congo brazzaville 89 norway 78 finding new sources for 17 of our imported oil through diplomacy alternative energies and improved efficiency seems like a much more practical strategy than bringing democracy to the middle east the other argument is that israel is americas best ally the only democracy in the middle east american foreign policy has never put a big premium on democracy ie chile iran guatemala cuba united states foreign policy always has been about its own interests israels military is ranked 11th in the world yet they are ranked 40th in gdp so it is safe to say they are armed to the teeth as well as having a massive nuclear arsenal it is strange to think that israel receives around 3 billion in us aid per year when they have a per capita gdp of around 30000 almost the same as italy could you imagine the uproar if nancy pelosi and rudy guliani somehow finagled sending italy 3 billion a year in aid israel does not need american foreign aid or military aid they are a wealthy country with an extremely potent military so why does the us spend so much of its foreign policy capital on israel the us population is less the 2 jewish the vast majority of which have no roots in israel the two main culprits are aipac and the neocons the power of aipac is frightening in the latest spat between jerusalem and washington aipac wrote a letter implicitly rebuking the obama administration for its confrontational stance toward israel it was signed by 76 senators 33 democrats who normally cant agree on the time of day and the us media is incapable of openly questioning the special relationship no major newspaper or media outlet has a columnist who consistently calls for an end to us support for israel and the beginning of new neutral relationship as a nation the us must ask itself what it gets in return for fighting the war in iraq and using its foreign policy capital on issues like iran instead of focusing on latin america eastern europe and asia the bottom line is not about being a zionist or antizionist if american zionists want to send their money to israel and send the sons and daughters to fight for israel that is their right but when a small group manipulates american media and foreign policy so that american troops kill and our killed to carry out a zionist agenda then there is a problem just as helen thomas and octavia nasr where run out of their jobs for the great damage their words caused its time voices where raised calling for the same treatment for the war mongers at the new york times the washington post the weekly standard the atlantic and commentary the same can be said for aipac an amazingly frank example of the power the israeli government has over our foreign policy came in early 2009 as the israeli attack on gaza raged the us was going to vote along with the other members of the un security council for a a cease fire resolution that condelezza rice had helped draft in a very candid speech isreali prime minister ehud olmert described what happened next as reported in the new york times in the night between thursday and friday when the secretary of state wanted to lead the vote on a ceasefire at the security council we did not want her to vote in favour mr olmert said i said get me president bush on the phone they said he was in the middle of giving a speech in philadelphia i said i didnt care i need to talk to him now he got off the podium and spoke to me i told him the united states could not vote in favour it can not vote in favour of such a resolution he immediately called the secretary of state and told her not to vote in favour she was left pretty embarrassed she abstained the only abstention on the security council its almost inconcievable to imagine the uproar if sarkozy tony blair or any other ally ever said this to the press it would be world news fodder for columnists politicians and even comics amazingly this is not a well known or even talked about event logic seems to have been lost those who shout the truth are branded as mad and those who cry for more madness are considered sane much madness is divinest sense to a discerning eye much sense the starkest madness t is the majority in this as all prevails assent and you are sane demur—you re straightway dangerous and handled with a chain emily dickinson",

someone years ago the archdiocese released a statement that included a quote from the archbishop we are committed to the protection of children and young people in our parishes and institutions such a statement is undoubtedly true of course the church is committed to protecting children what organization says it isnt committed to protecting children it also does not say anything about the unprecedented measures that the church has taken in the past to address abuse in the church and what it will do to get to the bottom of this particular case the archdioceses full press statement did indeed outline the many measures that it has taken to address abuse as well as what it will do to get to the bottom of the new case before it now however newspapers rarely reprint full press releases

board concludes that a priest has been falsely accused it should say so and say it strongly the church can do a lot better than simply saying a claim was unsubstantiated upon returning a priest to

            "text": "CWR Archive:  Media US Bishops Must Master the Sound Bite Going on the media offensive and strengthening public relations will protect children and educate the public. David F. Pierre, Jr.\n\n Bishop R. Daniel Conlon reads a newspaper prior to the start of a US bishops' meeting in November 2007. (CNS photo/Nancy Wiechec) Last August in Omaha, Bishop Daniel Conlon of Joliet, Illinois delivered a speech entitled, “Help for Bishops in Rebuilding Trust.” The talk was designed to encourage the lay faithful in speaking up about all of the progress that the Catholic Church has made in providing safe environments for children and protecting kids in light of the abuse scandals. “You may be in a position to be pastoral assistants to bishops in binding up the Church’s wounds and restoring trust. I hope God calls you to that task and equips you for it,” Bishop Conlon said. However, more than halfway through his speech, in which he pointed out the urgent need for lay people to spread the Church’s message, Bishop Conlon quipped that the “credibility” of bishops was “shredded” when it came to the issue of child sex abuse. Media outlets immediately jumped all over the opportunity to report that a Catholic bishop had announced that the bishops’ credibility was “shredded.” The bishop’s remark had all the traits of a terrific headline; “R. Daniel Conlon, Catholic Bishop, Says Church’s Credibility On Sex Abuse Is ‘Shredded’” read the headline on David Gibson’s report for Religion News Service. Never mind that the words were frequently taken out of their original contextConlon’s larger point was about empowering lay people to fulfill the Church’s role of reaching out to victims and promoting a message of healing. The enemies of the Church had all of the ammunition it needed, and the damage was done. The importance of the sound bite Conlon’s episode serves as an invaluable lesson to the Church when it comes to making speeches, issuing off-handed remarks, composing articles, and dealing with the media. We live in a culture of the sound bite, and the enemies of the Church are ready to seize on this. In a sound-bite culture, context and honesty are easily thrown aside. Bishops and spokespeople need to understand that many in the media are always seeking out anything negative with which to hammer the Catholic Church. Words must be chosen extremely carefully. The Church’s enemies don’t give a rip about context or if you “meant something else.” Many enemies of the Church have become masters of the sound bite. David Clohessy, the national director of the anti-Catholic group SNAP (Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests) continually rails against bishops who allegedly “ignore, conceal, and enable heinous child sex crimes.” The words make a great sound bite; they look good, and they catch people’s attention. Journalists love this, and many could not care less what the actual facts are. Catholic officials and diocesan spokespeople need to utilize strong, concise, and engaging sound bites. Such a strategy will not only fortify the Church’s struggling public relations, but it will also educate the public about the unrivaled advances it has taken to protect kids. A time to strengthen the message Indeed, the last two decades have been dark days for the Catholic Church as stories of wretched abuse by criminal priests have wreaked immeasurable damage to innocent victims. We must never forget that. Victims must take priority in actions by the Church. However, as the Catholic Church in the United States has become nothing less than a punching bag in the media, the time has come for bishops and Church spokespeople to become bolder and more media savvy. This includes getting rid of feeble-sounding and politically correct platitudes that do nothing but portray the Church as a weak and easy target. When an archdiocese recently removed a priest from ministry over an allegation that he had abused someone years ago, the archdiocese released a statement that included a quote from the archbishop: “We are committed to the protection of children and young people in our parishes and institutions.” Such a statement is undoubtedly true; of course the Church is committed to protecting children. What organization says it isn’t committed to protecting children? It also does not say anything about the unprecedented measures that the Church has taken in the past to address abuse in the Church and what it will do to get to the bottom of this particular case. The archdiocese’s full press statement did indeed outline the many measures that it has taken to address abuse, as well as what it will do to get to the bottom of the new case before it now. However, newspapers rarely reprint full press releases in their articles. Yet they do like to include quotations from Church leaders and spokespeople. Therefore, upon removing accused priests from ministry, dioceses should have their leaders and spokespeople directly address the efforts they have made to combat abuse. For example: “No other organization has accomplished more in confronting the issue of child abuse in its institution than the Catholic Church,” said Bishop X. “In accordance with our national policy, this diocese will have our team of professional investigators and our lay review board work to get to the truth of this serious allegation.” Much of the public is still unaware of the unprecedented measures that the Church has taken to tackle the scourge of child abuse: annual audits, diocesan review boards, intensified employee screenings, abuse awareness trainings, and tens of millions of dollars spent on therapy for victims. Stronger statements enable the Church to get the word out about what it has done. And in those instances when dioceses return falsely accused priests to ministry, the Church should purge the weak-sounding word “unsubstantiated” from its vocabulary. Investigations into abuse claims often take years, and if a diocesan review board concludes that a priest has been falsely accused, it should say so, and say it strongly. The Church can do a lot better than simply saying a claim was “unsubstantiated.” Upon returning a priest to ministry, a diocese could announce: Our lay review board, composed of psychologists, victims, and child welfare advocates, exhaustively reviewed this allegation and found no reason to conclude that the accusation was true. Bogus accusations are a sad reality of today’s culture. Fr. [X]’s reputation has been greatly damaged, and we are going to work to restore his reputation the best we can. Many may ask: But won’t audacious statements from the Church upset groups like SNAP and their Church-suing lawyers? The answer: Of course they will. But these same people will complain about the Church no matter what it does. The Church needs to understand this. Enemies of the Church, including those in the media, will always falsely accuse the Church of “attacking” and “belittling” victims. It’s simply what they do. Unfortunately, no matter what the Church does, this will never change. When returning a falsely accused priest to ministry, the Church can strengthen its position by making a statement along these lines: The diocese puts children’s safety first. We do not let lawyers and professional Church critics dictate our decisions. The only reason we return an accused priest to ministry is because our lay member review board found no evidence at all that any abuse took place. Period. A great example of what to do Fortunately, there are encouraging signs that some diocesan spokespeople are taking a stronger initiative with enemies of the Church and the media. Just last week, media outlets in the Boston area made the astonishing claim that a parental form for a religious education program at a parish in the Diocese of Fall River, Massachusetts was designed to absolve the Church from future child abuse claims. Even though at least one parent noted that the form was “just like any other form that you have to sign” these days, high-profile contingency lawyer Mitchell Garabedian, who has successfully sued the Church for millions of dollars, used the incident to blast the Church in the media again. A couple days later, SNAP announced a press conference outside the Fall River Chancery Office. Instead of sitting quietly inside while SNAP members castigated the Church, Fall River diocesan spokesperson John Kearns went outside and confronted the two leaders in front of the media. When the pair from SNAP made a false statement about the nature of the formwhich was never distributed diocesan-wide and wasn’t intended to protect the parish or diocese from accusations of sex abuseKearns refuted the claim. The SNAP representatives did not dispute his explanation. “I wish you had called me,” Kearns said to the two SNAP representatives, as Fall River’s Herald News reported. Kearns should be commended, as he provides an excellent example of how diocesan spokespeople and other Church officials can strengthen the public relations of the Church by going on the offensive. When unfair or false stories are being perpetuated, diocesan spokespeople need to be there to repudiate the falsehoods and mischaracterizations. How will this benefit the Church? As Church officials and diocesan spokespeople become more vocal, Catholics and the rest of the public will become more aware of the exceptional efforts that the Church is making in creating safe environments for children.

proposal to cut emissions from power plants this weeks historic announcement from the epa gave us our answer no time at all and in one case the criticism came before the proposal was even issued thats what the us chamber of commerce decided to do putting out a datadriven study on the effects of epas proposal days before it was released using the wrong data the chamber may have antiregulation propaganda down to a science but their doomandgloom should still follow the laws of timeandspace their claims earned them a rating of four pinnochios from washington post s factcheckers the head of the chamber which is heavily supported by coal and oil companies said that these new epa standards for power plants would have a profound effect on the economy on businesses and on families i agree because time and time again when america sets strong environmental safeguards the effects are profound millions of jobs are created as our innovative spirits rise to the challenge millions of americans are healthier our air is cleaner our water safer of course none of this is new in 2009 congressman henry waxman and i built a formidable collation that included the utility industry unions consumer and faithbased groups and many others to pass the waxmanmarkey climate legislation through the us house of representatives but the chamber with the help of their coal and oil industry boosters rolled out a lobbying campaign to kill the bill in the senate using the same inaccurate and misleading tactics theyre using today for many companies protecting profits trumps the well being of the communities they serve heres a more realistic and tongueincheek view from the pacific institute of what happens to americas economic growth when you pass important environmental laws and it doesnt even include the 2009 tailpipe standards to cut carbon from cars and trucks that built on the fuel economy legislation i authored in the house but some people arent convinced past successes will be prologue thats why senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said the effects of this rule will be catastrophic and immediately introduced legislation to prevent the rules from ever taking effect in my home state of massachusetts weve been reducing emissions for years and the results arent catastrophic theyre amazing the new national epa rules say that america should reduce our carbon emissions from coal plants by 30 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels massachusetts as part of the regional agreement to cut emissions has already reduced emissions by roughly 40 percent from 2005 levels every coalfired power plant in massachusetts has either closed or announced plans to close soon to pick up the slack weve moved aggressively to natural gas renewables and energy efficiency massachusetts a small state known more for the perfect storm than for perfectly sunny days last year ranked 4th in the nation in solar deployment weve been the number one state in the nation for energy efficiency for three years in a row and well soon be breaking ground on the first offshore wind farm in the county so what were those catastrophic effects from all of these carboncutting clean energy actions well our employment rate outpaced the national average every single month except three since the 2008 financial crash we employ 80000 people in clean energy which is expected to grow to

massachusetts and radically slashing our emissions of global warming pollution weve grown our economy weve created good 21st century jobs weve reduced the amount of electricity we consume and we pay less for that electricity so much for catastrophe maybe thats why speaker john boehner called the new epa rules nuts instead to skip right past inaccurate predictions and straight to the empty attacks the dire economic predictions for these new power plant emissions standards may not be true but the hard reality of climate change is already here for 350 straight months the planets temperature has been above the 20th century average that means if you are 29 or younger you have never known a month without hotter than average temperatures the seas are rising storms are getting stronger droughts longer heat waves more intense last week i had the honor to meet and discuss climate change with pope francis and his top advisers at the vatican he understands as all of us do that regardless of faith or party we are all called to respond to this personal and planetary challenge thats why among all of the quotes about these epa rules that have no basis in reality i will heed the words of the holy father who said in may safeguard creation because if we destroy creation creation will destroy us never forget this these epa rules will allow the united states to engage in clean energy job creation that will benefit all of creation this is the challenge of our time and we must rise to meet it not sink to baseless claims and attacks",

            "text": "If you were wondering how long it would take climate change deniers and industrial polluters to analyze and criticize a new proposal to cut emissions from power plants, this week's historic announcement from the EPA gave us our answer: no time at all. And in one case, the criticism came before the proposal was even issued.\n\n \n\n That's what the US Chamber of Commerce decided to do, putting out a data-driven study on the effects of EPA's proposal days before it was released, using the wrong data. The Chamber may have anti-regulation propaganda down to a science, but their doom-and-gloom should still follow the laws of time-and-space. Their claims earned them a rating of four Pinnochios from Washington Post's fact-checkers.\n\nThe head of the Chamber, which is heavily supported by coal and oil companies, said that these new EPA standards for power plants would \"have a profound effect on the economy, on businesses, and on families.\"\n\nI agree. Because time and time again, when America sets strong environmental safeguards, the effects are profound. Millions of jobs are created as our innovative spirits rise to the challenge. Millions of Americans are healthier. Our air is cleaner, our water safer.\n\nOf course, none of this is new. In 2009, Congressman Henry Waxman and I built a formidable collation that included the utility industry, unions, consumer and faith-based groups, and many others to pass the Waxman-Markey climate legislation through the U.S. House of Representatives. But the Chamber, with the help of their coal and oil industry boosters, rolled out a lobbying campaign to kill the bill in the Senate using the same inaccurate and misleading tactics they're using today. For many companies, protecting profits trumps the well being of the communities they serve.\n\nHere's a more realistic, and tongue-in-cheek, view from the Pacific Institute of what happens to America's economic growth when you pass important environmental laws, and it doesn't even include the 2009 tailpipe standards to cut carbon from cars and trucks that built on the fuel economy legislation I authored in the House.\n\n\n\n But some people aren't convinced past successes will be prologue. That's why Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the effects of this rule will be \"catastrophic\", and immediately introduced legislation to prevent the rules from ever taking effect.\n\nIn my home state of Massachusetts, we've been reducing emissions for years, and the results aren't \"catastrophic\", they're amazing. The new national EPA rules say that America should reduce our carbon emissions from coal plants by 30 percent by 2030, from 2005 levels. Massachusetts, as part of the regional agreement to cut emissions, has already reduced emissions by roughly 40 percent from 2005 levels.\n\nEvery coal-fired power plant in Massachusetts has either closed or announced plans to close soon. To pick up the slack, we've moved aggressively to natural gas, renewables, and energy efficiency. Massachusetts, a small state known more for the perfect storm than for perfectly sunny days, last year ranked 4th in the nation in solar deployment. We've been the number one state in the nation for energy efficiency for three years in a row. And we'll soon be breaking ground on the first offshore wind farm in the county. So what were those catastrophic effects from all of these carbon-cutting clean energy actions?\n\nWell, our employment rate outpaced the national average every single month except three since the 2008 financial crash. We employ 80,000 people in clean energy, which is expected to grow to 90,000 by the end of this year. While electricity rates around the U.S. have climbed 13 percent over the past eight years, they have actually declined six percent in Massachusetts over that time. At the same time, our Massachusetts economy expanded by 23 percent, or nearly $80 billion, and the amount of electricity we consume actually declined.\n\nSo while putting a nail into the coffin of coal in Massachusetts and radically slashing our emissions of global warming pollution, we've grown our economy, we've created good 21st century jobs, we've reduced the amount of electricity we consume, and we pay less for that electricity.\n\nSo much for catastrophe.\n\nMaybe that's why Speaker John Boehner called the new EPA rules \"nuts\" instead, to skip right past inaccurate predictions and straight to the empty attacks.\n\nThe dire economic predictions for these new power plant emissions standards may not be true, but the hard reality of climate change is already here. For 350 straight months, the planet's temperature has been above the 20th century average.That means if you are 29 or younger, you have never known a month without hotter than average temperatures. The seas are rising. Storms are getting stronger. Droughts longer, heat waves more intense.\n\nLast week, I had the honor to meet and discuss climate change with Pope Francis and his top advisers at the Vatican. He understands, as all of us do, that regardless of faith or party, we are all called to respond to this personal and planetary challenge.\n\nThat's why, among all of the quotes about these EPA rules that have no basis in reality, I will heed the words of the Holy Father, who said in May: \"Safeguard Creation. Because if we destroy Creation, Creation will destroy us! Never forget this!\"\n\nThese EPA rules will allow the United States to engage in clean energy job creation that will benefit all of creation. This is the challenge of our time, and we must rise to meet it, not sink to baseless claims and attacks.",

            "text": "If Jesus was alive today he very well might be joining churches, universities, and cities in a burgeoning movement to shed investments in companies such as Exxon Mobil and Peabody Coal.\n\nThe fast-growing fossil-fuel divestment movement began with Bill McKibben’s “Global Warming’s Terrifying New Math” essay in Rolling Stone in July 2012, in which he outlined the moral power of a social movement to force change. The best known example was the anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s, which began on college campuses and ended up toppling the government of South Africa. Nelson Mandela, the face of that movement, has endorsed fossil-fuel divestment.\n\n“If we don’t act on climate change now, every sermon we’ll give in ten to 15 years will be on grief,” James Antal, Minister and President, Massachusetts Conference of the United Church of Christ, tells TakePart. He was arrested with Bill McKibben in August 2011 protesting the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nAfter reading McKibben’s Rolling Stone piece, he prayed about it and decided to craft a resolution that would be a model for other denominations. The resolution calling for the United Church of Christ to divest passed the denomination’s synod, or general assembly, with 76 percent approval, last week.\n\nThe United Church Fund, which is the investing arm for all churches within the denomination, already screens for tobacco, gambling, military, and alcohol-related stocks. Now it has a fifth item to screen—fossil fuels. And Antal wouldn’t be surprised to see other denominations follow the UCC.\n\nDivestment isn’t primarily an economic strategy, but a moral and political one. The aim is to “revoke the social license of Exxon,” says Antal. Just like in the struggle for civil rights or the fight to end Apartheid in South Africa, the more climate change is seen as a deeply moral issue, the more society moves towards action. At the same time, divestment builds political power by forcing our nation’s most prominent institutions and individuals sitting on college boards to choose a side. Divestment sparks a big discussion and gets prominent media attention, moving the case for action forward.\n\nAnd, some investors are beginning the long and ugly process of grappling with the fact that unburnable carbon in fossil fuels will create stranded assets, i.e., assets worth less on the market than on a balance sheet. Divesting from fossil fuels carries only a nominal impact—one calculation (PDF) based on past performance shows that the difference between a “screened portfolio” (one without fossil fuels) and an unscreened portfolio is only 0.0002 percent. But staying invested in fossil fuels is beginning to be seen as akin to investing in asbestos and tobacco.\n\nStudents at over 300 colleges have passed resolutions calling for their trustees to divest. So far, only a handful of smaller colleges, mostly in the Northeast, have agreed. In addition, nearly 20 cities, including Seattle, San Francisco, and Santa Monica, have all passed varying kinds of resolutions and pledges. But the huge University of California, with its $70 billion fund, and other large colleges show no signs of listening to their students.\n\nFossil fuel divestment even got a shoutout from a one-time community organizer whose first foray into politics was as a college student protesting anti-apartheid in the 1980s, and who’s since moved on to become President of the United States.\n\nOn June 25, Barack Obama gave a barn-burner of a speech on climate change in which he told Georgetown University students to “Invest. Divest.” Activists were delighted by the direct acknowledgment of their work; until that moment, awareness of the movement seemed limited to student newspapers, financial sections, and 350.org blog posts.\n\nHeather Moyer, a UCC member, was happy to see her environmental activism and Christian beliefs come together at the synod.\n\nShe tells TakePart: “If we believe that wrecking God’s creation to be wrong, then profiting from it is equally wrong.”",

            "text": "At a meeting in Dallas on Wednesday, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson told shareholders that protecting the environment doesn’t matter. “What good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers?” he asked. This dumbfoundingly ignorant question can only be attributed to corporate greed.\n\nOverlooking the faults with an anthropocentric viewpoint that places no value on anything unless it benefits humanity in some way, the belief that a healthy environment is not absolutely crucial to the welfare of humanity is ludicrous.\n\nExxonMobil’s CEO believes that human suffering will not occur while the environment continues to degrade and changes in weather patterns cause more-severe storms, flooding, sea level rise, drought, fires, and extreme heat waves, which can then cause food insecurity and displacement, and create climate refugees. The creation of millions of climate refugees could in turn cause security threats, religious conflict, political violence, and the spread of contagious disease.\n\nIn order to protect their money, giant corporations, like ExxonMobil and others in the oil and gas industry, will continue to fight against and therefore prolong the shift away from the fossil fuel paradigm, no matter how much scientific proof and evidence for anthropogenic climate change is revealed to them.\n\n2012 was a record year for creating climate refugees, with eight mega-disaster-induced displacement events, which displaced over one million people each, the two largest events (massive floods in India and Nigeria), which displaced over 6 million people each, and Hurricane Sandy, which displaced more than 775,000 in the US and 343,000 in Cuba, among other disasters. Despite this fact, it’s easy to see why corporate fat cats remain unfazed by the suffering of millions across the globe.\n\nRex Tillerson, who was named chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil in 2006, led the company to a $44.9 billion profit last year, coming close to ExxonMobil’s record earnings of $45.2 billion in 2008, more money in a single year than any other corporation in history.\n\nIn April, Dallas News reported that Tillerson got a 15 percent raise to $40.3 million. That month, ExxonMobil pointed to an exploration deal in the Arctic and new oil discoveries in Europe in Africa as “likely to pay significant rewards for shareholders for years to come.”\n\nAlso at their annual meeting on Wednesday, nearly three-quarters of ExxonMobil shareholders voted down a resolution that would require the company to set goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from using Exxon products, for the seventh time, according to Climate Progress.\n\nLast year, Tillerson told the Council on Foreign Relations that while there is “clearly” going to be a “warming impact” from increasing CO2 emissions, he believes the consequences of increased emissions will be “manageable.” And how does he propose to manage them? The solution, he said, is for humans to “adapt.”\n\n“What do you want to do if we think the future has sea level rising four inches, six inches? Where are the impacted areas, and what do you want to do to adapt to that? … Changes to weather patterns that move crop production areas around – we’ll adapt to that. It’s an engineering problem, and it has engineering solutions.”\n\nUnfortunately, it will be a difficult task to engineer a new habitable planet.\n\nBecause of the power of mammoth corporations to fund climate science denial and perpetuate the dependency on fossil fuels in order to keep their pockets filled, it may be that the only choice left to humanity is to adapt to severe weather events, a lack of food, land, and resources, and displacement of millions across the world. But certainly even a blind man can see that scenario will cause more suffering than shifting the fossil fuel paradigm.\n\nAlisha Mims is a writer and researcher for Ring of Fire.",

            "body": "apparitions in the fog washingtons blog after digesting the opinions of the shills shysters and scam artists i am ready to predict that i have no clue what will happen during 2013 the weekend weather last week was a perfect analogy for attempting to forecast the future the professional highly educated meteorologists predicted sunny warm weather just as the phd wall street paid economist mouthpieces assure the multitudes 2013 will be the year when zero interest rates and 12 trillion deficits will finally lead to sunny economic skies instead the weekend was overcast and damp as i was writing this article and watching the miraculous baltimore ravens comeback against denver i received a two minute warning from my wife i had to pick up my son and his buddies at the montgomery mall as i pulled the car out of the garage i backed out into fog that was thicker than pea soup ive driven the roads to the montgomery mall hundreds of times but the fog was so thick i couldnt see ten feet ahead i drove hesitantly wondering what might be just over the horizon or what might dart out from a side street i see 2013 as a year of maneuvering through thick fog with startling apparitions lurking to surprise us and force a deviation in our normal course as i proceeded cautiously through the murky mist there were few cars on the roads and the strip centers and fast food joints resembled haunted houses and grave yards i expected to see dracula frankensteins monster and wolfman panhandling on the corners the fog of uncertainty is engulfing the nation making consumers hesitant to spend and businesses reluctant to hire or invest it was like being in a commercial real estate horror film with space available now leasing and store closing signs startling me everywhere i turned the trip took a spooky turn as i passed branches of those zombie banks – bank of america and citigroup they dont even know theyre already dead i finally arrived at the mall passing thousands of empty parking spaces with a few cars huddled close to the zombie starring in night of the retailing dead – sears in the miasma the few visitors appeared to be automaton like consumers programmed to shuffle through the mall and buy things they dont need with money they dont have to say the road ahead for this country in 2013 is foggy would be an epic understatement lets hope it doesnt have a nightmare on elm street like ending virtually all of the mainstream media wall street banks and paid shill economists are in agreement that 2013 will see improvement in employment housing retail spending and of course the only thing that matters to the ruling class the stock market even among the alternative media there seems to be a consensus that we will continue to muddle through and the day of reckoning is still a few years off those who are predicting improvements are either ignorant of history or are being paid to predict improvement despite the overwhelming evidence of a worsening economic climate the mainstream media pundits fulfilling their assigned task of purveying feel good propaganda use the 10 stock market gain in 2012 as proof of economic recovery the facts prove otherwise real gdp using a dramatically understated inflation rate has barely grown by 1 in 2012 using a true measure of inflation the gdp was 2 during 2012 even this pitiful growth was generated by 0 interest rate deals for subprime auto loans through ally financial 85 owned by you the taxpayer and 7 year 0 home furnishing financing deals through ge capital and the other government subsidized too big to control wall street banks the federal government chipped in by guaranteeing fha subsidized 3 down payment loans on houses and handing out billions in loans to students so they can find themselves keep the unemployment rate down get drunk and if they graduate – enter debt servitude for decades the number of people who have left the workforce since last december 22 million almost matched the number of newly employed 24 million as the labor participation rate has collapsed to a three decade low of 636 the propagandists attempt to peddle this dreadful condition as a function of baby boomers retiring this is obliterated by the fact the 55 to 69 age bracket has added 4 million jobs since obama became president while the younger age brackets have lost 3 million jobs the working age population has grown by 13 million since 2007 and there are 4 million less people employed another 15 million americans were forced onto food stamps during 2012 bringing the total increase to 17 million since obama assumed office with 475 million depending on assistance to feed them a full 20 of all households in the us are dependent on this program costing taxpayers 76 billion versus 34 billion in 2008 another 48 million have joined the ranks of the disabled since 2009 with a dramatic surge when the 99 week unemployment benefits began to run out these trends are surely signs of recovery real average hourly earnings were flat in 2012 and have fallen 15 since obama became president the average middle class worker is making less than they were forty years ago using a true measure of inflation would reveal the true devastation wrought on the middle class as the things we need food energy shelter education healthcare have grown more expensive and the things we are brainwashed to buy igadgets hdtvs luxury autos bling by the masters of propaganda have been made easily accessible through credit the middle class has enslaved themselves in chains of debt the declining average wages since 1973 have forced families to have both spouses work outside the home with the consequence of more divorces children raised by strangers and the proliferation of depressed human beings the lost real income has been replaced by credit card auto mortgage and student loan debt the reason bernanke geithner obama wall street corporate titans and media pundits focus their attention on the stock market is because they are looking out for their fellow 1ers the working middle class once the backbone of this country own virtually no stocks the 88 stock market increase since march 2009 hasnt benefitted the middle class one iota the federal reserve engineered stock market recovery has benefitted moneyed bankers and wealthy corporate executives the very people who collapsed the worldwide financial system and received the bailouts when they should have gone to jail those who continue to tout a nonexistent economic recovery have focused on the manufactured stock market and housing recovery extrapolating those trends without understanding how it has been achieved a master plan implemented through the collusion of the federal reserve treasury department executive branch wall street cabal and corporate media conglomerates has created the illusion of recovery make no mistake about it those in power held clandestine meetings and had covert discussions that will never see the light of day in transcripts or recordings they developed a strategy to save themselves their fellow cronies and the corporate interests that run this country they threw the middle class senior citizens and young people under the bus in their sordid determination to retain their power wealth and control their multifaceted plan has been rolled out as follows reduce interest rates to 0 so wall street banks could borrow for free and reinvest in treasuries therefore earning risk free profits so they could rebuild their nonexistent capital the wall street banks also used the free money to generate trading profits using their hft supercomputers with only the occasional glitch jp morgan london whale 9 billion slipup corzine blowing up his firm and stealing 12 billion from ranchers farmers the ability to borrow at 0 has spurred these financial institutions to make 0 loans to subprime auto buyers and offer 7 year 0 interest deals on behalf of furniture electronics and appliance retailers this keynesian solution is supposed to spur demand and generate new jobs the reality is that bernankes zirp has transferred 400 billion of annual interest income from savers and senior citizens to the wall street bankers while setting the table for more massive bad debt writeoffs when the millions of subprime borrowers default the federal reserve and the treasury department forced the fasb to scrap mark to market accounting allowing the wall street banks to fraudulently value their worthless assets the federal reserve than tripled their balance sheet from 900 billion to 295 trillion by purchasing almost 1 trillion of toxic mortgage debt from the wall street banks at full face value of the debt the fed purchased treasuries to artificially lower mortgage rates and attempt to spur a housing recovery the wall street banks have purposely manipulated the foreclosure process and restricted the inventory of foreclosures available to purchase in conjunction with fannie mae and freddie mac large inventories of foreclosed properties have been sold in bulk to connected wall street firms at above market prices and positioned as rental properties the fha has done their part by guaranteeing 3 down payment mortgages and putting taxpayers on the hook for the billions in losses to come fannie and freddie have already lost 200 billion of taxpayer money since 2008 on behalf of the wall street banks the concerted effort to restrict the supply of homes available for sale resulted in the price of homes sold rising in 2012 those in power are attempting to resuscitate the millions of heavily indebted underwater home occupiers at the expense of the young and frugal who would buy when home prices dropped to a clearing level the same people who created the first housing bubble are attempting to reinflate it as a solution to our economic woes despite the fact that individual investors have pulled billions out of the stock market over the last three years the stock market has managed to approach alltime highs this has been the lynchpin of their plan the sole purpose of every qe initiated by bernanke has been to elevate the stock market academics like bernanke and krugman sell the wealth effect storyline to the masses as a way to spur consumer spending the only wealth effect is to shift the wealth of the working middle class to the ruling class who own the stocks and control the markets as each qe has further enriched the 1 the inflationary impact on energy food and clothing has destroyed the lives of millions in the middle class who own virtually no stocks the gap between the uberrich ruling class and the peasants has never been wider the master plan has succeeded in delaying the worst of the crisis further enriching the oligarchs further impoverishing the middle class fanning the flames of revolution across the globe provoking foreign adversaries inciting anger among the populace and darkening the mood of the country those predicting a return to the peaceful autumn like days of the late 90s reveal their ignorance of history winter is here and there are many dark days ahead before spring is discernible the linear thinking crowd who hang their hats on never ending progress spurred by technological innovation and a limitless supply of cheap resources are denying reality delusion and hope for a better tomorrow is not a strategy we have entered the 5 th year of this ongoing crisis fourth turnings do not fizzle out they build to a societal earth shattering crescendo american revolution civil war great depressionwwii economic financial social and global conditions do not progress during a twenty year crisis period driven by the generational configuration that arises once every 80 years an epic struggle between good and evil rich and poor government and governed young and old nation and nation awaits us over the next fifteen years no matter what happens in 2013 it will be driven by the core elements of this crisis – debt civic decay and global disorder in retrospect the spark might seem as ominous as a financial crash as ordinary as a national election or as trivial as a tea party the catalyst will unfold according to a basic crisis dynamic that underlies all of these scenarios an initial spark will trigger a chain reaction of unyielding responses and further emergencies the core elements of these scenarios debt civic decay global disorder will matter more than the details which the catalyst will juxtapose and connect in some unknowable way if foreign societies are also entering a fourth turning this could accelerate the chain reaction at home and abroad these events will reflect the tearing of the civic fabric at points of extreme vulnerability – problem areas where america will have neglected denied or delayed needed action – the fourth turning – strauss howe 1996 until debt do us part the storyline of austerity and deleveraging perpetuated through the mainstream media mouthpieces is unequivocally false as consumer debt has reached an alltime high of 277 trillion driven by a surge in subprime auto loans and subprime student loans the reason for the surge in these loans while credit card debt lingers 15 below the 2008 peak is because the federal government is doling out these loans with your tax dollars ally financial aka gmac aka ditech is under the complete control of the federal government and doesnt care about future losses the taxpayers wont notice another 1 billion in losses there are cadillac escalades silverados and ram pickups to peddle to morons without money could there be a more subprime borrower than a 20 year old majoring in african literature or a 40 year old former construction worker enrolled at the university of phoenix with 500000 other schmoes the federal government assumed control over the student loan market in 2009 and has proceeded to blow a new bubble they have driven tuition higher and enabled millions of barely functioning morons to enter college where they will not only fail but also be burdened by unpayable levels of nondischargeable debt now the government solution is to pass those bad debts onto you the taxpayer while encouraging even more debt for students here is an assessment of the new pay as you earn program from your owners businessweek we have one example of someone who might look similar to an mba student he starts out with a starting salary of 90000 and by the end of 20 years is making 243360 under the old ibr program hell have paid 409445 by year 25 and be forgiven 23892 of his loan balance under the new ibr repayment plan hell pay less than half of that or 202299 and be forgiven 208259 by year 20 the old ibr plan was punitive if you borrowed a lot of money made you pay more over time and trapped you so there were serious consequences to doing that it was a downside and a pretty big risk which is why you didnt see people borrowing without regard to how much it will cost the new plan essentially eliminates any downside or risk for that type of behavior and cuts payments in half and then some the enslavement of our children in student loan debt and handing them the bill for 200 trillion of unfunded entitlement liabilities will be the spark that ignites the worst part of this crisis those in power realized very quickly that without continued credit growth their entire corrupt repugnant fiat currency based debt system would implode and they would lose all of their fraudulently acquired wealth that is why total credit market debt is at an alltime high of 56 trillion and 350 of gdp the national debt of 165 trillion is now 103 of gdp well beyond the rogoff reinhart level of 90 that always leads to economic crisis and turmoil as wall street bankers acted like lemmings leading up to the 2008 financial collapse the famous july 2007 quote from charles prince ceo of citigroup summed it up nicely when the music stops in terms of liquidity things will be complicated but as long as the music is playing youve got to get up and dance were still dancing now central bankers across the globe are dancing an irish jig every major central banker in the world is lemmingly following bernankes lead and printing money at hyperspeed the europeans have surpassed the japanese in their quest to become the first casualty in the coming debt collapse bernanke in his quest to not be outdone has committed to taking his balance sheet to 25 of gdp within the next year japan has vowed not to be outdone the currency debasement race is gathering steam the devastation anger resentment and ultimately war caused by these bankers will engulf the world when it reaches its apocalyptic ending will the grain of sand that collapses the pile be a debt ceiling crisis as postulated by strauss howe an impasse over the federal budget reaches a stalemate the president and congress both refuse to back down triggering a neartotal government shutdown the president declares emergency powers congress rescinds his authority dollar and bond prices plummet the president threatens to stop social security checks congress refuses to raise the debt ceiling default looms wall street panics – the fourth turning – strauss howe – 1996 i dont think so the democrats and republicans are playing their parts in this theater of the absurd neither party has any desire to cut spending reduce our debt or secure the future of unborn generations in 2013 i see the following things happening related to our debt crisis the debt ceiling will be raised as the toothless republican party vows to cut spending next time the political hacks will create a 3000 page document of triggers and create a committee to study the issue with actual measures that slow the growth of annual spending by 000005 starting in 2017 the national debt will increase by 125 trillion and debt to gdp will reach 106 by the end of the fiscal year the federal reserve balance sheet will reach 4 trillion by the end of the year consumer debt will reach 29 trillion as the feds accelerate student loans and ally financial along with the other too big to control wall street banks keep pumping out subprime auto loans by midyear reported losses on student loans will soar and auto loan delinquencies will show an upturn this will force a slowdown in consumer debt issuance exacerbating the recession that started in 2012 the bakken oil miracle will prove to be nothing more than wall street shysters selling a storyline daily output will stall at 750000 barrels per day and the dreams of imminent energy independence will be annihilated by reality again the price of oil will average 105 per barrel as global tensions restrict supply the home price increases generated through inventory manipulation in 2012 will peter out as 2013 progresses the market has been flooded by investors there is very little real demand for new homes young households with heavy student loan debt and low paying jobs will continue to rent since the oligarchs refused to let prices fall to a level that would spur real demand mortgage delinquencies will rise as job growth remains stagnant leading to an increase in foreclosures rent prices will flatten as apartment construction and investors flood the market with supply the disconnect between the stock market and the housing and employment markets will be rectified when the msm can no longer deny the recession that began in 2012 and will deepen in the first part of 2013 while housing prices languish 30 below their peak levels of 2006 the stock market has prematurely ejaculated back to precrisis levels declining corporate profits stagnant consumer spending and increasing debt defaults will finally result in a 20 decline in the stock market with a chance for losses greater than 30 if japan or the eu begin to crumble japan is still a bug in search of a windshield with a debt to gdp ratio of 230 a population dying off energy dependence escalating trade surplus decreasing an already failed prime minister vowing to increase inflation and rising tensions with china japan is a primary candidate to be the first domino to fall in the game of debt chicken a 2 increase in interest rates would destroy the japanese economic system the eu has temporarily delayed the endgame for their failed experiment economic conditions in greece spain and italy worsen by the day with unemployment reaching dangerous revolutionary levels pretending countries will pay each other with newly created debt will not solve a debt crisis they dont have a liquidity problem they have a solvency problem the only people who have been saved by the actions taken so far are bankers and politicians i believe the crisis will reignite with interest rates spiking in spain italy and france the germans will get fed up with the rest of europe and the eu will begin to disintegrate civic decay accelerates history offers no guarantees if america plunges into an era of depression or violence which by then has not lifted we will likely look back on the 1990s as the decade when we valued all the wrong things and made all the wrong choices – strauss howe the fourth turning the liberal minded oped writers that decry the incivility of dialogue today once again show their ignorance for or contempt for american history they call for compromise and coming together they should see spielbergs lincoln to understand the uncompromising nature of fourth turnings and how conflicts are resolved they should watch documentary film of dresden hiroshima and guadalcanal during world war ii compromise and civility do not compute during a fourth turning it is compromise that has brought us to this point avoiding tough decisions and delaying action occur during the unraveling weve known the entitlement issues confronting our nation for over a decade and chose to do nothing the time for delay and inaction is long gone the pressing issues of the day will be resolved through collapse confrontation and bloodshed its the way it has always been done and the way it shall be the current conflict over banning guns is just a symptom of a bigger disease government at the behest of the owners has been steadily assuming more power and control over the everyday lives of citizens who just want to be left to live their lives government has used propaganda fear and misinformation to convince large swaths of the populace to voluntarily sacrifice their freedom and liberty for the promise of safety and security warrantless surveillance imprisonment without charges molestation by tsa agents military exercises in cities drones in our skies cameras watching our every move overseas torture undeclared wars cyberattacks on sovereign countries and now the threat of disarmament of the people have all contributed to the darkening skies above a harsh winter lies ahead civic decay is being driven by two main thrusts lack of jobs and destruction of middle class wealth by the oligarchs is resulting in the anger and dismay overwhelming the country the chart below reveals the truth about our economy and the fraudulent nature of bls reported data skewed to paint a false picture the 25 to 54 year old age bracket captures americans in their peak earnings years in 2007 this age bracket had 83 of its members in the labor force and 1005 million of them employed today according to the bls only 814 are in the labor force and there are 63 million less employed the bls has the gall to report that since 2009 even though the number of employed people in this age bracket has declined by 1 million the number of unemployed people has dropped by 15 million people to report this drivel is beyond laughable the horrific labor market situation is confirmed by the fact that despite a 36 million person increase in this age demographic since 2000 there are 78 million more people not employed the reduced earnings and savings of the people in this demographic is having profound and longlasting impact on our society household formation retirement savings tax revenues and selfworth are all negatively impacted the mood of desperation and anger is materializing in this age bracket the resentment of these people when they see the wellheeled wall street set reaping stock market gains and bonuses while they make do on food stamps extended unemployment and the charity of friends and family is palpable more than 100 of the employment gains since 2010 have gone to those over the age of 55 further embittering the 25 to 54 workers there is boiling anger beneath the thin veneer of civility between millenials genxers and boomers the chasm between the ultrarich and the masses widens by the day and is leading to a seething animosity the country has lost 24 million construction jobs and 2 million manufacturing jobs since 2007 but weve added 250000 fry cook jobs and 440000 university of phoenix jobs stimulated by 500 billion in student loans the complete transformation of a producing society to a consumption society has been accomplished when the average person sees wall street bankers not only walk away unscathed from the crisis they aided abetted and created through their fraudulent inducements and documentation but be further enriched at taxpayer expense their hatred and disgust with high financers like corzine dimon and blankfein burns white hot the mainstream media propaganda machine tries to convince the average joe that stock market highs and record corporate profits are beneficial to him even though the gains and profits have been spurred by zero interest rates fraudulent accounting and outsourcing their jobs to third world slave labor factories a critical thinking human being this rules out 95 of the adult population might question how corporate profits could surpass precollapse levels when the economy has remained stagnant shockingly the entire profit surge was driven by wall street accounting entries relieving billions of loan loss reserves earning hundreds of millions in risk free interest courtesy of bernanke and falsely valuing your loan portfolio can do wonders for profits weve added 69 million finance jobs in the last 20 years as this industry has sucked the lifeblood out of our nation a country that allows bankers to syphon off 35 of all the profits in the country without producing any benefits to society is destined to fail with the dire consequences that follow my civic decay expectations for 2013 are as follows progressives attempt to distract the masses from our worsening economic situation with their assault on the 2 nd amendment will fail congress will pass no new restrictions on gun ownership and 2013 will see the highest level of gun sales in history the deepening recession higher taxes on small businesses and middle class along with obamacare mandates will lead to rising unemployment and rising anger with the failed economic policies of the last four years protests and rallies will begin to burgeon the number of people on food stamps will reach 50 million and the number of people on ssdi will reach 11 million jamie dimon lloyd blankfein and jeff immelt will compensate themselves to the tune of 100 million cnbc will proclaim an economic recovery based on these facts the drought will continue in 2013 resulting in higher food prices ethanol prices and shipping costs as transporting goods on the mississippi river will become further restricted the misery index for the average american family will reach new highs there will be assassination attempts on political and business leaders as retribution for their actions during and after the financial crisis the revelation of more fraud in the financial sector will result in an outcry from the public for justice prosecutions will be pursued by states attorney generals as holder has been captured by wall street the deepening pension crisis in the states will lead to more state worker layoffs and more confrontation between governors attempting to balance budgets and government worker unions there will be more municipal bankruptcies the gun issue will further enflame talk of state secession the red stateblue state divide will grow ever wider the msm will aggravate the divisions with vitriolic propaganda the government will accelerate their surveillance efforts and renew their attempt to monitor control and censor the internet this will result in increased cyberattacks on government and corporate computer networks in retaliation global disorder spreads eventually all of americas lesser problems will combine into one giant problem the very survival of the society will feel at stake as leaders lead and people follow the emergent society may be something better a nation that sustains its framers visions with a robust new pride or it may be something unspeakably worse the fourth turning will be a time of glory or ruin – strauss howe the fourth turning the entire world resembles a powderkeg in a room full of monkeys with matches as economic conditions worsen around the world the poor destitute and unemployed increasingly have begun to revolt against their banker masters money printing reporting fraudulent economic data and pretending to make debt payments with newly issued debt does not employ anyone or put food in the mouths of the people with worldwide unemployment surpassing 200 million food and energy prices surging peasants in the far east treated like slave laborers politicians stealing from the people to enrich their banker owners and young people losing hope for a better tomorrow the likelihood of strikes protests armed revolution and war is high the world is about to find out the downside to globalization as turmoil in europe or asia will swiftly impact those in the rest of the world that are interconnected through trade and financial instruments the trillions of derivatives that link financial institutions across the world will ignite like a string of firecrackers once a spark reaches the fuse treaties and alliances between countries will immediately enlarge localized military conflicts into worldwide confrontations dwindling supplies of cheap oil and potable water a changing climate whether cyclical or human activity based that is creating droughts floods and superstorms on a more frequent basis and religious zealotry set the stage for resource wars and religious wars around the globe and particularly in the middle east fourth turnings always intensify and ultimately lead to total war with no compromise and clear winners and losers the proxy wars that have been waged for the last 60 years will look like kindergarten snack time when the culmination of this fourth turning war results in death on a scale that would be considered incomprehensible today and it will happen within the next fifteen years the climactic war is still a few years off but here is what i think will happen in 2013 with new leadership in japan and china neither will want to lose face so early in their new terms neither side will back down in their ongoing conflict over islands in the east china sea china will shoot down a japanese aircraft and trade between the countries will halt leading to further downturns in both of their economies worker protests over slave labor conditions in chinese factories will increase as food price increases hit home on peasants that spend 70 of their pay for food the new regime will crackdown with brutal measures but the protests will grow increasingly violent the economic data showing growth will be discredited by what is happening on the ground china will come in for a real hard landing maybe they can hide the billions of bad debt in some of their vacant cities violence and turmoil in greece will spread to spain during the early part of the year with protests and anger spreading to italy and france later in the year the eu public relations campaign built on sandcastles of debt in the sky and false promises of corrupt politicians will falter by midyear interest rates will begin to spike and the endgame will commence greece will depart the eu with spain not far behind the unraveling of debt will plunge all of europe into depression iran will grow increasingly desperate as hyperinflation caused by us economic sanctions provokes the leadership to lash out at its neighbors and unleash cyberattacks on saudi arabian oil facilities and us corporations israel will use the rising tensions as the impetus to finally attack iranian nuclear facilities the us will support the attack and iran will launch missiles at saudi arabia and israel in retaliation the price of oil will spike above 125 per barrel further deepening the worldwide recession syrian president assad will be ousted and executed by rebels syria will fall under the control of islamic rebels who will not be friendly to the united states or israel russia will stir up discontent in retaliation for the ouster of their ally egypt and libya will increasingly become islamic states and will further descend into civil war the further depletion of the cantarell oil field will destroy the mexican economy as it becomes a net energy importer the drug violence will increase and more illegal immigrants will pour into the us the us will station military troops along the border cyberattacks by china and iran on government and corporate computer networks will grow increasingly frequent one or more of these attacks will threaten nuclear power plants our electrical grid or the pentagon so now im on the record for 2013 and i can be scorned and ridiculed for being such a pessimist when december rolls around and our ponzi scheme economy hasnt collapsed there is no disputing the facts the economic situation is deteriorating for the average american the mood of the country is darkening and the world is awash in debt and turmoil every country is attempting to print their way to renewed prosperity no one wins a race to the bottom the oligarchs have chosen a path of currency debasement propping up insolvent banks propaganda and impoverishing the masses as their preferred course they attempt to keep the masses distracted with political theater gun control vitriol reality tv and igadgets what can be said about a society where 10 of the population follows justin bieber and lady gaga on twitter and where 50 think the national debt is a monument in washington dc the country is controlled by evil sycophants intellectually dishonest toadies and blood sucking leeches their lies and deception have held sway for the last four years but they have only delayed the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit expansion they will not reverse course and believe their intellectual superiority will allow them to retain their control after the collapse washington has become our versailles we are ruled entertained and informed by courtiers — and the media has evolved into a class of courtiers the democrats like the republicans are mostly courtiers our pundits and experts at least those with prominent public platforms are courtiers we are captivated by the hollow stagecraft of political theater as we are ruthlessly stripped of power it is smoke and mirrors tricks and con games and the purpose behind its deception – chris hedges every day more people are realizing the conjob being perpetuated by the owners of this country will the tipping point be reached in 2013 i dont know but the era of decisiveness and confrontation has arrived the people will learn there are consequences to our actions and inaction the existing social order will be swept away are you prepared the era of procrastination of halfmeasures of soothing and baffling expedients of delays is coming to a close in its place we are entering a period of consequences – winston churchill",

summer the ba everywhere campaign is planning to make big advances in impacting society—changing how people think about the world—why it is the way it is and how it could be radically transformed through revolution—with crucial steps towards millions of people knowing that there is a way out of the horror and madness of today this summer hundreds and then thousands of people need to become a part of raising the big funds necessary so that this is known in every corner of society look around talk to people check out the news the world is in great turmoil people agonize about the state of their lives the state of the world even the planets survival lives are stolen by the millions—in wars in people fleeing desperately across militarized borders in the prisons dreams are thwarted and crushed peoples anger at the brutality degradation and profound alienation that so many feel gets taken out against each other and themselves there is profound discontent that seethes beneath the surface yet people dont understand the root cause of why the world is the way it is and that a radically different way the world could be is possible they have deep questions—questions they often havent even allowed themselves to ask when confronted with what is to be done about the state of the world people hit an ideological block this can and must change the ba everywhere campaign is about making that change people need to know about the revolutionary leader bob avakian ba and engage the work he has done nobody speaks to the questions confronting humanity like ba he has analyzed in a more scientific way the problem humanity confronts in the capitalistimperialist system hes broken this down so people can understand this and work with the framework he has developed even more fundamentally he has charted the way forward forging a viable vision and framework for a radically better world ba has developed a new synthesis of communism that provides a deep scientific understanding of the methods goals strategy and plan for making revolution and creating a far better society leading to the emancipation of humanity and he leads a party the rcp usa that is building a movement for revolution here and now this must be a summer and accelerating into the fall when ba and what he has brought forward becomes known by millions of people a time when thousands then tens of thousands not only hear about ba but engage his work reading watching discussing debating and going out to friends relatives and colleagues with what they learn a time when as people talk about how bad things are others will say have you checked out ba and the party and movement for revolution he leads a time when throughout the country people are familiar with who ba is and have a basic sense of what he stands for—and this becomes a reference point when people talk about what is to be done about the big questions of the state of the world and as a part of this a growing section of people is connecting with the party and the movement for revolution for this to really be—to make ba known on a huge scale—requires serious money and that takes lots of people raising funds from thousands more people raising funds is being serious and its making a difference—by those who do the asking and by those who donate the campaign kicks into a higher gear at picnics across the country on the july 4th weekend with the words of the escaped slave and freedom fighter frederick douglass what to a slave is your fourth of july and answers with a theme for the summer we refuse to accept slavery in any form the ba everywhere campaign is crucial as the leading edge of a whole ensemble of revolutionary work to changing blocs of peoples thinking to where the possibility of ending all forms of slavery would be possible breaking through the ways that peoples thinking is trapped within the confines of what is—that this dogeatdog system is the best and only way the world could be and consciously or unconsciously accepting the verdict from those who rule or defend this capitalistimperialist system that the communist revolutions of the 20th century were a failure the ba everywhere campaign is bringing something different a deep understanding of why the world is the way it is— the problem and that there is another way the world could be through revolution as concentrated in the new synthesis of communism developed by ba— the solution bob avakian and the ba everywhere campaign are about this problem and solution—nothing less if this is made known in all corners of society that would change the face of everything—with the biggest questions and biggest dreams for the future being debated and setting terms to get to that point means lots of people joining the campaign summer 2014 must see the ba everywhere campaign going out to the people in a bold mass way stirring things up—as the leading edge of a whole ensemble of revolutionary work thats fighting the power and transforming the people for revolution inviting and involving people in spreading ba and raising funds to do so on an ever greater scale and unleashing a societywide ideological struggle over whats the problem and the revolutionary solution ba everywhere committees should be growing canvassing reaching out and raising funds building community in the parks housing projects summer festivals to realize the ambitious vision for this summer and fall will mean working with people having lots of entrylevel ways that many people can join providing people with a vision and plan—an approach that revolutionaries call grasp revolution promote production —and breaking down the ways for people to be a part of making this real the campaign should be out among the people – raising sights and giving them the opportunity to learn about and contribute to something that could make a tremendous difference for humanity running through everything this summer is the film ba speaks revolution—nothing less this mindblowing talk is 6 hours that can change how people see the world and what they do with the rest of their lives ba says in the film those this system has cast off those it has treated as less than human can be the backbone and driving force of a fight to not only end their own oppression but to finally end all oppression and emancipate all of humanity this speaks to a big part of the heart of another theme for this summer revolution in the city—reaching out to and challenging especially the youth in the crosshairs of this system making this a summer where ba everywhere is the leading edge of the whole ensemble of work that is preparing today for revolution where when people are organizing for the october month of resistance against mass incarceration and fighting back against this they are finding out about ba everywhere where when people are organizing for the abortion rights freedom ride and fighting back against the attacks on women they are finding out about ba everywhere where when people are organizing for the massive climate march at the un in new york on september 2021 2014 and fighting back to save the environment they are finding out about ba everywhere where when people come together at concerts and festivals that inspire and bring people together they are finding out about ba everywhere in the context of the overall ba everywhere campaign there are several focuses each of these focuses should serve to project ba and the campaign as a whole far and wide and should raise significant funds for the projects themselves and for the campaign as a whole 1000 years–1000 for ba everywhere is a call to prisoners exprisoners families and friends of individuals locked up in the massive penitentiaries of america along with people from all walks of life who feel that this is immoral and intolerable already way over 1000 years of prison sentences have been accumulated with a dollar raised for each year served by those who have pledged their own or a loved ones or friends years and this has begun to be multiplied several times over by many others donating matching and multiplying funds the potential of this campaign is huge by the month of resistance in october 1000 years–1000 should aim to raise tens of thousands of dollars and this should be expressed in a national day of major determined action that involves hundreds of people in early october as a part of the month of resistance second is a project to fund ba speaks revolution—nothing less tshirts and ba image tshirts to create a growing sense that ba and the movement for revolution is spreading the shirts should become a statement of defiance wearing the shirt represents standing with a leader who is about getting rid of this criminal system and bringing about a world fit for human beings youth and others should be getting sponsorships for their shirts and joining with the ba everywhere campaign to raise big funds to subsidize many more shirts so that as these are worn at coordinated times and especially in the heat of sharp struggles they create an impact reverberating throughout society the campaign should be raising thousands of dollars to make this possible inspiring donors to donate way more than the cost of the shirts themselves the ba everywhere campaign is calling for a you cant break all the chains but one day in early august that is focused on basics 322 a day of determination to end the oppression of women and of celebration of the publication of the break all the chains bob avakian on the emancipation of women and the communist revolution the whole summer should see massive distribution of the sampler edition of this seminal work by ba on the liberation of women the week leading up to this day could involve screenings at bookstores street theater and going out to actions and speakouts supporting the abortion rights freedom ride which will be just getting underway in texas this day should bring together all kinds of people who want to end slavery in all its forms—an occasion to share experiences marshal forces and raise funds in late august the ba everywhere campaign is calling for nationally coordinated screenings of ba speaks revolution—nothing less we will show about 7590 minutes of the film and have a short program these events will cap off the summer and be a pivot towards fall—culminating the summer outreach and fundraising and reaching out to and involving even more people to make an even bigger impact as school starts an important objective and focus of the ba everywhere campaign especially in august should be inspiring and organizing people of all strata to join in taking ba everywhere out to the campuses at the start of the semester and there should be a special focus on organizing a significant revolution—nothing less contingent—with scores of people especially youth wearing the tshirts—at the september 2021 a call to arms an invitation to demand action on climate change demonstration in nyc coinciding with the un climate summit 2014 indeed throughout august the campaign should be bringing to people why and how only revolution could begin to really tackle the problem of a sustainable planet each of these component focuses should serve to strengthen the whole of the ba everywhere campaign—getting out broadly going deeply into problem and solution with people and sparking lively debate and involving many people getting them organized into committees and with the national campaign to raise the big funds that are necessary to make a big impact with ba

request cable see paragraph 7 2 sbu summary unfao food and agriculture syria representative abdullah bin yehia is seeking usg commitment to the un office for coordination of humanitarian affairs 2008 drought appeal yehia proposes to use money from the appeal to provide seed and technical assistance to 15000 smallholding farmers in northeast syria in an effort to preserve the social and economic fabric of this rural agricultural community if unfao efforts fail yehia predicts mass migration from the northeast which could act as a multiplier on social and economic pressures already at play and undermine stability syria end summary syrian drought appeal in short 3 sbu the un office for coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha launched an appeal on september 29 requesting roughly 2023 million to assist an estimated one million people impacted by what the un describes as the countrys worst drought in four decades the appeal details seven major projects that members of the un country team fao undp wfp who and unicef plan to undertake should funding materialize roughly 14 million is requested to support fao 936 million and undp 482 million efforts to restore food production and safeguard agricultural livelihoods and 52 million is being sought by wfp to provide emergency food assistance to the victims of the drought there does not appear to have been much movement on the part of donor countries to fund this appeal thus far as most of the funding has come from unearmarked un funds and the central emergency response fund cerf equaling together roughly 246 million the italians have an uncommitted pledge of 700 thousand for food assistance additionally un contacts report the chinese have committed to providing approximately 500000 and that the greeks are considering a contribution of up to 250000 fao perspective 4 sbu unfao syria representative abdullah bin yehia briefed econoff and usda regional ministercounselor for agriculture on what he terms the perfect storm a confluence of drought conditions with other economic and social pressures that yehia believes could undermine stability in syria because he is working with such limited resources yehia plans to target fao assistance to smallholding farmers in the hardesthit province of northeast syria al hasakah note this province shares a northern border with turkey and a southern border with iraq mosul is approximately 100km from al hasakah province because the un appeal has thus far not been entirely successful yehia has had to prioritize aid recipients fao has about 125 million out of the 936 million sought to begin programmatic work for now fao aid will be awarded only to farmers who meet all of the following criteria applicant is head of household has a holding of no more than two hectares reports agriculture as the sole source of livelihood holds no more than seven or eight head of livestock had a zero crop yield for 2008 and has no seed stock for replanting a 2009 crop potential for social destruction and political instability 5 c yehia does notnot believe that the sarg will allow any syrian citizen to starve note it is estimated that sarg wheat stocks are sufficient to continue to provide subsidized bread in all areas of syria throughout the coming winter end note however yehia told us that the syrian minister of agriculture at a july meeting with un officials stated publicly that economic and social fallout from the drought was beyond our capacity as a country to deal with damascus 00000847 002 of 002 what the un is trying to combat through this appeal yehia says is the potential for social destruction that would accompany erosion of the agricultural industry in rural syria this social destruction would lead to political instability yehia told us he fears that up to 15000 rural farmers will fail to plant crops for the 2009 growing season either because they have no residual seed stock from the disastrous 2008 crop or because they are hesitant to plant seed bought on credit for fear of a repeat of the 20072008 cold snap that killed seedlings last year another factor at play according to yehia is the rising cost of diesel fuel in syria as the sarg continues to reduce subsidies this translates into rising production costs providing an additional disincentive for small farmers to maintain their holdings unfao proposes to provide smallholding farmers in al hasakah province who meet the above criteria see paragraph 4 with seed stock and technical assistance so that they might realize a 2009 crop and remain on their farms for the foreseeable future 6 c without direct fao assistance yehia predicts that most of these 15000 smallholding farmers would be forced to depart al hasakah province to seek work in larger cities in western syria damascus and aleppo primarily approximately 100000 dependents women children and the elderly or infirm would be left behind to live in poverty he said children would be likely to be pulled from school he warned in order to seek a source of income for families left behind in addition the migration of 15000 unskilled laborers would add to the social and economic pressures presently at play in major syrian cities a system already burdened by a large iraqi refugee population may not be able to absorb another influx of displaced persons yehia explained particularly at this time of rising costs growing dissatisfaction of the middle class and a perceived weakening of the social fabric and security structures that syrians have come to expect and in some cases rely on 7 sbu action request post received several queries as to whether the us intends to contribute to the 2008 syrian drought appeal and we request department guidance on the matter unfao is seeking immediate donor commitments that will allow them to borrow against the un cerf according to yehia unfao is trying to get seed stock to farmers in al hasakah by middecember to ensure that they do not miss the window for planting a 2009 crop 8 c comment given the generous funding the us currently provides to the iraqi refugee community in syria and the persistent problems wfp is experiencing with its efforts to import food for the refugee population we question whether limited usg resources should be directed toward this appeal at this time connelly",

            "body": "the churchill society london churchills speeches i have with some friends put an amendment on the paper it is the same as the amendment which i submitted two years ago and i have put it in exactly the same terms because i thought it would be a good thing to remind the house of what has happened in these two years our amendment in november 1934 was the culmination of a long series of efforts by private members and by the conservative party in the country to warn his majestys government of the dangers to europe and to this country which were coming upon us through the vast process of german rearmament then already in full swing the speech which i made on that occasion was much censured as being alarmist by leading conservative newspapers and i remember that mr lloyd george congratulated the prime minister who was then lord president on having so satisfactorily demolished my extravagant fears what would have been said i wonder if i could two years ago have forecast to the house the actual course of events suppose we had then been told that germany would spend for two years £800000000 a year upon warlike preparations that her industries would be organised for war as the industries of no country have ever been that by breaking all treaty engagements she would create a gigantic air force and an army based on universal compulsory service which by the present time in 1936 amounts to upwards of thirtynine divisions of highly equipped troops including mechanised divisions of almost unmeasured strength and that behind all this there lay millions of armed and trained men for whom the formations and equipment are rapidly being prepared to form another eighty divisions in addition to those already perfected suppose we had then known that by now two years of compulsory military service would be the rule with a preliminary year of training in labour camps that the rhineland would be occupied by powerful forces and fortified with great skill and that germany would be building with our approval signified by treaty a large submarine fleet suppose we had also been able to foresee the degeneration of the foreign situation our quarrel with italy the italogerman association the belgian declaration about neutrality which if the worst interpretation of it proves to be true so greatly affects the security of this country and the disarray of the smaller powers of central europe suppose all that had been forecast why no one would have believed in the truth of such a nightmare tale yet just two years have gone by and we see it all in broad daylight where shall we be this time two years i hesitate now to predict let me say however that i will not accept the mood of panic or of despair there is another side a side which deserves our study and can be studied without derogating in any way from the urgency which ought to animate our military preparations the british navy is and will continue to be incomparably the strongest in europe the french army will certainly be for a good many months to come at least equal in numbers and superior in maturity to the german army the british and french air forces together are a very different proposition from either of those forces considered separately while no one can prophesy it seems to me that the western democracies provided they are knit closely together would be tolerably safe for a considerable number of months ahead no one can say to a month or two or even a quarter or two how long this period of comparative equipoise will last but it seems certain that during the year 1937 the german army will become more numerous than the french army and very much more efficient than it is now it seems certain that the german air force will continue to improve upon the long lead which it already has over us particularly in respect of longdistance bombing machines the year 1937 will certainly be marked by a great increase in the adverse factors which only intense efforts on our part can to effective extent countervail the efforts at rearmament which france and britain are making will not by themselves be sufficient it will be necessary for the wetern democracies even at some extension of their risks to gather round them all the elements of collective security or of combined defensive strength against aggression if you prefer as i do myself to call it so which can be assembled on the basis of the covenant of the league of nations thus i hope we may succeed in again achieving a position of superior force and then will be the time not to repeat the folly which we committed when we were allpowerful and supreme but to invite germany to make common cause with us in assuaging the griefs of europe and opening a new door to peace and disarmament i now turn more directly to the issues of this debate let us examine our own position no one can refuse his sympathy to the minister for the coordination of defence from time to time my right hon friend lets fall phrases or facts which show that he realises more than anyone else on that bench it seems to me the danger in which we stand one such phrase came from his lips the other night he spoke of the years that the locust hath eaten let us see which are these years that the locust hath eaten even if we do not pry too closely in search of the locusts who have eaten these precious years for this purpose we must look into the past from the year 1932 certainly from the beginning of 1933 when herr hitler came into power it was general public knowledge in this country that serious rearmament had begun in germany there was a change in the situation three years ago at the conservative conference at birmingham that vigorous and faithful servant of this country lord lloyd moved the following resolution that this conference desires to record its grave anxiety in regard to the inadequacy of the provisions made for imperial defence that was three years ago and i see from the times report of that occasion that l said during the last four or five years the world had grown gravely darker we have steadily disarmed partly with a sincere desire to give a lead to other countries and partly through the severe financial pressure of the time but a change must now be made we must not continue longer on a course in which we alone are growing weaker while every other nation is growing stronger the resolution was passed unanimously with only a rider informing the chancellor of the exchequer that all necessary burdens of taxation would be cheerfully borne there were no locusts there at any rate i am very glad to see the prime minister mr baldwin restored to his vigour and to learn that he has been recuperated by his rest and also as we hear rejuvenated it has been my fortune to have ups and downs in my political relations with him the downs on the whole predominating perhaps but at any rate we have always preserved agreeable personal relations which so far as i am concerned are greatly valued i am sure he would not wish in his conduct of public affairs that there should be any shrinking from putting the real issues of criticism which arise and would certainly proceed in that sense my right hon friend has had all the power for a good many years and therefore there rests upon him inevitably the main responsibility for everything that has been done or not done and also the responsibility for what is to be done or not done now so far as the air is concerned this responsibility was assumed by him in a very direct personal manner even before he became prime minister i must recall the words which he used in the debate on 8 march 1934 nearly three years ago in answer to an appeal which i made to him both publicly and privately he said any government of this country a national government more than any and this government will see to it that in air strength and air power this country shall no longer be in a position inferior to any country within striking distance of our shores well sir i accepted that solemn promise but some of my friends like sir edward grigg and captain guest wanted what the minister for the coordination of defence in another state of being would have called further and better particulars and they raised a debate after dinner when the prime minister then lord president came down to the house and really showed less than his usual urbanity in chiding those members for even venturing to doubt the intention of the government to make good in every respect the pledge which he had so solemnly given in the afternoon i do not think that responsibility was ever more directly assumed in a more personal manner the prime minister was not successful in discharging that task and he admitted with manly candour a year later that he had been led into error upon the important question of the relative strength of the british and german air power no doubt as a whole his majestys government were very slow in accepting the unwelcome fact of german rearmament they still clung to the policy of onesided disarmament it was one of those experiments we are told which had to be to use a vulgarism tried out just as the experiments of nonmilitary sanctions against italy had to be tried out both experiments have now been tried out and ministers are accustomed to plume themselves upon the very clear results of those experiments they are held to prove conclusively that the policies subjected to the experiments were all wrong utterly foolish and should never be used again and the very same men who were foremost in urging those experiments are now foremost in proclaiming and denouncing the fallacies upon which they were based they have bought their knowledge they have bought it dear they have bought it at our expense but at any rate let us be duly thankful that they now at last possess it in july 1935 before the general election there was a very strong movement in this house in favour of the appointment of a minister to concert the action of the three fighting services moreover at that time the departments of state were all engaged in drawing up the large schemes of rearmament in all branches which have been laid before us in the white paper and upon which we are now engaged one would have thought that that was the time when this new minister or coordinator was most necessary he was not however in fact appointed until nearly nine months later in march 1936 no explanation has yet been given to us why these nine months were wasted before the taking of what is now an admittedly necessary measure the prime minister dilated the other night no doubt very properly the great advantages which had flowed from the appointment of the minister for the coordination of defence every argument used to show how useful has been the work which he has done accuses the failure to appoint him nine months earlier when inestimable benefits would have accrued to us by the saving of this long period when at last in march after all the delays the prime minister eventually made the appointment the arrangement of duties was so illconceived that no man could possibly discharge them with efficiency or even make a speech about them without embarrassment i have repeatedly pointed out the obvious mistake in organisation of jumbling together and practically everyone in the house is agreed upon this the functions of defence with those of a minister of supply the proper organisation let me repeat is four departments the navy the army the air and the ministry of supply with the minister for the coordination of defence over the four exercising a general supervision concerting their actions and assigning the high priorities of manufacture in relation to some comprehensive strategic conception the house is familiar with the many requests and arguments which have been made to the government to create a ministry of supply these arguments have received powerful reinforcement from another angle in the report the royal commission on arms manufacture the first work of this new parliament and the first work of the minister for the coordination of defence if he had known as much about the subject when he was appointed as he does now would have been to set up a ministry of supply which should step by step have taken over the whole business of the design and manufacture of all the supplies needed by the air force and the army and everything needed for the navy except warships heavy ordnance torpedoes and one or two ancillaries all the best of the industries of britain should have been surveyed from a general integral standpoint and all existing resources utilised so far as was necessary to execute the programme the minister for the coordination of defence has argued as usual against a ministry of supply the arguments which he used were weighty and even ponderous it would disturb and delay existing programmes it would do more harm than good it would upset the life and industry of the country it would destroy the export trade and demoralise finance at the moment when it was most needed it would turn this country into one vast munitions camp certainly these are massive arguments if they are true one would have thought that they would carry conviction to any man who accepted them but then my right hon friend went on somewhat surprisingly to say the decision is not final it would be reviewed again in a few weeks what will you know in a few weeks about this matter that you do not know now that you ought not to have known a year ago and have not been told any time in the last six months what is going to happen in the next few weeks which will invalidate all these magnificent arguments by which you have been overwhelmed and suddenly make it worth your while to paralyse the export trade to destroy the finances and to turn the country into a great munitions camp the first lord of the admiralty in his speech the other night went even farther he said we are always reviewing the position everything he assured us is entirely fluid i am sure that that is true anyone can see what the position is the government simply can not make up their minds or they can not get the prime minister to make up his mind so they go on in strange paradox decided only to be undecided resolved to be irresolute adamant for drift solid for fluidity allpowerful to be impotent so we go on preparing more months and years precious perhaps vital to the greatness of britain for the locusts to eat they will say to me a minister of supply is not necessary for all is going well i deny it the position is satisfactory it is not true all is proceeding according to plan we know what that means let me come to the territorial army in march of this year i stigmatised a sentence in the war office memorandum about the territorial army in which it was said the equipment of the territorials could not be undertaken until that of the regular army had been completed what has been done about all that it is certain the evils are not yet removed i agree wholeheartedly with all that was said by lord winterton the other day about the army and the territorial force when i think how these young men who join the territorials come forward almost alone in the population and take on a liability to serve anywhere in any part of the world not even with a guarantee to serve in their own units come forward in spite of every conceivable deterrent come forward 140000 of them although they are still not up to strength and then find that the government does not take their effort seriously enough even to equip and arm them properly i marvel at their patriotism it is a marvel it is also a glory but a glory we have no right to profit by unless we can secure proper and efficient equipment for them a friend of mine the other day saw a number of persons engaged in peculiar evolutions genuflections and gestures in the neighbourhood of london his curiosity was excited he wondered whether it was some novel form of gymnastics or a new religion there are new religions which are very popular in some countries nowadays or whether they were a party of lunatics out for an airing on approaching closer he learned that they were a searchlight company of london territorials who were doing their exercises as well as they could without having the searchlights yet we are told there is no need for a ministry of supply in the manoeuvres of the regular army many of the most important new weapons have to be represented by flags and discs when we remember how small our land forces are altogether only a few hundred thousand men it seems incredible that the very flexible industry of britain if properly handled could not supply them with their modest requirements in italy whose industry is so much smaller whose wealth and credit are a small fraction of this countrys a dictator is able to boast that he has bayonets and equipment for 8000000 men halve the figure if you like and the moral remains equally cogent the army lacks almost every weapon which is required for the latest form of modern war where are the antitank guns where are the shortdistance wireless sets where the field antiaircraft guns against lowflying armoured aeroplanes we want to know how it is that this country with its enormous motoring and motorbicycling public is not able to have strong mechanised divisions both regular and territorial surely when so much of the interest and the taste of our youth is moving in those mechanical channels and when the horse is receding with the days of chivalry into the past it ought to be possible to create an army of the size we want fully up to strength and mechanised to the highest degree look at the tank corps the tank was a british invention this idea which has revolutionised the conditions of modern war was a british idea forced on the war office by outsiders let me say they would have just as hard work today to force a new idea on it i speak from what i know during the war we had almost a monopoly let alone the leadership in tank warfare and for several years afterwards we held the foremost place to england all eyes were turned all that has gone now nothing has been done in the years that the locust hath eaten to equip the tank corps with new machines the medium tank which they possess which in its day was the best in the world is now looking obsolete not only in numbers for there we have never tried to compete with other countries but in quality these british weapons are now surpassed by those of germany russia italy and the united states all the shell plants and gun plants in the army apart from the very small peacetime services are in an elementary stage a very long period must intervene before any effectual flow of munitions can be expected even for the small forces of which we dispose still we are told there is no necessity for a ministry of supply no emergency which should induce us to impinge on the normal course of trade if we go on like this and i do not see what power can prevent us from going on like this some day there may be a terrible reckoning and those who take the responsibility so entirely upon themselves are either of a hardy disposition or they are incapable of foreseeing the possibilities which may arise now i come to the greatest matter of all the air we received on tuesday night from the first lord of the admiralty the assurance that there is no foundation whatever for the statement that we are vastly behind hand with our air force programme it is clear from his words that we are behind hand the only question is what meaning does the first lord attach to the word vastly he also used the expression about the progress of air expansion that it was not unsatisfactory one does not know what his standard is his standards change from time to time in that speech of the 11th of september about the league of nations there was one standard and in the hoarelaval pact there was clearly another in august last some of us went in a deputation to the prime minister in order to express the anxieties which we felt about national defence and to make a number of statements which we preferred not to be forced to make in public i personally made a statement on the state of the air force to the preparation of which i had devoted several weeks and which i am sorry to say took an hour to read my right hon friend the prime minister listened with his customary exemplary patience i think i told him beforehand that he is a good listener and perhaps he will retort that he learned to be when i was his colleague at any rate he listened with patience and that is always something during the three months that have passed since then i have checked those facts again in the light of current events and later acknowledge and were it not that foreign ears listen to all that is said here or if we were in secret session i would repeat my statement here and even if only one half were true i am sure the house would consider that a very grave state of emergency existed and also i regret to say a state of things from which a certain suspicion of mismanagement can not be excluded i am not going into any of those details i make it a rule as far as i possibly can to say nothing in this house upon matters which am not sure are already known to the general staffs of foreign countries but there is one statement of very great importance which the minister for the coordination of defence made in his speech on tuesday he said the process of building up squadrons and forming new training units and skeleton squadrons is familiar to everybody connected with the air force the number of squadrons in present circumstances at home today is eighty and that figure includes sixteen auxiliary squadrons but excludes the fleet air arm and of course does not include the squadrons abroad from that figure and the reservations by which it was prefaced it is possible for the house and also for foreign countries to deduce pretty accurately the progress of our air force expansion i feel therefore at liberty to comment on it parliament was promised a total of seventy one new squadrons making a total of 124 squadrons in the home defence force by 31 march 1937 this was thought to be the minimum compatible with our safety at the end of the last financial year our strength was fifty three squadrons including auxiliary squadrons therefore in the thirty two weeks which have passed since the financial year began we have added twenty eight squadrons that is to say less than one new squadron each week in order to make the progress which parliament was promised in order to maintain the programme which was put forward as the minimum we shall have to add forty three squadrons in the remaining twenty weeks or over two squadrons a week the rate at which new squadrons will have to be formed from now till the end of march will have to be nearly three times as fast as hitherto i do not propose to analyse the composition of the eighty squadrons we now have but the minister in his speech used a suggestive expression skeleton squadrons applying at least to a portion of them but even if every one of the eighty squadrons had an average strength of twelve aeroplanes each fitted with war equipment and the reserves upon which my right hon friend dwelt we should only have a total of 960 firstline homedefence aircraft what is the comparable german strength i am not going to give an estimate and say that the germans have not got more than a certain number but i will take it upon myself to say that they most certainly at this moment have not got less than a certain number most certainly they have not got less than 1500 firstline aeroplanes comprised in not less than 130 or 140 squadrons including auxiliary squadrons it must also be remembered that germany has not got in its squadrons any machine the design and construction of which is more than three years old it must also be remembered that germany has specialised in longdistance bombing aeroplanes and that her preponderance in that respect is far greater than any of these figures would suggest we were promised most solemnly by the government that air parity with germany would be maintained by the home defence forces at the present time putting everything at the very best we are upon the figures given by the minister for the coordination of defence only about twothirds as strong as the german air force assuming that i am not very much under stating their present strength how then does the first lord of the admiralty sir samuel hoare think it right to say on the whole our forecast of the strength of other air forces proves to be accurate on the other hand our own estimates have also proved to be accurate i am authorised to say that the position is satisfactory i simply can not understand it perhaps the prime minister will explain the position i should like to remind the house that i have made no revelation affecting this country and that i have introduced no new fact in our air defence which does not arise from the figures given by the minister and from the official estimates that have been published what ought we to do i know of only one way in which this matter can be carried further the house ought to demand a parliamentary inquiry it ought to appoint six seven or eight independent members responsible experienced discreet members who have some acquaintance with these matters and are representative of all parties to interview ministers and to find out what are in fact the answers to a series of questions then to make a brief report to the house whether of reassurance or of suggestion for remedying the shortcomings that i think is what any parliament worthy of the name would do in these circumstances parliaments of the past days in which the greatness of our country was abuilding would never have hesitated they would have felt they could not discharge their duty to their constituents if they did not satisfy themselves that the safety of the country was being effectively maintained the french parliament through its committees has a very wide deep knowledge of the state of national defence and i am not aware that their secrets leak out in any exceptional way there is no reason why our secrets should leak out in any exceptional way it is because so many members of the french parliament are associated in one way or another with the progress of the national defence that the french government were induced to supply six years ago upward of £60000000 sterling to construct the maginot line of fortifications when our government was assuring them that wars were over and that france must not lag behind britain in her disarmament even now i hope that members of the house of commons will rise above considerations of party discipline and will insist upon knowing where we stand in a matter which affects our liberties and our lives i should have thought that the government and above all the prime minister whose load is so heavy would have welcomed such a suggestion owing to past neglect in the face of the plainest warnings we have now entered upon a period of danger greater than has befallen britain since the uboat campaign was crushed perhaps indeed it is a more grievous period than that because at that time at least we were possessed of the means of securing ourselves and of defeating that campaign now we have no such assurance the era of procrastination of halfmeasures of soothing and baffling expedients of delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences we have entered a period in which for more than a year or a year and a half the considerable preparations which are now on foot in britain will not as the minister clearly showed yield results which can be effective in actual fighting strength while during this very period germany may well reach the culminating point of her gigantic military preparations and be forced by financial and economic stringency to contemplate a sharp decline or perhaps some other exit from her difficulties it is this lamentable conjunction of events which seems to present the danger of europe in its most disquieting form we can not avoid this period we are in it now surely if we can abridge it by even a few months if we can shorten this period when the german army will begin to be so much larger than the french army and before the british air force has come to play its complementary part we may be the architects who build the peace of the world on sure foundations two things i confess have staggered me after a long parliamentary experience in these debates the first has been the dangers that have so swiftly come upon us in a few years and have been transforming our position and the whole outlook of the world secondly i have been staggered by the failure of the house of commons to react effectively against those dangers that i am bound to say i never expected i never would have believed that we should have been allowed to go on getting into this plight month by month and year by year and that even the governments own confessions of error would have produced no concentration of parliamentary opinion and force capable of lifting our efforts to the level of emergency i say that unless the house resolves to find out the truth for itself it will have committed an act of abdication of duty without parallel in its long history the main index search the web site contact the society to become a member of the churchill

courage to march for justice it is a story of dreams deferred and justice long denied a family saga of grandfathers marching alongside their grandchildren and a struggle for freedom consecrated by the blood of martyrs bernard lafayette was only 22 years old when he was chosen by the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc to be the director of its alabama voter registration campaign in january 1963 yet even at this young age lafayette already had become a seasoned activist after being arrested two years earlier in 1960 during the restaurant sitins organized by the nashville student movement a nonviolent campaign to integrate public facilities that ignited the idealism of a new generation and spread like wildfire through the deep south then one year after the nashville sitins came the next milestone on his road to selma in 1961 lafayette decided to become a freedom rider perhaps the single most dangerous calling a young activist could answer he provides a harrowing account of being brutally beaten by a mob of white racists who attacked a busload of freedom riders at the montgomery bus station in may 1961 yet lafayette is always the indefatigable teacher of nonviolence selflessly teaching its lessons to a new generation instead of drawing attention to his own accomplishments so instead of focusing on his own dedication in facing the horrific assaults on the freedom riders his real message is to teach us how nonviolent activists can face overwhelming levels of physical violence and still keep their spirits intact and their movement alive in the montgomery bus station a ranting mob viciously attacked us several of us were severely beaten however we defied all expectations we didnt run we didnt fight back we got back up when slammed to the ground and looked our attackers directly in the eyes fighting violence with nonviolence in spite of our injuries with many of us bleeding and battered we got back on the bus and continued our ride toward jackson in peace and freedom p 11 selma the most hostile city far from being deterred by the violent attacks that battered the freedom riders the young activist was more determined than ever to put the nonviolent teachings of martin luther king and james lawson into practice in one of the most hostile and intolerant of southern cities — selma alabama selma was considered so dangerous and implacably racist that the sncc leadership had totally written it off as an impossible area to organize when lafayette asked james forman the executive secretary of sncc to appoint him as director of the voter registration campaign in selma he was told that sncc had just removed selma from the list of possible organizing sites after two groups of sncc workers had returned from scouting the city and reported the white folks are too mean and the black folks are too afraid yet lafayette remained dedicated to putting the teachings of nonviolence to work in a city where they would meet the toughest test imaginable forman finally relented and appointed him director of the voter registration campaign in selma as soon as he arrived in selma in january 1963 lafayette began bringing together an embryonic organization of selma residents to carry out a systematic voter registration campaign that only two years later would literally transform the face of a nation when it catalyzed the passage of the voting rights act of 1965 the tristate assassination conspiracy yet lafayettes central role in this momentous struggle was almost erased at the beginning of his selma sojourn on june 12 1963 the same day that legendary civil rights leader medgar evers was assassinated in jackson mississippi dr lafayette and rev benjamin cox a leading organizer for core congress of racial equality in new orleans were also targeted in coordinated assassination plots even though the murder of medgar evers is now enshrined in the nations memory as a courageous sacrifice for the freedom movement the story of the two other intended victims who were targeted by murder plots is almost unknown lafayettes book offers a gripping firstperson account of the coordinated sameday murder plots that the fbi called the tristate conspiracy to assassinate three key civil rights leaders in mississippi alabama and louisiana this assassination conspiracy was carried out just hours after president john kennedy had given a major speech on national television in support of civil rights on june 12 on the same evening that evers was murdered by an assassin when he pulled into his carport at his home in jackson mississippi lafayette was attacked and nearly beaten to death when he returned home in his car after a voterregistration meeting in selma as he arrived home two white men in a nearby parked car asked him to give their stalled vehicle a push when the unsuspecting lafayette got out of his car to help the men they savagely attacked him without warning smashing his head with a crushing blow from a pistol butt that knocked him to the ground when he rose up and stood his ground refusing to run the attackers pounded his head with crushing blows again knocking him to the ground each time the men struck him lafayette stood up again refused to run or defend himself and looked his assailant in the eye but then the wouldbe assassins aimed a gun point blank at his face preparing to shoot the defenseless activist at that moment his neighbor red ran out and pointed a rifle at them lafayette hollered dont shoot him red adhering to nonviolence even at great risk to his own life lafayette stood between the two armed men with his arms outstretched the attackers jumped into their car and sped off and lafayette was taken to the hospital during the brutal assault lafayette said that he felt a sense of spiritual empowerment that allowed me to feel an extraordinary sense of internal strength instead of fear even though he was face to face with death he wrote i felt an intense force that seemed to lift me up emotionally even though i didnt know what would happen next it was a surrendering of life in a sense and i was prepared he realized that this surreal feeling had happened only twice in his life both times when he was under physical attack i view it as a form of resistance with support from a power beyond myself he wrote in peace and freedom p 75 a turning point in selma the nearly lethal violence directed against lafayette after he had only worked for a few months in selma seemed to confirm the initial decision by the sncc leadership to entirely avoid any campaign for civil rights in selma a lesser man — and a lesser movement — would have abandoned the entire organizing effort in selma right then and there instead the assassination attempt boomeranged on the assailants the black community had been oppressed for so long by threats of terrible reprisals — fearing everything from the loss of jobs to the loss of their lives — that they were intimidated into being silent afraid to speak out publicly even for their right to vote the assassination plot seemingly confirmed all their worst fears yet it became a turning point in the struggle toward freedom lafayette explained the feelings of blacks in selma toward me changed after that night because they realized i was prepared to give my life for a cause that would serve them there was a different climate a new attitude people not only sympathized they offered genuine support he now found that many more people were committed to attending the mass meetings and voter registration classes and long lines of people began bravely standing up for their rights at the voter registration office where they willingly risked arrests and beatings by the notoriously brutal sheriff jim clark and his deputies sheriff clark and other selma officials wore buttons proclaiming never to show that they would never tolerate any attempts at integration and voter registration they drove their segregationist message home by violently attacking and arresting selma citizens as they peacefully attempted to register to vote yet hundreds of people from all walks of life found the courage to challenge sheriff clark and the brutal apparatus of segregation this is the boomerang effect of nonviolence that gus newport of the national council of elders has described this boomerang effect has made an unexpected appearance in many seemingly hopeless nonviolent campaigns when an oppressed people suddenly discover the spirit of resistance rising from within at the very moment when the authorities have attempted to destroy a movement with violent repression too many martyrs mural depicting rev james reeb jimmie lee jackson murdered in selma artist unknown courtesy uucsjorg medgar evers is now revered as a legendary hero of the freedom movement as the mississippi field secretary for the naacp evers had defied several assassination threats and kept working fearlessly for civil rights until he was shot in the back at his home in jackson by a riflebearing member of the white citizens council and the ku klux klan byron de la beckwith in the years since his death medgar evers has been honored in movies and books and songs his memory and legacy have been celebrated at arlington national cemetery and a memorial statue of the slain civil rights icon was erected in jackson mississippi in june 2013 bob dylan honored evers in the song only a pawn in their game dylan sang today medgar evers was buried from the bullet he caught they lowered him down as a king the folksinger phil ochs deeply committed to the cause of civil rights as a musician and an activist wrote an anthem too many martyrs with an unforgettable description of evers murder he slowly squeezed the trigger the bullet left his side it struck the heart of every man when evers fell and died core activist rev benjamin cox avoided assassination because he just happened to have traveled out of new orleans that fateful night that chance trip saved his life lafayette writes rev cox had been arrested many times for organizing sitins that succeeded in integrating several restaurants including mcdonalds in may 1961 cox and 12 other activists became the original freedom riders riding the bus from washington dc to new orleans after the fbi told cox and lafayette that they had been targeted in the tristate conspiracy that claimed evers life the two men realized they had escaped death by the narrowest of margins with a grim sense of gallows humor lafayette wrote weve been friends for many years and sometimes cox sends me a deathday card instead of a birthday card yet even as the black community in selma found new reservoirs of courage and commitment in the wake of the assassination attempt on lafayette the 16th street baptist church in nearby birmingham alabama was bombed on september 15 1963 by the ku klux klan killing four young girls attending sunday school and injuring hundreds more only two months later president john f kennedy was assassinated in dallas on november 22 1963 the twin tragedies threatened to tear the heart out of the movement lafayette wrote the people in selma had been hopeful with kennedy and they were now filled with a profound sorrow and grief having lost an influential supporter of the civil rights movement beyond the overwhelming grief came the unsettling realization that violence could strike down anyone at any moment in the struggle for freedom many of us felt that if the most powerful leaders in the world could not be protected then the common person particularly black persons certainly had no protection at all in peace and freedom p 104 the magnificent movement and that is when the movement rose up and magnificently met the challenge people persevered in spite of the deaths of innocent young girls in church they persevered in the face of the assassinations of medgar evers and president kennedy in the face of death threats and bombings and the savage brutality of selma sheriff jim clark the movement defied all expectations and grew stronger in commitment nonviolent resistance has been defined as a spirit of relentless perseverance lafayette watched as that spirit of perseverance emerged in selma we considered ourselves soldiers in a nonviolent army and would continue to fight against violent acts with nonviolence violence was never a deterrent for us we believed that if we sustained the movement in spite of the violence we would succeed and bring about the changes we sought due to the neversaydie courage displayed by thousands of people from all walks of life selma became one of the most significant battlegrounds in the struggle to win civil rights and voting rights for an entire nation it is customary in our culture to believe that history is made by generals presidents and powerful corporate leaders in selma alabama and throughout the deep south the common people rewrote the history books the courage of ordinary people turned out to be the most essential ingredient in overcoming a systematic form of racist discrimination that had for decades prevented nearly all black citizens from being allowed to vote bloody sunday in selma on march 7 1965 more than 600 nonviolent marchers were viciously assaulted when alabama state and local police attacked the first attempt to march from selma to montgomery in support of voting rights troops on horseback chased the peaceful marchers and many were brutally beaten by mounted police savagely swinging whips and batons while others were trampled by horses bloody sunday is now an iconic moment in the legacy of the freedom movement hundreds suffered bloody beatings and some were clubbed nearly to death as police used billy clubs and tear gas to disrupt the march amelia boynton lafayettes closest personal ally and one of the most courageous supporters of the voting rights campaign in selma was severely beaten knocked down to the asphalt and hospitalized yet lafayette concludes his account of bloody sunday with a remarkable passage about how nonviolence can succeed at the very moment when it seems brutalized and beaten down he wrote an objective analysis would conclude that the protesters were defeated however from the songs in their souls one could hear victory and victory it was as this march referred to as bloody sunday because of the bloodshed increased the awareness of the important issue part of our strategy was to make the nation aware of the conditions people were suffering when they protested about their right to vote when the national audience saw the horrors the national conscience was awakened a nation is galvanized bloody sunday was perhaps the bloodiest encounter of the entire civil rights movement it shocked and galvanized a nation president lyndon johnson had already signed the civil rights act of 1964 and then shut the door on any further civil rights legislation just prior to the selma brutality lbj had said that he was not willing to spend any more political capital on pushing federal laws to defend voting rights so it is all the more remarkable that as a direct result of bloody sunday lyndon johnson signed the voting rights act of 1965 which ensured voting rights for black citizens and banned racial discrimination at the polls many analysts and historians consider the voting rights act to be the most significant and powerful legislation for civil rights certainly the price was paid in full and not only by those beaten nearly to death by alabama police martyrs paid a more permanent price jimmie lee jackson age 26 a nonviolent protester who marched for voting rights along with his grandfather mother and sister was shot to death by alabama state police in february 1965 this shocking murder of an innocent unarmed young man sparked the famous selma to montgomery march immediately after bloody sunday viola liuzzo was shot to death and rev james reeb was beaten to death by white racists and ku klux klan members the deaths ignited a nation on march 15 1965 only eight days after bloody sunday president johnson delivered a special message asking congress to pass the voting rights act johnson called selma a turning point in humanitys search for freedom johnson said there longsuffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as americans many were brutally assaulted one good man a man of god was killed there is no cause for pride in what has happened in selma there is no cause for selfsatisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of americans selma was actually an historic showdown in three acts bloody sunday occurred on march 7 1965 when the police brutalized hundreds of marchers on the edmund pettus bridge the second march was held only two days later on march 9 hundreds of marchers crossed the edmund pettus bridge and the entire crowd knelt down in prayer with martin luther king and ralph david abernathy in what they called a confrontation of prayer many were very critical that the marchers then turned around and walked back across the bridge instead of continuing on and provoking a mass arrest in lafayettes analysis these critics didnt understand what the real purpose of that march was the organizers were waiting in expectation that the federal government was on the verge of lifting an injunction against the right to march they held the second march to keep the heat and the media glare on the city of selma but they wanted to avoid an unwanted unnecessary and irrelevant battle with the federal government at a time when they were pressuring federal officials to overturn alabamas local laws that prevented black people from voting the organizers had analyzed things correctly the federal injunction was indeed lifted only 10 days after the second march and the third and final march was scheduled for march 21 1965 now the battle lines were clear it was the freedom movement versus alabama officials — from gov george wallace on down to sheriff jim clark — who had illegally prevented black citizens from voting for decades on march 21 the third march to montgomery began in selma and five days later a large group of marchers reached montgomery and held a massive rally of 25000 people on the steps of the alabama state capitol how long not long at the culmination of the rally martin luther king delivered the historic how long not long speech in montgomery — fittingly in the city where he had first become pastor of a congregation and the site of the first significant civil rights campaign the montgomery bus boycott king asked how long will justice be crucified and truth bear it i come to say to you this afternoon however difficult the moment however frustrating the hour it will not be long because truth crushed to earth will rise again how long not long because no lie can live forever how long not long because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice if the selma campaign was the best of times it was also the worst of times it was the best of times because as a direct result of the selma to montgomery marches president johnson and the us congress passed the voting rights act and ripped up many of the jim crow laws that prevented black citizens from voting it was the worst of times because viola liuzzo a civil rights activist and mother of five was shot to death by a carload of ku klux klan members as she was ferrying marchers between montgomery and selma after the rally lafayette knew liuzzo as a selfless activist for justice he wrote theres not a time that i drive past the monument that marks the area where she was killed that i dont reflect on that tragic night and say a silent prayer for her and for the family she left behind in peace and freedom p 141 lafayette says he has mixed emotions whenever he thinks about liuzzo and all those who gave their lives so selflessly for the cause of justice yet he always remembers how she sacrificed her life so that others might live and enjoy freedom and democracy in their own nation those words are a testament as to how we should remember and honor those who gave their lives to win one of the most important struggles in our nations history we must remember medgar evers jimmie lee jackson viola liuzzo rev james reeb martin luther king jr and the four girls killed in birmingham addie mae collins denise mcnair carole robertson and cynthia wesley i remember now and always how an oppressed and insulted people a people subjected to a nearly totalitarian system of racism enforced by overwhelming levels of statesanctioned violence found the courage to march on with all the odds against them march on despite the beatings and bombings and bloodshed march on despite the murders they refused to

            "body": "aaas global warming what we know abrawang open salon ive never been one for the snip type of post where most of it is quotes from other sources but im making an exception this time as i believe that global warming caused by human activity is about the gravest threat facing humanity especially for anyone whose life expectancy from this point on exceeds a quarter century first off who or what is the aaas they are the american association for the advancement of science here is wikis summary an international nonprofit organization with the stated goals of promoting cooperation among scientists defending scientific freedom encouraging scientific responsibility and supporting scientific education and science outreach for the betterment of all humanity it is the worlds largest and most prestigious general scientific society with 126995 individual and institutional members at the end of 20081 and is the publisher of the wellknown scientific journal science which has a weekly circulation of 138549 in early 2014 the aaas issued a report called what we know – the reality risks and response to climate change its aim was to address the fact that many americans still erroneously believe that the scientific community is divided on the issue and that americans are largely unaware of the full spectrum of climate risks – both what is likely to happen and what might happen — that humancaused climate change presents to americans now and in the future not counting the footnotes and citations its an 18 page double spaced big fonts report that ive linked to above anyone who has any interest in the subject and everyone ought to should take the five or ten minutes to read what the vast majority of scientists who study the topic have concluded here are some highlights the numbering is mine for ease of reference 1 the overwhelming evidence of human caused climate change documents both current impacts with significant costs and extraordinary future risks to society and natural systems the scientific community has convened conferences published reports spoken out at forums and proclaimed through statements by virtually every national scientific academy and relevant major scientific organization — including the american association for the advancement of science aaas —that climate change puts the wellbeing of people of all nations at risk 2 surveys show that many americans think climate change is still a topic of significant scientific disagreement thus it is important and increasingly urgent for the public to know there is now a high degree of agreement among climate scientists that humancaused climate change is real 3 many people do not yet understand that there is a small but real chance of abrupt unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes with highly damaging impacts on people in the united states and around the world in other words there is no significant scientific dispute that the climate is changing and that human activity is the cause further many nonscientists do not know this heres more 4 based on wellestablished evidence about 97 of climate scientists have concluded that humancaused climate change is happening this agreement is documented not just by a single study but by a converging stream of evidence over the past two decades from surveys of scientists content analyses of peerreviewed studies and public statements issued by virtually every membership organization of experts in this field 5 average global temperature has increased by about 14 ìš f over the last 100 years sea level is rising and some types of extreme events – such as heat waves and heavy precipitation events are happening more frequently recent scientific findings indicate that climate change is likely responsible for the increase in the intensity of many of these events in recent years there have been multiple studies in multiple fields by a wide group of scientists and the conclusions point in the same direction 6 earths climate is on a path to warm beyond the range of what has been experienced over the past millions of years a favorite denier argument is that there have always been fluctuations in the earths temperature that there are natural cycles and this one if it is really happening is no different than what has gone before for this to make sense you have to believe that the many thousands of scientists who study climate change are unaware of historical cycles or that unlike the sages of bloggersville have given them undue weight in fact what the scientists find alarming is that the rate of temperature increase is unprecedented what once happened over hundreds of thousands of years has now happened in a century 7 as global temperatures rise there is a real risk however small that one or more critical parts of the earths climate system will experience abrupt unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes 8 the co2 we produce accumulates in earths atmosphere for decades centuries and longer it is not like pollution from smog or wastes in our lakes and rivers where levels respond quickly to the effects of targeted policies the effects of co2 emissions can not be reversed from one generation to the next until there is a largescale costeffective way to scrub carbon dioxide from the atmosphere moreover as emissions continue and warming increases the risk increases theres a real though hard to quantify risk that temperatures could zoom up this refers to things like a permafrost melt and a more rapid melt of the icecaps the former would accelerate global warming as methane is part of the permafrost and has a stronger greenhouse effect than co2 the latter would raise sea levels well beyond average projections thereby destroying most coastal cities 9 in 2013 only 42 of american adults understood that most scientists think global warming is happening and 33 said there is a lot of disagreement among scientists about whether or not global warming is happening 10 so let us be clear based on wellestablished evidence about 97 of climate scientists conclude humans are changing the climate 11 the evidence is overwhelming levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are rising temperatures are going up springs are arriving earlier ice sheets are melting sea level is rising the patterns of rainfall and drought are changing heat waves are getting worse as is extreme precipitation the oceans are acidifying 12 greenhouse gases from manmade sources such as smokestacks and tailpipes have altered our climate system greenhouse gases have supercharged the climate just as steroids supercharged hitting in major league baseball over the course of a baseball season in the steroid era we witnessed more–and longer–homers even though we can not attribute any specific homer to steroids similarly even though we can not attribute any particular weather event to climate change some types of extreme events such as heat waves are now more frequent their rebuttal to the disinformation from petroleum industry front groups and much of the right wing medias efforts to confuse the issue 13 after remaining relatively stable at around 280 parts per million ppm for millennia carbon dioxide co2 began to rise in the 19 th century as people burned fossil fuels in everincreasing amounts this upward trend continues today with concentrations breaking the 400 ppm mark just last year the rate of increase during the last 100 to 150 years has been much more rapid than in other periods of the earths history the warming effect of co2 and other heattrapping gases is wellestablished and can be demonstrated with simple science experiments and satellite observations this almost reads as talking down unfortunately given the levels of ignorance it is necessary 14 decades of humangenerated greenhouse gases are now the major force driving the direction of climate change currently overwhelming the effects of these other factors many studies show that the combined effects of natural drivers of climate can not explain the temperature increase observed over the past this in rebuttal to the deniers claim that volcanos the earths orbit solar variations and other natural factors can account for current warming 15 arctic sea ice has been shrinking dramatically and the rate of loss is accelerating in september 2012 arctic summer sea ice fell to a new record low at half the historical average a loss in area nearly twice the size of alaska 16 the oceans are absorbing much of the co2 that smokestacks and tailpipes emit into the atmosphere as a result the oceans are rapidly acidifying with early impacts on shelled organisms such as oysters already documented the current acidification rate is likely the fastest in 300 million years 17 as the world has gotten hotter many of the worlds plants and animals on land and in the oceans have begun moving toward the poles 18 over the last two decades sea levels have risen almost twice as fast as the average during the 20 th century salt water intrusion can be witnessed in southern florida where sea level rise is contributing to salt water infiltration of coastal wells some examples of global warming effects already happening the paper cites several more 19 given the high stakes it is valuable to understand not just what is most likely to happen but what might possibly happen to our climate there is a possibility that temperatures will rise much higher and impacts will be much worse than expected moreover as global temperature rises the risk increases that one or more important parts of the earths climate system will experience changes that may be abrupt unpredictable and potentially irreversible causing large damages and high costs the precautionary principle here theres little doubt it will get worse but it might get unimaginably worse and the italics and highlighting are theirs the report has a section on risk where it makes the point that we try to minimize everyday risk in a variety of ways 20 we buckle our seat belts latch our kids into car seats and buy insurance for a host of unlikely but serious possibilities such as losing our homes or belongings to theft fire or flood we dont think these things will happen but we can not be sure they wont uncertainty means risk much of our daytoday risk management is to lessen the danger directly for example we purchase cars with the latest safety devices and use these 21 consider the example of a seaside community in florida there are three futures to consider even under the most optimistic scenario very aggressive greenhouse gas reductions and minimal melting sea level is projected to rise about one foot this century the middleoftheroad projection for the current pathway is about two feet this is a fairly likely possibility the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates the probability of a sea level rise of 2 to 3 feet to be more than about 60 but the tail risk projection as forecast by the us national climate assessment sees the community contending with a sea level rise of close to seven feet in other words the chances of only a one foot rise are about the same as a seven foot one here are more worstcase points 22 according to the ipcc given the current pathway for carbon emissions the high end of the likely range for the expected increase in global temperature is about 8 ìš f by the end of the century this is similar to the roughly 9° f warming that ended the last ice age it is important to remember that temperature change due to co2 emissions is essentially irreversible for several hundred years since this co2 is removed from the atmosphere only very slowly by natural processes 23 sea level rise projections over the next century vary considerably with the highend scenarios yielding a rise of up to 6 or 7 feet by 2100 about 7 to 8 million people in the us live within 6 feet of the local high tide line and storm surge can extend flooding far beyond the high tide line as witnessed in superstorm sandy coastal flooding events that currently occur once every 100 years will occur much more frequently possibly as often as yearly for many locations rendering many cities and communities uninhabitable as is 24 pushing global temperatures past certain thresholds could trigger abrupt unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes that have massively disruptive and largescale impacts at that point even if we do not add any additional co2 to the atmosphere potentially unstoppable processes are set in motion we can think of this as sudden climate brake and steering failure where the problem and its consequences are no longer something we can control in climate terms abrupt change means change occurring over periods as short as decades or even years several fairly awful scenarios are laid out and as ive already quoted a lot ill just list the sections ecosystem collapse arctic sea ice collapse large scale ice sheet collapse destabilizing of sea floor methane permafrost melt the next section makes the obvious point that the sooner we act the lower the risk and the cost and they close on a positive note citing the collective actions taken to combat acid rain and the ozone hole however id note that unlike turning off the spigot for those two the carbon already pumped into the atmosphere will remain there for decades and were nowhere close to the consensus and international agreements necessary for reducing carbon emissions addendum in point 21 theres a reference to the intergovernmental panel on climate change its an organization under the united nations and acts as a clearing house of published peerreviewed scientific work around the world from time to time it issues its own reports summarizing the state of science as it related to greenhouse gases and their effect on climate their webpage is here and they recently released two papers – climate change 2014 impacts adaptation and vulnerability which is similar to the aaass paper and the other – climate change 2014 mitigation of climate change lays out ways in which carbon emissions might be reduced but incidentally shows just how difficult that will be both papers are currently shown on the ipccs front page anyone who takes this threat seriously and given the overwhelming scientific consensus that should be everyone should be lobbying policy makers at all levels to take these findings seriously and to make the reduction of carbon emissions a top priority that also means combatting the disinformation put forward by the petroleum industry and their various front and astroturf groups good luck with that",

marks two years since oswaldo payá sardiñas and harold cepero escalante were last seen alive before a car crash at 150pm est on july 22 2012 the sunday afternoon incident involved a second vehicle driven by cuban state security the moment that i learned of what happened is burned into my memory as if it were yesterday in the two years since the payá family and members of the christian liberation movement have sought through all channels available to push for an international investigation into the deaths of these two activists the washington post editorial board on the eve of the two year anniversary published what is now known publicly the car spun out of control after being rammed from behind by a vehicle bearing state license plates according to mr carromero while he and the associate from sweden survived mr payá and mr cepero were killed mr carromero says he was then coerced to confess and subjected to a rigged trial in order to cover up what really happened mr carromeros videotaped confession broadcast on television was forced upon him he was told to read from cards written by the state security officers he was sentenced to four years in prison for vehicular homicide and later released to return to spain to serve out his term the cover up of this extrajudicial killing carried out by the cuban state security service has crumbled eventually a regional or international human rights body will produce a credible and independent report on the events that transpired on july 22 2012 and hold the cuban government responsible the facts surrounding what happened are in the public domain so can be legally analyzed and judged based on their merits respected international leaders nobel prize winners desmond tutu and lech walesa among them have called for an international investigation it wont be the first time nine days ago the world marked 20 years since the attack and sinking of the 13 de marzo tugboat on july 13 1994 that claimed 37 lives there was an investigation on the merits the interamerican commission on human rights in a report released on october 16 1996 concluded that what transpired that early morning was not an accident but rather a premeditated intentional act by agents of the cuban government they hold the cuban state responsible for violating the right to life of all the people who were shipwrecked and perished as a result of the sinking of the 13 de marzo these events occurred just seven miles off the cuban coast on july 13 1994 nevertheless two decades later the men responsible despite being identified have not been held accountable in a court of law three years later the interamerican commission on human rights on september 29 1999 released a report on the february 24 1996 brotherstotherescue shoot down they concluded that cuba is responsible for violating the right to life to the detriment of carlos costa pablo morales mario de la peña and armando alejandre who died as a result of the direct actions of its agents on the afternoon of 24 february 1996 while flying through international airspace the cuban state lost a civil judgement to the families of the victims in us courts a cuban spy gerardo hernandez was also arrested in 1998 and sentenced to life in prison for conspiracy to commit murder for his role nevertheless the men who gave the orders and pressed the trigger that blew two civilian planes out of the sky have yet to be held accountable in a court of law in the meantime cubans and friends of freedom around the world are remembering the legacy of oswaldo payá sardiñas and harold cepero escalante masses are planned in havana madrid and miami to give thanks for their lives and their nonviolent legacy that continues to demonstrate that love is stronger than hate across social media people of goodwill are making the sign of liberation and displaying two candles in memory of oswaldo and harold despite harassment and death threats against the payá family that forced them to seek refuge in exile and rising repression — including machete attacks against members of the christian liberation movement — the movement has continued on the island to carry on oswaldos legacy of nonviolent resistance the payá family and the christian liberation movement in the diaspora have continued together to support their counterparts in cuba and lead the struggle for justice for oswaldo and harold it is said that justice delayed is justice denied and where a statue of limitations is involved that may be true but when it comes to murder only a few countries such as colombia and until recently japan have an end date to pursue murderers cuba does not have such a provision in the case of the czech republic one of the most notorious cases is that of milada horakova she was hanged with three others in pragues pankrac prison as a spy and traitor to the communist czechoslovakian government on june 27 1950 after a show trial that same prosecutor who presided over the show trial faced trial for murder 57 years later and was found guilty and jailed reverend king is right the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice history has already condemned these crimes and it is highly probable that a court of justice will eventually do so as well keep the faith do not despair and continue to show your solidarity with victims of repression",

            "body": "climate change a catalyst for conflict by tom revell may 14 2014 from blueandgreentomorrow website climate change is already acting as a catalyst for conflict and poses a serious risk to security according to a strongly worded call for action from a panel of former american generals and admirals the center for naval analysis corporation�s cna military advisory board report concludes that the impacts of climate change are increasing instability around the world even in the arctic it suggests that droughts caused by warming in the middle east and africa are leading to conflicts over food and water exacerbating preexisting tensions and creating an environment in which extremism and revolutionary influences can prosper in other regions rising sea levels will create millions of new refugees and migrants while increasingly frequent extreme whether events are expected to stretch the us military meanwhile in the melting arctic nations will compete to exploit newly accessible resources threatening not just the environment but also security overall the report upgrades climate change from a threat multiplier as it was labeled in cna�s 2007 report and a recent department of defense review to a catalyst for conflict political posturing and budgetary woes can not be allowed to inhibit discussion and debate over what so many believe to be a salient national security concern for our nation the report�s authors say time and tide wait for no one in a foreword former us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff and former secretary of defence leon panetta say the report serves as a bipartisan call for action in an interview with the new york times the us secretary of state john kerry said that the report would influence america�s foreign policy tribes are killing each other over water today he said think of what happens if you have massive dislocation or the drying up of the waters of the nile of the major rivers in china and india the intelligence community takes it seriously and it�s translated into action here is why us military thinks climate change is national security threat by susanne posel may 15 2014 from occupycorporatism website the center for naval analyses military advisory board cnamab released a report coauthored by several retired generals concerning the national security� threat climate change is to the environment authors of the study assert the biggest change in the seven years between the two studies was the increase in scientific certainty about global warming and of the link between global warming and security disruptions� climate change according to this document becomes a threat multiplier� which could enhance or contribute to already existing causes of global disruption� retired air force general charles wald said in the past the thinking was that climate change multiplied the significance of a situation now were saying its going to be a direct cause of instability the report states climate change can act as a threat multiplier for instability in some of the most volatile regions of the world and it presents significant national security challenges for the united states problems will be felt even in stable regions� authors of the report claim that the us military should plan to help manage catastrophes and conflicts both domestically and internationally raising concerns regarding a wave of refugees fleeing rising sea levels these effects are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty environmental degradation political instability and social tensions conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence� the cnamab asserts that us lawmakers must respond because the increasing risks from climate change will almost certainly get worse if we delay� this report states the climate change has and will continue to cause drought in the middle east and africa leading to conflicts over food and water and escalating longstanding regional and ethnic tensions into violent clashes� another concern of the authors is the rising sea levels that are putting people and food supplies in vulnerable coastal regions like eastern india bangladesh and the mekong delta in vietnam at risk and could lead to a new wave of refugees� john kerry secretary of state remarked tribes are killing each other over water today kerry said think of what happens if you have massive dislocation or the drying up of the waters of the nile of the major rivers in china and india the intelligence community takes it seriously and its translated into action kerry believes that this report will influence us foreign policy in the future in accord john conger deputy undersecretary of defense for installations and environment with the pentagon explained the department certainly agrees that climate change is having an impact on national security whether by increasing global instability by opening the arctic or by increasing sea level and storm surge near our coastal installations we are actively integrating climate considerations across the full spectrum of our activities to ensure a ready and resilient force last march admiral samuel j locklear commander of the us navy pacific operations sector voiced concern that manmade climate change is a real and viable threat to us national security with regard to possible nuclear engagement with north korea and the mounting observations of chinas detriment to the us in general locklear commented that global warming has the potential to cripple the security environment probably more likely than the other scenarios we all often talk about you have the real potential here in the nottoodistant future of nations displaced by rising sea level the us navy energy environment and climate change task force tfcc was created in 2009 to address the naval implications of a changing arctic and global environment� the tfcc is empowered to make recommendations to navy leadership regarding policy investment and action and to lead public discussion on this serious issue� while the tfcc is concerned about arctic ice melt sea levels resource challenges� and humanitarian assistance� with regard to disaster response� they consider the effects of ocean acidification on ecosystems abrupt climate change and geoengineering challenges� the document entitled us navy arctic roadmap� outlines how the us navy policy assists in governing investment action and public discussion regarding the arctic capitalizes on the navys extensive experience in the region and emphasizes cooperative partnerships in joint surveys research search and rescue maritime domain awareness and incident response� rajendra pachauri rajendra pachauri chairman of the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc retorts that if a successful action is not taken to stop climate change it will become a national and international security threat pachauri said if the impact of climate change is going to make regions of violence poorer then they really provide a level of fertility for inciting disaffection resentment against the prosperous world thats an indirect effect that can create the conditions for terrorism� recommendations to the us were were likely to have problems with respect to water supplies in the us we have to tell the people of the us that this is something intimately connected with their present and their future the cost of inaction is going to be far higher than action and the cost of action is really not all that high the us has made all kinds of sacrifices in the past and has always come out on top",

the inevitable hour grays elegy 1751 given prime minister lamothes attempts to permanently gag a us journalist who alleged corruption by lamothe should we be surprised if he and president martelly stand accused of tampering with the haitian judicial system in a case involving alleged corruption by martellys wife and son and of perjury in relation to a meeting with the investigating judge serge joseph shortly before his death we think not both go with an apparent authoritarian mindset furthermore among other things martellylamothe arrogantly ignored senate calls for transparency and public debate in relation to mining anyone who follows haiti even a little bit knows that the senate bears no love for martellylamothe so that their call for impeachment comes as no real surprise hence before we launch into their 30 page report we want to relate the account by haitis oldest daily le nouvelliste of an interview with judge josephs wife rachelle acelat we do not believe that anyone can fairly accuse her of using her husbands death for a political agenda she has no reason to lie thus her very damning description of the alleged meeting at gary lissades law office shortly prior to her husbands death should carry much weight rachelle acelat confirms the theory of the meeting le nouvelliste 8 august by roberson alphonse original french translation our own the tongue of rachelle

to prison in a country where there is rule of law continued rachelle acelat i believe that you told me that you had control of the judge who you gave the file to squealed martelly while addressing himself to the chief judge raymond jean michel who defended himself by saying that all was ok and that judge jean serge joseph had recently changed his mind disclosed rachelle acelat it was the chief judge raymond jean michel explained rachelle acelat who drove jean serge joseph to the meeting in his vehicle without escort and it was the chief judge who at the end of the meeting where it was decided to stay the appeal to the court of appeals to transfer the file to the criminal court who said to judge jean serge joseph that he could have a drink they gave him a glass of something to drink indicated rachelle acelat who had advised her spouse to drink his own urine in the event that he was thirsty the prime minister laurent s lamothe reproached judge joseph for not being a supporter of martelly it seems that you are looking to make a coup detat against the government accused laurent lamothe according to the testimony of rachelle acelat which constitutes a new development in this

minister raymond jean michel summoned joseph to the law offices of louis garry lissade declaring the president of the republic is offended by this measure of justice that you have taken he now must take drugs in order to sleep this statement was reported by madistin samuel attorney at law in portauprince and former senator in a denouncement made to the prosecutor at the court of first instance of portauprince on july 14 2013 mr lissade then urged judge joseph per the instruction of president martelly to review his july 2 order in a subsequent hearing despite the executives pressure judge joseph refused to overturn the july 2 order on thursday july 11 2013 upon further request of mr lissade the judge returned to mr lissades office escorted in mr raymond jean michels car president martelly who attended the meeting along with the prime minister the minister of justice and of public security and the president of the portauprince trial court ordered judge joseph to quash the case when the judge responded no arguing that the public prosecutor had already filed an official appeal and that he had relinquished his ability to do any more threats and insults rained down upon him witnesses recount that the judge was even struck in the face in front of everyone in the room httpwwwijdhorgwpcontentuploads201308iachrletteraug52013pdf this last is particularly interesting considering that the type of stroke from which judge joseph diedhemorrhagic could have been induced by trauma to the head among other things such as rat poison and in fact rat poison would make him

thinking of his own death and eulogy yes if you want to say that i was a drum major say that i was a drum major for justicei was a drum major for righteousness and all of the other shallow things will not matter i wont have any money to leave behind i wont have the fine and luxurious things of life to leave behind but i just want to leave a committed life behindyes jesus i want to be on your

httpmlkkpp01stanfordeduindexphpencyclopediadocumentsentrydocthedrummajorinstinct this seems to sum up what judge joseph wanted as well who will now continue his fight who will fight for him will the haitian parliament can parliament impeach martelly and lamothe the answer is a resounding yes yes yes from the haitian constitution chapter v the high court of justice article 185 the senate may constitute itself as a high court of justice the proceedings of this court are presided over by the president of the senate assisted by the president and vice president of the supreme court as vice president and secretary respectively except where the justices of the supreme court and officers of the public prosecutors office assigned to that court are involved in the accusation in which case the senators one of whom shall be designated by the accused and the senators so appointed shall not be entitled to vote article 186 the house of deputies by a majority of twothirds 23 of its members shall indict a the president of the republic for the crime of high treason or any other crime or offense committed in the discharge of his duties b the prime minister the ministers and the secretaries of state for crimes of high treason and embezzlement or abuse of power or any other crimes or offenses committed in the discharge of their duties d supreme court justices and officer of the public prosecutors office before the court for abuse of authority e the protector of citizens protecteur du citoyen article 1891 the court may not impose any other penalties than dismissal disqualification or deprivation of the right or exercise any public office for no less than five 5 years and no more than fifteen 15 years article 1892 however the convicted person may be brought before ordinary

httpwwwhaitireferencecomhistoireconstitutionsconst1987php we must credit omega news for a heads up on this topic httpomegaworldnewscomp3638 tuesday 13 august 2013 reading haitis constitution the process of impeachment appears pretty much the same as in the us impeachment is an expressed power of the legislature that allows for formal charges against a civil officer of government for crimes committed in office the actual trial on those charges and subsequent removal of an official on conviction on those charges is separate from the act of impeachment itself httpenwikipediaorgwikiimpeachmentintheunitedstates httpenwikipediaorgwikiimpeachment so in other words impeachment is not the actual removal but rather would be an indictment which would allow a trial to take place in the senate only after trial may they be removed from office an official may resign if she does not want to face impeachment and trial eg richard nixon will the chamber of deputies

deputies want to be made obsolete do they want to be stripped of their power and authority they also have their own constituencies there has reportedly been some concern within the chamber of deputies about executive overreach haiti is heir to both old african and old germanic tradition wherein a body of elders essentially a parliament restricted the powers of the executive the concept of european parliament has deeper roots in the germanic folk moots which legislated elected chieftains and kings and judged according to the law which was memorized and recited by the law speaker the judge httpenwikipediaorgwikithingassembly and ancestors of the french were a germanic people the franks old african tradition has been described as very similar to these old nordic traditions old africa knew nothing of the exciting debates in which the founding fathers of the american republic were engaged in the 1770s and which were subsequently to be published as the federalist papers but traditional africa would have appreciated the wisdom of those debates it would have appreciated the advisability of ambition counteracting ambition and it would certainly have appreciated the point that if men and women were angels no government would be necessary a study of traditional government in any part of africa would disclose one fact â a healthy hostility against the concentration of power without accompanying checks and balances to control it beginning with the position of the chief no chief was a chief except by the will of his people in many african societies this maxim was impressed upon the chief in the process of his installation and was in addition to the various mechanisms in place to ensure that the chief marched in step with the wishes of his people it was one way in which traditional african governments founded sovereignty in the people in most cases the council of elders was the chiefs advisory body but it was more than that as representatives of the constituent lineages or clans the council also doubled up as a parliament and no chief could continue to disregard the views of the council without running a real risk of deposition in many cases deposition entailed either suicide or exile depending upon the nature of the misdemeanour chief emeka anyaoku 1998 democracy in africa the challenges and the opportunities httpwwwthecommonwealthorgspeech342933517835200democracyinafricathechallengesandtheopportuhtm we have added bold there is also another reason why the chamber of deputies may decide not to be martellys marionettes â they could along with martellylamothe become like marie antoinette if they latch onto the sinking ship of martellylamothe they too may be sucked under the risk is always there even un occupation may not be able to suppress a hungry population with nothing to lose it is best that martelly and lamothe be removed from office both properly through impeachment and trial and promptly and whisked away to parts unknown like duvalier before them before things get out of control if the powers that be could whisk away a clear dictator like duvalier and a clearly democratically elected president like aristide then surely they can whisk away martelly and lamothe two political liabilities who fall in a sort of grey zone between democratically elected and dictatorship but isnt it better if the chamber of deputies allows itself and haiti to retain some independence and dignity and for the chamber of deputies to impeach martelly and lamothe and let them be put on trial before the senate in this way they will be following in both the african and germanic traditions to which they are heir and a glance at the breadth of history and common sense would suggest that the concept of divine kingship with no checks â ie dictatorship has been rather limited to particular times and places and that elected leaders with some parliamentlike restraints would be the historical rule we ask the haitian chamber of deputies today in the words of dr martin luther king how long will justice be crucified and truth bear it dr king said however difficult the moment however frustrating the hour it will not be long because truth crushed to earth will rise again how long not long because no lie can live forever how long not long because you shall reap what you sow how long not long

because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice those were the words dr martin luther king jr thundered on the steps of the state capitol in montgomery ala on march 25 1965 after the march from selma one day short of the 47th anniversary of that historic moment at 11 pm on march 24 2012 an unarmed black man kendrec mcdade 20 died in a hail of bullets fired by two white pasadena police officers — one on foot the other in a squad car — near the intersection where the history of pasadenas wealth and its poverty meet orange grove boulevard and fair oaks avenue together with the all too similar killing of treyvon martin a month earlier by a neighborhood watch volunteer americas unresolved racial attitudes are back in the forefront with the added contemporary element that the man who shot the florida teenager was half latino and the man who lied to police about mcdade being armed was an undocumented latino immigrant these things dont just happen they grow out of who we were and who we have become for so long pasadena like much of america has been a tale of two cities — one white one black and now with a third of the population latino a tale of three cities pasadena for all its affluence and hipness the beauty of its neighborhoods the resurrection of old pasadena the high quality of life enjoyed by so many has never fully faced the ugly truth about how nearly a fifth of its population lives in poverty how an astonishing third of the schoolage children are in private schools because of the failure of its public schools how the disparity in wealth and circumstance is like a cancer eating away at the life of the city thats true of much of america but the death of kendrec mcdade is pasadenas problem an opportunity once and for all to start a public dialogue that can heal the wounds of the past and build a future where these things dont happen anymore for pasadena this is a story that goes back virtually to its founding as a paradise for the wealthy escaping those awful winters back in the east and midwest they built mansions along orange grove boulevard monuments to the fortunes created by americas entrepreneurial spirit and materialism wrigleys chewing gum bissells vacuum cleaners buschs budweiser beer gambles procter gamble consumer products and so many others they socialized at the valley hunt club founder of the tournament of roses which remains as exclusive as it once was if not quite as exclusionary their cooks cleaners gardeners and servants were mostly blacks who lived a mile or two to the east toward fair oaks avenue in the area where the friendship baptist church still stands as a house of worship for a largely african american congregation over the decades a lot of changes occurred many of the mansions were turned into luxury apartments and smaller homes blacks were pushed into what has become northwest pasadena and ghettoized by the construction of the foothill 210 freeway on the west and south white flight from the public schools started as early as the 1960s and then accelerated by courtordered forced busing 50 years ago evolved into middleclass flight latinos began to move in and gentrification today threatens longtime residents living in structurallysound affordable craftsman homes in need of repairs in a lot of ways it is a microcosm of what has taken place in the san fernando valley and so many other places where dramatic demographic changes occurred without government or civic institutions coming to terms with realities of the residents and then there is a tragedy like this where everything that could go wrong did go wrong — a botched theft a victim lying to the cops about being robbed by armed men cops hunting down the suspects without their red lights flashing or activating the onboard video camera and then firing at least eight times at kendrec mcdade as he reached toward his waistband — apparently without hesitating for even a split second to see whether he had a gun mcdades family already has sued outside investigators have been called in the cops are on administrative leave the community questions the tactics training and even whether one or both of the cops were examined carefully for posttraumaticstressdisorder because of serving in the military in iraq so many questions so much emotion so much on the line — who knows if we will ever know the truth the whole truth of what happened in the darkness in the dead of night just before midnight on march 24 will the cops face charges will the apparent crime victim — oscar carillo 26 — be deported solely because he became involved in the criminal justice system will procedural reforms be put into place as they were in the past after terrible mistakes like this will the bitterness and discontent grow

rising sea levels extremes of weather and an increase in the frequency of droughts and floods will all play havoc with the worlds energy systems as climate change takes hold a new report has found many large plants are particularly at risk from droughts because they need water to cool their facilities and floods because they lack protection from sudden storms electricity distribution networks

as a kid i used to ask my parents why they couldnt just build more lanes on the freeway maybe transform them all into doubledecker highways with cars zooming on the upper and lower levels except as it turns out that wouldnt work because if theres anything that traffic engineers have discovered in the last few decades its that you cant build your way out of congestion its the roads themselves that cause traffic the concept is called induced demand which is economistspeak for when increasing the supply of something like roads makes people want that thing even more though some traffic engineers made note of this phenomenon at least as early as the 1960s it is only in recent years that social scientists have collected enough data to show how this happens pretty much every time we build new roads these findings imply that the ways we traditionally go about trying to mitigate jams are essentially fruitless and that wed all be spending a lot less time in traffic if we could just be a

journal says global warming pause may last for 20 more years and arctic sea ice has already started to recover the daily mail says such reassuring claims about climate abound in the popular media but they are misleading at best global warming continues unabated and it remains an urgent problem the misunderstanding stems from data showing that during the past decade there was a slowing in the rate at which the earths average surface temperature had been increasing the event is commonly referred to as the pause but that is a misnomer temperatures still rose just not as fast as during the prior decade the important question is what does the shortterm slowdown portend for how the world may warm in the future the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc is charged with answering such questions in response to the data the ipcc in its september 2013 report lowered one aspect of its prediction for future warming its forecasts released every five to seven years drive climate policy worldwide so even the small change raised debate over how fast the planet is warming and how much time we have to stop it the ipcc has not yet weighed in on the impacts of the warming or how to mitigate it which it will do in reports that were due this march and april yet i have done some calculations that i think can answer those questions now if the world keeps burning fossil fuels at the current rate it will cross a threshold into environmental ruin by 2036 the faux pause could buy the planet a few extra years beyond that date to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the

civilization will be difficult and dangerous but it is now clear that we will ultimately prevail the only question is how quickly we can accelerate and complete the transition to a lowcarbon civilization there will be many times in the decades ahead when we will have to take care to guard against despair lest it become another form of denial paralyzing action it is true that we have waited too long to avoid some serious damage to the planetary ecosystem – some of it unfortunately irreversible yet the truly catastrophic damages that have the potential for ending civilization as we know it can still – almost certainly – be avoided moreover the pace of the changes already set in motion can still be moderated significantly global warmings terrifying new math there is surprising – even shocking – good news our ability to convert sunshine into usable energy has become much cheaper far more rapidly than anyone had predicted the cost of electricity from photovoltaic or pv solar cells is now equal to or less than the cost of electricity from other sources powering electric grids in at least 79 countries by 2020 – as the scale of deployments grows and the costs continue to decline – more than 80 percent of the worlds people will live in regions where solar will be competitive with electricity from other sources no matter what the large carbon polluters and their ideological allies say or do in markets there is a huge difference between more expensive than and cheaper than not unlike the difference between 32 degrees and 33 degrees fahrenheit its not just a difference of a degree its the difference between a market thats frozen up and one thats liquid as a result all over the world the executives of companies selling electricity generated from the burning of carbonbased fuels primarily from coal are openly discussing their growing fears of a utility death spiral germany europes industrial powerhouse where renewable subsidies have been especially high now generates 37 percent of its daily electricity from wind and solar and analysts predict that number will rise to 50 percent by 2020 indeed one day this year renewables created 74 percent of the nations electricity scorched earth how climate change is spreading drought throughout the globe whats more germanys two largest coalburning utilities have lost 56 percent of their value over the past four years and the losses have continued into the first half of 2014 and its not just germany last year the top 20 utilities throughout europe reported losing half of their value since 2008 according to the swiss bank ubs nine out of 10 european coal and gas plants are now losing money in the united states where up to 49 percent of the new generating capacity came from renewables in 2012 166 coalfired electricitygenerating plants have either closed or have announced they are closing in the past four and a half years an additional 183 proposed new coal plants have been canceled since 2005 to be sure some of these closings have been due to the substitution of gas for coal but the transition under way in both the american and global energy markets is far more significant than one fossil fuel replacing another we are witnessing the beginning of a massive shift to a new energydistribution model – from the central station utilitygrid model that goes back to the 1880s to a widely distributed model with rooftop solar cells onsite and grid battery storage and microgrids the principal trade group representing us electric utilities the edison electric institute has identified distributed generation as the largest nearterm threat to the utility model last may barclays downgraded the entirety of the us electric sector warning that a confluence of declining cost trends in distributed solar­photovoltaicpower generation and residential­scale power storage is likely to disrupt the status quo and make utility investments less attractive this year citigroup reported that the widespread belief that natural gas – the supply of which has ballooned in the us with the fracking of shale gas – will continue to be the chosen alternative to coal is mistaken because it too will fall victim to the continuing decline in the cost of solar and wind electricity significantly the cost of battery storage long considered a barrier to the new electricity system has also been declining steadily – even before the introduction of disruptive new battery technologies that are now in advanced development along with the impressive gains of cleanenergy programs in the past decade there have been similar improvements in our ability to do more with less since 1980 the us has reduced total energy intensity by 49 percent it is worth remembering this key fact about the supply of the basic fuel enough raw energy reaches the earth from the sun in one hour to equal all of the energy used by the entire world in a full year in poorer countries where most of the worlds people live and most of the growth in energy use is occurring photovoltaic electricity is not so much displacing carbonbased energy as leapfrogging it altogether in his first days in office the government of the newly elected prime minister of india narendra modi who has authored an ebook on global warming announced a stunning plan to rely principally upon photovoltaic energy in providing electricity to 400 million indians who currently do not have it one of modis supporters sl rao the former utility regulator of india added that the industry he once oversaw has reached a stage where either we change the whole system quickly or it will collapse nor is india an outlier neighboring bangladesh is installing nearly two new rooftop pv systems every minute — making it the most rapidly

            "body": "on the attribution of flood peaks climate etc by judith curry the hypothesized link between a warming climate and increased frequency and magnitude of floods goes something like this a warmer climate is associated with more water vapor in the atmosphere which means more rainfall and more floods is there any observational support for this link a series of papers on this subject have been published by gabriele villarini at princeton university two of the papers related to the us are highlighted here flood peak distributions for the eastern united states gabriele villarini and james smith abstract annual maximum peak discharge time series from 572 stations with a record of at least 75 years in the eastern united states are used to examine flood peak distributions from a regional perspective the central issues of this study are 1 mixtures of flood peak distributions 2 upper tail properties of flood peaks 3 scaling properties of flood peaks 4 spatial heterogeneities of flood peak distributions and 5 temporal nonstationarities of annual flood peaks landfalling tropical cyclones are an important element of flood peak distributions throughout the eastern united states but their relative importance in the mixture of annual flood peaks varies widely and abruptly in space over the region winterspring extratropical systems and warm season thunderstorm systems also introduce distinct flood peak populations with spatially varying control of flood frequency distributions over the eastern united states we examine abrupt changes in the mean and variance of flood peak distributions through change point analyses and temporal trends in the flood peak records through nonparametric tests abrupt changes rather than slowly varying trends are typically responsible for nonstationarities in annual flood peak records in the eastern united states and detected change points are often linked to regulation of river basins trend analyses for the 572 eastern united states gaging stations provide little evidence at this point 2009 for increasing flood peak distributions associated with humaninduced climate change estimates of the location scale and shape parameters of the generalized extreme value gev distribution provide a framework for examining scaling properties of flood peaks and upper tail properties of flood distributions it is shown that anomalously large values of the gev shape parameter estimates are linked to the role of tropical cyclones in controlling the upper tail of flood distributions scaling analyses of flood peaks highlight the heterogeneities in flood magnitudes over the region with maxima in scaled flood magnitudes in the highelevation appalachian mountains and minima in the lowgradient coastal plain 2010

significant linear trends for those stations with trends there was a split between increasing and decreasing trends no spatial structure was found for stations exhibiting trends there is little indication that human‐induced climate change has resulted in increasing flood magnitudes for the eastern united states examining flood frequency distributions in the midwest us gabriele villarini james smith mary lynn baeck wiltoid krajewski abstract annual maximum peak discharge time series from 196 stream gage stations with a record of at least 75 years from the midwest united states is examined to study flood peak distributions from a regional point of view the focus of this study is to evaluate 1 mixtures of flood peak distributions 2 upper tail and scaling properties of the flood peak distributions and 3 presence of temporal nonstationarities in the flood peak records warm season convective systems are responsible for some of the largest floods in the area in particular in nebraska kansas and iowa spring events associated with snowmelt and rainonsnow are common in the northern part of the study domain nonparametric tests are used to investigate the presence of abrupt and slowly varying changes changepoints rather than monotonic trends are responsible for most violations of the stationarity assumption the abrupt changes in flood peaks can be associated with anthropogenic changes such as changes in land useland cover agricultural practice and construction of dams the trend analyses do not suggest an increase in the flood peak distribution due to anthropogenic climate change examination of the upper tail and scaling properties of the flood peak distributions are examined by means of the location scale and shape parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution paper no jawra100046p of the journal of the american water resources association jawra link to abstract paper not available online co2science provides the following summary of the paper what was learned the four us researchers report that in the vast majority of cases where streamflow changes were observed they were associated with changepoints both in mean and variance rather than monotonic trends and they indicate that these nonstationarities are often associated with anthropogenic effects but rather than increases in anthropogenic co 2 emissions they cite such things as changes in land useland cover changes in agricultural practice and construction of dams and reservoirs what it means based on their findings and as they note in agreement with previous studies they conclude that there is little indication that anthropogenic climate change has significantly affected the flood frequency distribution for the midwest us and as they make doubly clear in the abstract of their paper they say that trend analyses do not suggest an increase in the flood peak distribution due to anthropogenic climate change on the stationarity of flood peaks in the continental us and central europe while the journal articles disappointingly are not available online i spotted an extensive pdf presentation by villarini link some text excerpts problem statement and objectives there is a large spatial variability in flood hazards over the continental united states and central europe profound anthropogenic changes eg changes in land use land cover construction of

period have to be sought spatial heterogeneity in mixtures of flood peaks tropical cyclones control extreme flooding in much of the eastern us analyses of tropical storm frequency in a warmer climate do not suggest a significant increase in tropical storms in the north atlantic basin over the 21st century trenberth on the impact of global warming on flooding from the yale360 forum discussed previously on this thread kevin trenberth senior scientist at the us national center for atmospheric researchs climate analysis section yes undoubtedly the environment in which all storms form has changed owing to human activities global warming has increased temperatures and directly related to that is an increase in the waterholding of the atmosphere over the ocean where there are no water limitations observations confirm that the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere has increased by about 4 percent consistent with a 1 degree f warming of sea surface temperatures since about the 1970s the human component does not change much from year to year and affects all storms however the most spectacular events over the past year have been extreme heavy rains flooding in india china and pakistan in july and august and then queensland australia in december 2010 and january 2011 further very heavy rains in the us in april 2011 along with snow melt have also led to extensive flooding in all these cases very high sea surface temperatures have undoubtedly contributed to extra moisture flowing into the storms that produced the heavy rains and likely contributed to the strength of the storms through added energy while perhaps a major part of these high sea surface temperatures was related to natural variability such as enso el nino southern oscillation a component is related to global warming it is when global warming and natural variability come together that records are broken jc comments villarinis analysis and interpretation seems pretty compelling to me i like the methodology so what is wrong with the picture that kevin trenberth and others have been painting besides the fact that they dont seem to have looked at actual flood data an increase in atmospheric water vapor associated with warmer temperatures doesnt necessarily increase rainfall nor is it necessary that an increase in rainfall is distributed spatiotemporally to produce increased floods it seems that whatever signal that might be found for an increase in floods from global warming is swamped by changes in land use and river engineering moderation note this is a technical thread with comments moderated for relevance like this like loading related",

            "body": "strategies of diversification newfoundland and labrador heritage strategies of diversification the labour force of newfoundland and labrador is now more highly diversified than is usually realized there are more people working in manufacturing excluding fish processing and the pulpandpaper industry than in fish harvesting and more in food and beverage services than in fish processing this diversification has been the product of a century and a half of effort through a range of development strategies and policies and although none proved as successful as their proponents hoped they all contributed to longterm industrialization and diversification of the provincial economy it is useful to distinguish six main approaches 1 opening up the interior for the first three centuries after the arrival of europeans the interior of newfoundland and labrador remained unexplored road building began in earnest in the 1830s and in 1838 the first geological survey was started prowse 1895 454 later in the century as the fishing and sealing industries went through difficult times government and business began to plan for the exploitation of landbased resources they believed that the construction of a railway across the island would be the best way to gain access to timber and minerals lacking sufficient capital of its own the government turned to outside investment and outside promoters to provide the capital and entrepreneurial drive this was to become a recurrent pattern the government entered into a longterm contract with the reid newfoundland company for the operation of the railway which was completed in 1898 on terms highly favourable to the company perlin 1967 438 reid newfoundland company pamphlet reproduced by permission of mont lingard from the collection of mike shufelt next stop gaff topsail grand fallswindsor newfoundland mont lingard publishing mont lingard and mike shufelt ©1996 63 80 kb while the indebtedness it incurred was to plague the government for years and contribute to its demise the initiative nevertheless did contribute to economic diversification mines operated and gave rise to the establishment of resource towns such as bell island st lawrence buchans and baie verte these mines have since closed causing considerable social disruption in the communities affected but for long periods they provided prosperity and employment to hundreds of newfoundland families and a welcome new sector to the islands economy successful pulp and paper mills were established at grand falls and corner brook and these operations and the towns continue to flourish today even though employment in the mills and the woods operations has been much reduced by mechanization while opening up the interior has been plagued by many problems government indebtedness outside ownership and control and the social problems of resource towns that have lost their resource base the strategy nevertheless proved successful in diversifying a singleresource to a threeresource economy 2 smallscale manufacturing the comparative disadvantages of a small local market distance from major metropolitan markets and high transportation costs have limited the development of manufacturing in newfoundland and labrador nevertheless our manufacturing industry has contributed to economic diversification in the past and promises to do so even more in the future there are three phases in the history of manufacturing the first in which mainly local companies produced for the home market grew to prominence in the early years of the 20th century it was protected from outside competition by the small purchasing power of the local economy and by a customs barrier imposed by the newfoundland government many small firms succeeded through manufacturing such things as rope barrels paint and beer for the local marketplace the advent of confederation in 1949 undermined this local manufacturing sector the elimination of the customs barrier opened up the market to larger more efficient competitors from mainland canada and the infusion of cash from federal coffers provided new purchasing power to make the new provincial marketplace attractive to outside firms many local manufacturers closed their operations or sold out to mainland competitors all the local breweries for example and found a new niche as local agents for mainland producers the few firms that did survive notably standard manufacturing which produces matchless paint did so by becoming more competitive and selling products into the mainland marketplace the second phase was part of the new provincial governments efforts at economic development after confederation as part of his develop or perish policy premier joseph smallwood used up much of the fiscal surplus he had inherited from commission of government in a rash attempt to lure outside entrepreneurs to set up manufacturing enterprises in the province newfoundland was intended to become a diversified manufacturing centre producing such things as rubber boots leather shoes and chocolate bars unfortunately most of these enterprises were illconceived and contrary to the basic principles of economics the products could not compete in the local marketplace let alone in outside markets most of the ventures failed much money was squandered and newfoundland businesses became wary of manufacturing ventures for many years some of the ventures however have survived under new ownership and management and some are flourishing enterprises notably terra nova shoes in harbour grace which sells high quality work and fashion boots to mainland and overseas markets the third and most promising phase of smallscale manufacturing in newfoundland is composed mainly of new firms or restructured older firms that are using new production communications and transportation technologies to compete in the global marketplace newfoundland firms can be competitive in batch production for selective market niches in sectors such as electronics computer software specialized clothing and highvalue food products rather than in assemblyline production for mass markets 3 industrializationurbanization in the first postconfederation government conventional economic wisdom vied with political expediency in the formation of policy resulting in an inconsistent approach to development on the one hand through various subsidization schemes and by convincing ottawa to introduce unemployment insurance for selfemployed fishermen smallwood maintained his popularity in rural newfoundland and these policies encouraged people to stay in the outports on the other hand he and his advisers were imbued with the dominant economic thinking of the time which was that industrialization and urbanization were the route to modernization and prosperity following the early failure of his smallscale manufacturing efforts smallwood turned to largescale industrialization as the path to economic development the accompanying social policy was community centralization a resettlement programme through which thousands of people were encouraged to move from hundreds of coastal communities to larger centres these were meant to be growth centres in which a concentration of population would stimulate new economic activity in most cases however it simply meant fewer and larger outports still dependent on the same scarce resource base nevertheless the community centralization program did mean that more people could enjoy modern services and infrastructure at a cost the government could afford smallwoods main economic legacy is largescale manufacturing and resourcebased industrial projects the resourcebased projects were in labrador which was portrayed as a great storehouse of resources to be exploited for the benefit of newfoundlanders a matter of much concern to aboriginal and other labradorians the main projects were the massive hydroelectric project at churchill falls and two large iron ore mines in western labrador which gave rise to two new towns near the québec border wabush and labrador city these projects created thousands of personhours of employment in their construction phases and many families from the island moved to western labrador to take advantage of the new opportunities many found permanent employment in the operations phases of the projects and became residents of labrador this economic activity combined with generous federal government funding for the building of modern infrastructure roads schools hospitals electrification water and sewer systems gave rise to boom conditions and apparent prosperity during the 1960s rapid modernization also gave rise to an unintended diversification of the economy the service sector grew rapidly and became the main generator of new employment beneath the surface however all was not well as the construction boom ended thousands were left jobless and dependent on unemployment insurance construction rather than the fisheries became the occupation of last resort in newfoundland in time it also became clear that outside interests rather than local citizens were reaping many of the benefits of the new megaprojects lacking the public sector funds and suspicious of the local business class that had opposed his campaign for confederation smallwood turned exclusively to outside promoters and investors to bankroll and manage the new megaprojects most of the spinoff benefits and profitmaking accrued elsewhere and the infamous churchill falls hydro contract through which the province of québec reaps most of the financial benefits from the project became an embarrassment to the smallwood government large scale manufacturing projects included a phosphorous reduction plant at long harbour a linerboard mill at stephenville and an oil refinery at come by chance all of which encountered serious problems and consumed a great deal of public money in spite of difficulties all of these megaprojects have contributed to the longterm diversification of the provincial economy come by chance initially failed but was bought by new owners and continues to operate the labrador linerboard mill failed but was taken over and refurbished by abitibi to become the provinces third paper mill the iron ore mines and the hydroelectric project in western labrador continue to employ people and contribute significantly to the gross domestic product of the province 4 resourceled growth the passionate conviction that resourcebased industries could and should be contributing more to the economy and should become the foundation for further diversification became the rallying call of the progressive conservative governments under frank moores and brian peckford for the 17year period 1972 to 1989 if newfoundland could gain control of its rich natural resources and manage them in the best interests of the people of the province then jobs and prosperity could be ensured despite their best efforts as for example in taking public ownership of the churchill falls development corporation moores and peckford found this new approach very difficult to implement the government was too constrained by dependency on outside capital contractual obligations and the jurisdictional limitations of a small provincial administration they did achieve some success however in a new resource industry oil and gas which was not so constrained by past practices their main achievement was the atlantic accord signed in 1985 house 1985 303312 which ensures that many of the employment and spinoff benefits from offshore oil and gas development will accrue to the province with the giant hibernia field already in production and other fields pending a significant new sector has been added to the provincial economy not only the oil and gas industry itself but the spinoff benefits to engineering electronics information technology and other local firms bode well for the further diversification of the provincial economy most of the new activity will be centred in the st johns region and a few other centres such as marystown with its shipbuilding and rigservicing capability fisheriesdependent rural communities will be mainly unaffected 5 rural development the most pressing problem for the future is what to do about rural newfoundland and labrador what will happen to the outports while the main determinant will be the future of the fisheries another important factor will be the success or failure of efforts to develop alternative economic activities in rural regions even the most optimistic forecast for the future of the fisheries is that the sector will employ far fewer people than in the past what else will there be for people to do during the past 35 years there have been several efforts at diversifying the rural economy the commission of government in the 1930s instituted a settlement program under which previously unemployed people could earn a living from the land this scheme was marginally successful only 171 families lived in the land settlements by 1938 while newfoundlands relief population was nearly 90000 neary 1988 65 more promising and more successful was the emergence of a grassroots rural development movement during the 1960s largely in reaction against the governmentimposed resettlement program with the change of government in 1972 this movement was given state encouragement and financial support regional development associations were formed in most regions of the province and while they focussed mainly on fisheriesrelated projects they also gave rise to many smallscale industries such as crafts tourism aquaculture agriculture and secondary food processing the rural development movement became largely deflected from its original purpose during the 1970s and 1980s through the emergence of government job creation or makework projects most of these projects were shortterm geared more towards qualifying people for unemployment insurance than to the longterm diversification of the local economy development associations unwittingly became coopted by government as the local agents of these makework schemes government of newfoundland and labrador 1986 365371 in response to this the 1986 royal commission on employment and unemployment advocated a new approach to rural development the provincial government under premier clyde wells in cooperation with the federal government attempted to pursue such an approach during the 1990s and this has been continued under premier brian tobin the new regional economic development is organized on the basis of 20 regional economic development boards in 20 economic development zones covering the whole province government of canadagovernment of newfoundland and labrador 1995 the aim is to pursue a more professional and businesslike approach to rural economic development aimed at establishing viable enterprises that will operate independently of government support in the long term at the time of writing the boards have been established and most have submitted fiveyear development plans for their zones only time will tell how successful they will be 6 new economy opportunities recent technological changes particularly in telecommunications have changed the terms of international trade making it more feasible for newfoundlandbased firms to be competitive and opened up many new economic opportunities in sectors other than resource sectors the economic recovery commission 1989 1996 identified several sectors in which there are new opportunities and worked with private sector partners and educational institutions to develop strategies for growth the sectors include innovative technologies information industries manufacturing health services and products aquaculture adventure tourism and secondary food processing the emphasis is on making the sectors competitive in both the domestic and export markets economic recovery commission 1992 although operating from a small initial base some of these sectors have shown remarkable growth rates and augur well for the further diversification of the provincial economy © 1998 doug house",

            "body": "exxonmobil uses malaria as an excuse to pursue high risk fossil fuels a new public relations strategy has been taking shape as the fossil fuel industry attempts to push back against criticism for its role in climate change and other forms of environmental degradation that strategy can be seen in the 2012 exxonmobil corporate citizenship report combined with remarks that exxonmobil ceo rex tillerson made during the annual shareholders meeting last week the new argument is that fossil fuels are the most effective pathway for improving the quality of life for emerging economies around the globe or as tillerson is reported to have said at the meeting what good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers as for why a new strategy is necessary consider that the conventional argument of jobs vs the environment has been used with great success to sway public opinion in the us in favor of controversial domestic energy projects for a long time now but that argument is beginning to lose its edge as the renewable energy sector emerges as a rival jobcreating powerhouse with fewer public health drawbacks the 2012 exxonmobil corporate citizen report you can find the 2012 corporate citizen report on exxonmobils corporate community page along with an introductory letter from tillerson a short highlights version is also available lets note first off that a corporate citizen report is not the same thing as a sustainability report on the order of a common reporting standard such as the global reporting initiative gri however exxonmobil does claim that the report cross references gri g31 guidelines along with industryspecific reporting standards developed by the international petroleum industry environmental conservation association and the american petroleum institute oil and gas industry guidance on sustainability reporting visual cues being essential lets also note that the reports signature image is a field of yellow flowers seemingly coexisting in peace with a large natural gas drilling rig parked in the background if you are familiar with exxonmobils 2011 report the 2012 report strikes a similar note in that it does cover problem areas inherent in the oil and gas industry at least insofar as exxonmobil has made progress in addressing them based on a 2002 benchmark that includes a significant reduction in land and water spills the report also lists exxonmobils various charitable efforts highlighted by an antimalaria campaign that has totaled about 106 million since 2002 encompassing 17 countries in asia and africa what good is saving the planet given the context of the antimalaria campaign tillersons nownotorious what good is saving the planet comment is basically shorthand for an argument that he presents expansively in his introductory letter for the 2012 report here is the money quote in the coming decades society will continue to face complex challenges related to a growing world population economic growth climate change food security and public healthwe must recognize that none of the challenges we face can be addressed without reliable and affordable access to energy energy powers our offices and schools it runs lifesaving medical equipment and operating rooms it manufactures vaccines and transports medical personnel in other words fossil fuels are the necessary platform for delivering lifesaving health services to communities that would otherwise go without yes but which fossil fuels as for which fossil fuel exxonmobil has in mind the companys identity is historically entwined with petroleum but as the 2012 reports signature image suggests it has begun to aggressively promote itself as a natural gas company as far as general public awareness is concerned thats an effective strategy given the reputation that natural gas has as a cleanerburning fuel than petroleum and especially coal though public awareness of the impacts of natural gas fracking is beginning to grow natural gas is generally perceived as an environmentally safe fossil fuel exxonmobil has been encouraging that point of view with for example the recent release of a study purporting to show that natural gas obtained through fracking a drilling method that involves pumping chemical brine underground has significantly less lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than coal the 2012 report also identifies building community trust around the development of unconventional natural gas meaning gas obtained through fracking as a key goal for the company however other studies suggest that fracked natural gas has little or no advantage over coal in terms of greenhouse gas management while local impacts of fracking include air pollution and water contamination as well as a documented link between earthquakes and the disposal of fracking wastewater in injection wells shareholders have also become increasingly suspicious for example the organization as you sow and other partners have mounted their fourth annual shareholder campaign to force oil and gas companies toward more disclosure of the risks and impacts of fracking they have met with some success but have run into a brick wall with exxon as reported by reuters last week about 30 percent of exxon shareholders backed the fracking disclosure campaign thats a respectable figure but far short of a convincing one and it demonstrates that public awareness about fracking has a long way to go the other fossil fuel elephant in the room exxonmobils growing image as a clean natural gas company also helps to deflect attention from its petroleum operations which have been expanding into controversial tar sands projects such as the companys recently announced startup of the kearl oil sands project in alberta the distraction is clearly needed in light of the concerns raised by the proposed keystone xl tar sands oil pipeline which were exacerbated this spring with exxonmobils pegasus pipeline spill in arkansas which sent diluted tar sands oil into the suburban community of mayflower and the adjacent lake conway last month prompting the evacuation of residents as of this week mayflower residents are reporting significant health problems and have filed a lawsuit against exxonmobil that brings us full circle to tillersons humanity suffers argument in favor of continued fossil fuel exploitation particularly regarding the antimalaria campaign since the companys own fossil fuel activities could significantly undercut its own antimalaria efforts as described in a recent malaria and climate change study although increased drought in some areas may lead to dry conditions inhibiting malaria in general a warming climate and increased precipitation could favor malaria and introduce it into new regions in other words new corporate

            "body": "think progress embraces creationism atheists hardest hit cns news bearing false witness to pope francis recent lesson on the seven gifts of the holy spirit think progress has twisted his words to fit their upside down thinking in doing so think progress has actually endorsed creationism the longheld traditional biblical view that god created man and earth and all of nature giddy with supposed selfrighteousness jack jenkins of think progress posted pope francis makes biblical case for addressing climate change if we destroy creation creation will destroy us with as much dishonest parsing of the popes words as satan used against jesus about scripture in the desert jenkins called the words of the pope environmentalist theology which is accurate however if you read the entire text of the popes address you find he is talking to destroyers of gods creation all of gods creation with an emphasis on the culture of death that is the hallmark of progressive sacramental rights jenkins writes pope francis made the religious case for tackling climate change on wednesday calling on his fellow christians to become custodians of creation and issuing a dire warning about the potentially catastrophic effects of global climate change speaking to a massive crowd in rome the first argentinian pope delivered a short address in which he argued that respect for the beauty of nature and the grandeur of the cosmos is a christian value noting that failure to care for the planet risks apocalyptic consequences safeguard creation he said because if we destroy creation creation will destroy us never forget this abortion destroys creation in the womb and its acceptance culturally is much of the cause of our nations spiritual demise abortion is destroying us but think progress an oxymoronic website for a death culture movement endorses that destruction pope francis made no mention of global climate change in his wednesday audience but simply expressed the beauty and goodness of gods creation and how our connection to every creature compels us to protect life the pope spoke of the holy spirit who with god the father and son make up the holy trinity and specifically references the creation of life between man and woman his words pope francis and when god finished creating man he didnt say that it was good he said that it is very good he draws us close to him and in gods eyes we are the greatest the most beautiful the best things about creationbut father the angels no the angels are beneath us we are more than the angels we heard it in the book of the psalms god really loves us we have to thank him for this the gift of knowledge places us in profound harmony with the creator and allows us to participate in the brightness of his gaze and his judgment and it is in this perspective that we can grasp in man and woman the summit of creation as the fulfillment of a plan of love that is imprinted in each of us and that makes us recognize each other as brothers and sisters when the leftists tell us that we are destroying nature yet they do not see humans as the best part of nature their agenda and lies begin to show we use natures gifts to better the lives of man the plastics used in neonatal care are made from natures petroleum and the smart phone that connects you to the world uses tin gold and copper yet try to destroy copper gold or water for that matter conservation is a proper and good practice but to suggest that government can change the climate is the biggest lie imaginable and think progress actually abuses the pope to deliver it reading the short address called to mind a hymn of the wondrous power of god and terrific beauty of his creation how great thou art o lord my god when i in awesome wonder consider all the worlds thy hands have made i see the stars i hear the rolling thunder thy power throughout the universe displayed refrain then sings my soul my savior god to thee how great thou art how great thou art then sings my soul my savior god to thee how great thou art how great thou art when through the woods and forest glades i wander and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees when i look down from lofty mountain grandeur and hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze the pope talks about how we as children of god are to be good custodians of creation think progress jumped and grabbed at nature outside of human beings when it is clear that francis is speaking not just of plant life but specifically of human life pope francis at the same time however the gift of knowledge helps us to avoid falling prey to excessive or incorrect attitudes the first lies in the risk of considering ourselves masters of creation to be a master of creation one has to believe they are controlling what god made and only god can do that so really what think progress has done is show once again that they put themselves as god and think they can control his earth the popes final words of the address are this should give us pause for thought and we should ask the holy spirit for the gift of knowledge that creation is a gift from god a gift for the best thing he created which is the human person this rewriting of nearly everything our pope has to say by progressives is constant and to react to him based on reading only the headlines and their version of what the pope said and meant is irresponsible think progress took a terrific message delivered by the pope and accepted by those in good faith and turned it into a partisan lie in order to hide its own desire to defy god and his creation and become sinful masters of nature its really quite a sickening thing the left is doing to make the american people believe that the pope endorses their atheistic ideology",

            "body": "wikileaks drought and syria nytimescom wikileaks drought and syria in the 1970s i got both my bachelors and masters degrees in modern middle east studies and i can assure you that at no time did environmental or climate issues appear anywhere in the syllabi of my courses today you cant understand the arab awakenings â or their solutions â without considering climate environment and population stresses ive been reporting on the connection between the syrian drought and the uprising there for a showtime documentary that will air in april but recently our researchers came across a wikileaks cable that brilliantly foreshadowed how environmental stresses would fuel the uprising sent on nov 8 2008 from the us embassy in damascus to the state department the cable details how in light of what was a devastating syrian drought â it lasted from 200610 â syrias un food and agriculture representative abdullah bin yehia was seeking drought assistance from the un and wanted the us to contribute here are some key lines â the un office for coordination of humanitarian affairs launched an appeal on september 29 requesting roughly 2023 million to assist an estimated one million people impacted by what the un describes as the countrys worst drought in four decades â yehia proposes to use money from the appeal to provide seed and technical assistance to 15000 smallholding farmers in northeast syria in an effort to preserve the social and economic fabric of this rural agricultural community if unfao efforts fail yehia predicts mass migration from the northeast which could act as a multiplier on social and economic pressures already at play and undermine stability â yehia does not believe that the government of bashar alassad will allow any syrian citizen to starve however yehia told us that the syrian minister of agriculture stated publicly that economic and social fallout from the drought was beyond our capacity as a country to deal with what the un is trying to combat through this appeal yehia says is the potential for social destruction that would accompany erosion of the agricultural industry in rural syria this social destruction would lead to political instability â without direct assistance yehia predicts that most of these 15000 smallholding farmers would be forced to depart al hasakah province to seek work in larger cities in western syria approximately 100000 dependents â women children and the elderly or infirm â would be left behind to live in poverty he said children would be likely to be pulled from school he warned in order to seek a source of income for families left behind in addition the migration of 15000 unskilled laborers would add to the social and economic pressures presently at play in major syrian cities a system already burdened by a large iraqi refugee population may not be able to absorb another influx of displaced persons yehia explained particularly at this time of rising costs growing dissatisfaction of the middle class and a perceived weakening of the social fabric and security structures that syrians have come to expect and â in some cases â rely on yehia was prophetic by 2010 roughly one million syrian farmers herders and their families were forced off the land into already overpopulated and underserved cities these climate refugees were crowded together with one million iraqi war refugees the assad regime failed to effectively help any of them so when the arab awakenings erupted in tunisia and egypt syrian democrats followed suit and quickly found many willing recruits from all those dislocated by the drought but also consider this last may 9 the times of israel quoted israeli geographer arnon soffer as observing that in the past 60 years the population in the middle east has twice doubled there is no example of this anywhere else on earth and this last march the international journal of climatology published a study changes in extreme temperature and precipitation in the arab region that found consistent warming trends since the middle of the 20th century across the region manifested in increasing frequencies of warm nights fewer cool days and cool nights and then consider this syrias government couldnt respond to a prolonged drought when there was a syrian government so imagine what could happen if syria is faced by another drought after much of its infrastructure has been ravaged by civil war and finally consider this in the future who will help a country like syria when it gets devastated by its next drought if we are in a world where everyone is dealing with something like a superstorm sandy which alone cost the us 60 billion to clean up asks joe romm founder of climateprogressorg so to iran and saudi arabia who are funding the proxy war in syria between sunnis and shiitesalawites all i can say is that youre fighting for control of a potential humanecological disaster zone you need to be working together to rebuild syrias resiliency and its commons not destroying it i know that in saying this i am shouting into a dust storm but there is nothing else worth saying a version of this oped appears in print on january 22 2014 on page a21 of the new york edition with the headline wikileaks drought and syria order reprints todays paper subscribe",

photograph epa the era of procrastination of halfmeasures of soothing and baffling expedients of delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences winston churchill spoke these words in the house of commons in november 1936 in the aftermath of germanys reoccupation of the rhineland all britain had to do at the time was commit to provide diplomatic support for a french counterattack to prompt a german retreat britain did not make the commitment the consequences are now a matter of world history we have entered our own period of consequences a dithering government a political set more interested in the accumulation and retention of wealth and power than the lives and welfare of their people a nation with a violent past caught up in a waiting game for progress that is not coming millions of desperate and disillusioned people with no way out of their lives of despair a dangerous nexus a toxic mix waiting to combust rage and turmoil have been boiling over in communities across the country for years unheeded as the battle for political power continues to hog centre stage most fatefully it is the shocking failure of leadership at all layers of society that has roused a sense of desperation and with it rebellion marikana became the first major consequence it was the consequence of lesser humans realising that they have nobody but themselves to rely on to escape their hopeless lives and subhuman working and living conditions and so they revolted in an extraordinary wildcat strike that held a major multinational mining company hostage threatening profits and privilege the workers went to war with their union with their company lonmin and with their way of life they did so in some awful ways they killed people they threatened the safety of others and they bit the hand that fed them the scraps they survived on for that 34 of the workers paid the ultimate price they were slaughtered in cold blood by the protectors of our society seventyeight others were injured and 270 workers were held in custody for the deaths of their fellow workers also by the upholders of law and order many of them were tortured and harassed by the police in a bizarre attempt at explaining or justifying the slaughter it has been proffered that these were thugs armed with lethal weapons intent on killing others and the action against them therefore needed to be commensurate – concomitant in cyril ramaphosas parlance an eye for an eye became 34 miners lives for that of two policemen such is the imbalance of the value of human life in a country which holds up the pretence that we all have the same right to life some feel the workers should not be mourned that they deserved to die like they lived in indignity some like national police commissioner riah phiyega go as far as laughing others feel that only some among the dead are victims – the policemen the security guards the national union of mineworkers leader daluvuyo bongo or the anc councillor paulina masuhlo but all 47 people who died at marikana lost their lives due to a multiple failure of the institutions around them – the unions lonmin the police the government the anc and civil society they became players in a web of iniquity where human life was counterposed against the price of a precious metal platinum proved to be the more valuable commodity perhaps the commission of inquiry into the massacre will provide some of the answers as to what prompted the collision of circumstances that led to the now unforgettable images of mineworkers falling into the dust in a fusillade from a wall of heavily armed policemen but it can never undo the horror and brutality that has ripped the fabric of our society or heal the open wounds of the tormented community of marikana they remain there living on the scene of the crime haunted and anguished daily by the injustice of the events that played out we might not be educated but we understand politics and in politics people do not die as they did in marikana these are the words of bhele tholakele dlunga a survivor of the massacre and police torture and a face of the tragedy of marikana bhele like many other people living in marikana is horrendously scarred but understands that what happened to him and friends and coworkers is not normal it really isnt and yet south africa is willing to leave them behind to mourn to be witnesses to the brutality visited on them and to go back to their subhuman lives we are now at the furthest point from where nelson mandela left his nation when he went into retirement we have turned on each other and we fail to feel each others pain and we are willing to leave our fellow citizens face down in the dust of the prized platinum belt their blood spilt in vain it is the ultimate betrayal of the legacy of our founding father who taught us how love reconcile and forgive we are desperately trying to hold on to him willing him to stay with us and yet we are nothing of what he wanted us to be in 2012 our school children who did not get textbooks and who received a substandard education were failed the country became enraptured by a circus around a painting of president jacob zuma with his genitals exposed the anc and alliance leaders took to the streets to have it banned yet the same set of people were subdued during the agony of marikana the eyes of the world turned to us as the mining and farming industries erupted causing our economy to convulse we faced international ratings downgrades and harsh scrutiny from the international media the anc reached its centenary and went to war with itself in a highstakes power battle but marikana was the seminal event of 2012 and postdemocracy south africa it is the end of the innocence and the start of a period of consequences we will never be the same the 47 victims of marikana will forever be a reminder of this in memoriam tembelakhe mati hendrick tsietsi monene sello ronnie lepaaku

murdoch also asked al gore in a tweet to explain the record arctic ice this year since arctic sea ice is still well below average murdoch must have meant antarctic sea ice antarctic land ice continues to melt but it is true that sea ice has increased but because of changing wind patterns and ocean circulation not because the planet is cooling this question is completely explainable posed to someone who isnt a climate scientist but people like murdoch dont necessarily value climate scientists opinions above others rex tillerson reutersjessica rinaldi this year rex tillerson chair and ceo of exxonmobil asked what good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers to a meeting of shareholders in dallas regarding the topic of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions however preventing a lot of suffering caused by the climate changeinduced heat waves extreme flooding sealevel rise food insecurity catastrophic storm events and the like would also be good for humanity last year tillerson called climate change an engineering problem with an engineering solution this sounds like the kind of solution exxonmobils climate change denying shareholders and political mouthpieces can support without suffering much for the rest of humanity the koch brothers charles g and david h koch are the billionaire inheritors of a coal oil and chemical conglomerate that is kept lucrative by fossil fuels the brothers have spent more than 67 million funding groups that deny climate science along with funding clean energy attack group the american legislative exchange council see below the koch brothers are putting their fossilfueled force and dollars behind fighting a wind tax credit that helps finance clean energy projects ignoring of course that the fossil fuel industry has benefited from federal tax breaks for just about the last 100 years the koch brothers have also been pushing a no climate tax pledge on politicians since 2008 through their front group americans for prosperity while unabashedly devised to promote their own self interests over those of the public or the environment the koch brothers wield so much money and power that over 400 politicians had signed the pledge as of july house committee on science space and technology shutterstock seventeen out of 22 republican members of the committee or 77 percent are climate deniers as a point of comparison 97 percent of scientists agree global warming is happening and is humanmade this inverse relationship can have unusual outcomes such as members of the committee preferring to talk about the possibility of life in other planets rather than the imminent danger our own planet is facing a recent committee hearing ended up covering topics such as whether the planet has experienced ice ages will the epa be regulating cow farts and whether epa administrator gina mccarthy signed up for obamacare members of the committee are happy to steer clear of more challenging and serious topics that might upset the fossil fuel industry which has donated 3418079 in career contributions to the republican members of the committee american legislative exchange council the american legislative exchange council alec is a highly influential rightwing lobbying group composed of republican politicians and big businesses undoing statelevel clean energy standards was a major agenda item on alecs 2013 todo list fortunately alec utterly failed at these efforts losing all 13 of its anticlean energy legislative fights at the state level this year rather than admit defeat and give in to common sense alec appears to be doubling down on anticlean energy efforts in 2014 one way the group plans to do this is target net metering policies which allow solar owners to get credit for the energy they feed back into the grid which angers large utility companies and their increasingly antiquated business model in 2014 alec will also be pushing legislation that opposes president obamas nationwide climate action plan especially when it comes to cutting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants joseph bast president and cofounder of the heartland institute the heartland institute is known for things like hosting a climate denier conference and comparing climate science believers and reporters to mass murderers and madmen such as the unabomber earlier this fall after the intergovernmental panel on climate change released its major study on climate science spoiler global warming is unequivocal and its our fault bast said the ipcc — and all the mainstream media and environmental extremists who cite it uncritically — really have become a joke in the scientific community considering 97 percent of scientists believe the planet is warming and humans are causing it one would think the scientific community would think similarly of bast the us chamber of commerce the us chamber of commerce is the nations most powerful business lobbying group recently the group has been formally lobbying against the obama administrations use of a social cost of carbon in legislation according to the epa the social cost of carbon is an estimate of monetary damages from changes in agricultural productivity human health rising sea levels and flood risks and other effects of climate change thomas donohue head of the us chamber of commerce recently told a meeting of business executives that attempts to put regulations on hydraulic fracturing are undermining freedom and hurting the economy bjorn lomborg ted conference bjorn lomborg is not your typical climate grinch lomborg a danish political scientist directs the copenhagen consensus center which compares global problems in an effort to determine how to best allocate available resources however some of lombergs arguments relating to climate change are way off base like criticizing green energy subsidies or promoting continued reliance on fossil fuels as the best way to lift people out of poverty recently lomborg wrote an editorial in the uk times that asserts that global warming has mostly been a net benefit so far and will be for decades so while lomborg does not deny that climate change is happening he might be considered a confusionist as climate progress joe romm recently labeled him with lomborg holding such a high perch from which to espouse his confusing — and even confounding — views the potential negative impact he could have on combating climate change stands to be tall",

            "body": "vatican pope if we destroy the gift of creation creation will destroy us asia news vatican city asianews the call to prayer for chinese catholics on the day in which we honor the our lady of sheshan and the announcement of the beatification of mario vergara pime priest and isidore ngei ko lat catechist and lay faithful killed in 1950 in burma in hatred of the christian faith marked the general audience today in which pope francis continuing to illustrate the gifts of the holy spirit spoke of knowledge in this context pope francis pointed out the sin of not protecting the gift of creation if he added we destroy the gift of creation creation will destroy us after touring among the 70 thousand people present in st peters square the pope pointed out that the knowledge that comes from the holy spirit however is not limited to human knowledge it is a special gift which allows us to grasp through creation the greatness and love of god and his profound relationship with every creature when our eyes are enlightened by the spirit they open to the contemplation of god in the beauty of nature and the grandeur of the cosmos and lead us to discover how everything speaks to us of him and everything speaks to us of his love all this arouses astonishment and a deep sense of gratitude in us it is the feeling we experience when we admire a work of art or any marvel that is the result of the genius and creativity of man before all of this the spirit leads us to praise the lord from the depths of our hearts and recognize in all that we have and are a priceless gift from god and a sign of his infinite love for us the first chapter of genesis at the very beginning of the bible shows us that god delights of his creation by repeatedly emphasizing the beauty and goodness of all things at the end of each day it is written god saw that it was good 112182125 but if god sees that creation is something good and beautiful we too must have this attitude we must see that creation is something good and beautiful the gift of knowledge of this beauty we have to thank god for having given us this gift this beauty this is the pathand when god finished creating man he didnt say that it was good he said that it is very good he draws us close to him and in gods eyes we are the greatest the most beautiful the best things about creationbut father the angels no the angels are beneath us we are more than the angels we heard it in the book of the psalms god really loves us we have to thank him for this the gift of knowledge places us in profound harmony with the creator and allows us to participate in the brightness of his gaze and his judgment and it is in this perspective that we can grasp in man and woman the summit of creation as the fulfillment of a plan of love that is imprinted in each of us and that makes us recognize each other as brothers and sisters all of this is a source of serenity and peace and renders the christian a joyful witness of the god in the wake of st francis of assisi and many saints who were able to sing and praise his love through the contemplation of creation at the same time however the gift of knowledge helps us to avoid falling prey to excessive or incorrect attitudes the first lies in the risk of considering ourselves masters of creation creation is not a property which we can rule over at will or even less is the property of only a few creation is a gift it is a wonderful gift that god has given us so that we care for it and we use it for the benefit of all always with great respect and gratitude the second incorrect attitude is the temptation to limit ourselves to creatures as if they can provide the answer to all our expectations with the gift of knowledge the holy spirit helps us not to give in to all of thisbut i would like to return to the first wrong pathcustodians creation not masters of creation it is a gift that the lord has given us to us we are custodians of creation but when we exploit creation we destroy the sign of gods love for us in destroying creation we are saying to god i dont like it this is not good so what do you like i like myself here this is sin do you see custody of creation is custody of gods gift to us and it is also a way of saying thank you to god i am the master of creation but to carry it forward i will never destroy your gift and this should be our attitude towards creation safeguard creation because if we destroy creation creation will destroy us never forget this once i was in the countryside and i heard a saying from a simple person who loved flowers and he nurtured these flowers and he said we must nurture these beautiful things that god has given us creation is for us to use well not exploit to nurturebecause do you know father god always forgives yes it is true god always forgiveswe men women we forgive sometimes yes sometimes we forgive not always but father creation never forgives and if you dont custody creation it will never forigive you this should give us pause for thought and ask the holy spirit for the gift of knowledge that creation is a gift from god a gift for the best thing he created which is the human person to those present the pope recalled that on may 24 we celebrate the liturgical memorial of the blessed virgin mary help of christians who is venerated with great devotion at the shrine of sheshan in shanghai i ask all the faithful to pray that under the protection of the mother help of christians catholics in china continue to believe to hope to love and to be in all circumstances a leaven of harmonious coexistence among their fellow citizens also saturday next he added in aversa italy pime priest mario vergara and the lay catechist isidore ngei ko lat killed in 1950 in burma in hatred of the christian faith will be beatified may their heroic fidelity to christ be an encouragement and example to missionaries and especially catechists in mission lands who carry out important and irreplaceable apostolic work for which the whole church is grateful finally before concluding the meeting pope francis again asked for prayers and support for the people of bosnia and herzegovina and serbia and recalled that next saturday he will depart for the holy land first of all to celebrate with ecumenical patriarch bartholomew the historical embrace between paul vi and athenagoras 50 years ago peter and andrew will meet again and this is beautiful and then for peace in the land that suffers so much",

            "body": "2014 blog series rejecting rejection saying yes to yourself when the world says no writing barn welcome to the first of a new blog series rejecting rejection saying yes to yourself when the world says no join us every other monday as writers at various career points share how they deal with the inevitable as a writer and creative rejection today we welcome writing barn owner and author bethany hegedus to kick off the series and share how the blog series came to be after the final no by bethany hegedus lying in bed the morning of new years eve i let the 10 years it has taken for my next book grandfather gandhi to come to be to wash over me i sat again with the numerous rejections the moves from one agent to another the endless revisions the years i let it sit knowing i hadnt found the right words yet i recalled the editor letters that found the subject fascinating but wanted arun gandhi and me to turn it into a chapter book one meant for older kids a chapter book wasnt our vision a picture book was one with powerful images that would be meant for all ages i remembered the countless times i emailed arun reporting not yet and were close only to have the book rejected again how could this be taking this long would i ever get it right now that the book is soon to release i am not at all ashamed of the many twists and turns it took to publication i am proud that the book born out of my 911 experience as a fire searcher at one world financial and arun gandhis time spent with his grandfather as a boy took as long as it did to see the shelves and its a good thing because the recent pw starred review opens with this line more than 10 years in the writing this true story by gandhis grandson and hegedus truth with a capital t gives a personal window inside the peacemakers teachings there it was for the world to read more than 10 years in the writing for 10 years i lived these lines from brene browns wonderful book daring greatly how the courage to be vulnerable transforms the way we live love parent and lead vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage truth and courage arent always comfortable but theyre never weakness i had to keep reassuring myself that i wasnt weak that i wouldnt crumble under the weight of my publishing hopes i went on to publish two novels but the gandhi project still hadnt found a home one weary winter black friday in publishing reared its ugly head this was the beginning of the end–jobs were being cut bottom lines were being halved this as it just so happens was the same week that the gandhi book was going to auction on monday there were five or so offers on friday there were none but there was an interested editor namrata tripathi whom had just moved from disneyhyperion to ssantheneum she wanted a revision we met in person at the ss offices as i was leaving new york for austin she had on amazing highheeled blue suede shoes and i knocked a container of pens off her desk i was so nervous but i left confident she was the right editor for the book though no official offer was on the table arun gandhi his holiness the dali lama and and martin luther king iii the behindthescenes route to publication continued i wrote and revised for a year still no offer and somewhere there was some famous illustrator who wanted to write and illustrate a gandhi book i have no clue who that famous illustrator was and there was this internal race to see whose project would get contracted by ss i was tasked with one final revision both the editor and my then agent the wonderful regina brooks had thrown up their editorial hands after my last revision where i executed exactly what was asked for but the text had fallen flat i had failed myself i had failed arun we all wanted the text to be stellar it needed to be universal and yet specific it needed to capture gandhi as a world leader but also as a human being as a man who cared about his grandson and a grandson who was having trouble living up to the peacemakers name this revision was my last chance i could feel the years of work my desire to put something good into the world after my 911 experience pressing on my shoulders i couldnt do it i was going to blow it should i even try with those thoughts running through my head the universe gifted me an austin snow day which meant there was no snow only the threat of snow but that didnt matter what mattered was i didnt have to go to work i could give this difficult manuscript one last try gandhijis sandals picture taken at aga khan palace in pune india on my recent trip there it was cold outside and i turned my small apartments heater to 90 degrees trying to turn my beige carpet into the dusty roads of india i spread out all my notes my years of interviews with arun drafts and drafts of words that had thus far amounted to nothing but nos looking at it all i was angry and ashamed i let those feelings be i didnt try to push them aside this time arun whose story we were telling was angry and ashamed when he showed up outside gandhis hut when he was 12 i had experienced anger and shame all my life we all have it didnt feel good id rather pretend my anger and shame didnt exist but i couldnt not anymore too much was on the line so i stayed with my personal shame and feelings of failure and fear and i stayed with aruns anger and injustice at the beatings he received as a boy growing up in south africa and his desire to strike back i felt him reach for a rock on the soccer field a story that did happen and i felt him run to his grandfather looking for solace and what he got was an understanding of anger and a reaction to injustice that changed him and can change us all the draft that very day became the book that will soon hit the shelves after the contract the illustrator search was on and its our good fortune it took as long as it did as debut talent evan turk whose collage watercolors guache and cut paper and fabrics turned the gandhi book into a thing of mesmerizing beauty and feeling when arun and i first began working on the book in early 20o2 turk was still 14 no wonder the universe had us wait as writers we are truth tellers and as writers the simple truth is we will never escape rejection theo pauline nester in writing is my drink says it better than i ever could there is no way to become a published writer without becoming a rejected writer there is no way to succeed—whatever your vision of success might be—without going through the dark tunnel of failure though how long that tunnel will be for you i dont know reading both brown and nester and thinking about my own roller coaster ride with grandfather gandhis release something congealed for me what if we shown a light on the darkness of writer rejection and failure leading to success what if we as writers talked to each other about how we had the courage to keep sending our work out into a world that constantly and pretty darn consistently tells us no and sometimes when it is being polite says no thank you what if we shared our publishing survival stories like a cancer survivor who is not ashamed of the scars and wounds could we give hope to other writers who may be on the verge of giving up could we touch the part of ourselves that was scared and vulnerable and still kept on could we share that could we laugh and rejoice knowing another dark tunnel of rejection on the current project looms ahead at the writing barn were all about process and craft its where we writers live and as one of my writing mentors tim wynne jones said time worrying about the biz is useless worry about the story but living in the process and pursuing our craft we sometimes need emotional life preservers thats what i imagine our 2014 blog series rejecting rejection saying yes to yourself when the world says no to be—a lifeline for twentysix mondays throughout 2014 stop by the writing barn blog and read the rejecting rejection essays from writers at all stages of their careers read about option books being cancelled what to do when the yeses turn to nos read snippets of real rejection letters that writers writing for the series are brave enough to share these essays will be both personal and truthful explorations into how what and who holds the power of no is it the publishing industry a powerful agent or is it ourselves friends gather at a writing barn event and view the galleys of grandfather gandhi taped over my writing desk for the 10 years i wrote at a reception desk in financial firms all over manhattan was a line from a wallace stevens poem that became my beattherejectionblues mantra after the final no there comes a yesand on that yes the future world depends this line from the well dressed man with the beard reminded me that there would be a final no that eventually if i kept going kept learning kept writing kept trying i would get a yesand i did you will too photo credit sam

            "body": "climate change 2 degrees centigrade global warming its a point of no return in west antarctica what happens next last week saw a holy shit moment in climate change science a landmark report revealed that the collapse of a large part of antarctica is now unstoppable ross island antarctica – taken by a nasa icemonitoring team photograph michael studingerepa last monday we hosted a nasa conference on the state of the west antarctic ice sheet which it could be said provoked something of a reaction this is what a holy shit moment for global warming looks like ran a headline in mother jones magazine we announced that we had collected enough observations to conclude that the retreat of ice in the amundsen sea sector of west antarctica was unstoppable with major consequences – it will mean that sea levels will rise one metre worldwide whats more its disappearance will likely trigger the collapse of the rest of the west antarctic ice sheet which comes with a sea level rise of between three and five metres such an event will displace millions of people worldwide two centuries – if that is what it takes – may seem like a long time but there is no red button to stop this process reversing the climate system to what it was in the 1970s seems unlikely we can barely get a grip on emissions that have tripled since the kyoto protocol which was designed to hit reduction targets slowing down climate warming remains a good idea however – the antarctic system will at least take longer to get to this point the amundsen sea sector is almost as big as france six glaciers drain it the two largest ones are pine island glacier 30km wide and thwaites glacier 100km wide they stretch over 500km many impressive scientists have gone before us in this territory the concept of west antarctic instability goes back to the 1970s following surveys by charles bentley in the 1960s that revealed an ice sheet resting on a bed grounded well below sea level and deepening inland hans weertman had shown in 1974 that a marinebased ice sheet resting on a retrograde bed was unstable robert thomas extended his work to pursue the instability hypothesis terry hughes suggested that the pine island sector of west antarctica was its weak underbelly and that its retreat would collapse the west antarctic ice sheet considerable uncertainty remained about the timescale however due to a lack of observation of this very remote area things changed with the launch of the ers1 satellite which allowed glaciers in this part of antartica to be observed from space in 1997 i found that the grounding line where the glacier detaches from its bed and becomes afloat of pine island glacier had retreated five kilometres in the space of four years between 1992 and 1996 stan jacobs and adrian jenkins had found a year earlier that the glacier was bathing in unusually warm waters which suggested the ocean had a major influence on the glacier duncan wingham and others showed that the glacier was thinning in 2001 i found that thwaites glacier was retreating too at that point the scientific community took a different look at the region work by the british antarctic survey nasa and chile led to more detailed observations a monitoring programme was initiated instruments were placed on the ice in the ocean and scientific results started to pile up from a variety of research programmes from that point we all sought to find out whether this was really happening now two decades after this process started we have witnessed glacier grounding lines retreat by kilometres every year glaciers thinning by metres every year hundreds of kilometres inland losing billions of tons of water annually and speeding up several percent every year to the flanks of topographic divides thwaites glacier started to accelerate after 2006 and in 2011 we detected a huge retreat of the glacier grounding lines since 2000 detailed reconstructions of the glacier bed further confirmed that no mountain or hill in the back of these glaciers could act as a barrier and hold them up and 40 years of glacier flow evolution showed that the speedup was a long story all these results indicate a progressive collapse of this area at the current rate a large fraction of the basin will be gone in 200 years but recent modelling studies indicate that the retreat rate will increase in the future how did this happen a clue is that all the glaciers reacted at the same time which suggested a common force that can only be the ocean ocean heat is pushed by the westerly winds and the westerlies have changed around antarctica in response to climate warming and the depletion of the ozone the stronger winds are caused by a world warming faster than a cooling antarctica stronger westerlies push more subsurface warm waters poleward to melt the glaciers and push surface waters northward nerilie abram and others have just confirmed that the westerlies are stronger now than at any other time in the past 1000 years and their strengthening has been particularly prominent since the 1970s as a result of humaninduced climate warming model predictions also show that the trend will continue in a warming climate what this means is that we may be ultimately responsible for triggering the fast retreat of west antarctica this part of the continent was likely to retreat anyway but we probably pushed it there faster it remains difficult to put a timescale on it because the computer models are not good enough yet but it could be within a couple of centuries as i noted there is also a bigger picture than west antarctica the amundsen sea sector is not the only vulnerable part of the continent east antarctica includes marinebased sectors that hold more ice one of them totten glacier holds the equivalent of seven metres of global sea level controlling climate warming may ultimately make a difference not only about how fast west antarctic ice will melt to sea but also whether other parts of antarctica will take their turn several candidates are lined up and we seem to have figured a way to push them out of equilibrium even before warming of air temperature is strong enough to melt snow and ice at the surface unabated climate warming of several degrees over the next century is likely to speed up the collapse of west antarctica but it could also trigger irreversible retreat of marinebased sectors of east antarctica whether we should do something about it is simply a matter of common sense and the time to act is now antarctica is not waiting for us",

haryana and maharashtra slash consumer bills in a populist wave before elections thats jeopardizing a 31 billion government bailout of the industry which requires companies to boost rates the power sector needs tough politics and the only person in politics today who might be capable of that kind of toughness is modi said sl rao the head of indias central electricity regulator from 1998 to 2001 according to his website the utility industry has reached a stage where either we change the whole system quickly or it will collapse rao who was appointed to the regulatory body by an independent committee said he maintains no political affiliation manifesto awaited modi 63 is the chief minister of gujarat he and his bharatiya janata party havent yet published an election manifesto at the same time hes indicated he wants to reduce indias dependence on coal which generates 68 percent of electricity the fossil fuel is supplied by state monopoly coal india ltd at a 44 percent discount to global prices we have to focus on generating more power from our abundant renewable energy resources modi declared at a rally for 10000 supporters in central madhya pradesh state on feb 26 the time

nationalist bjp will get the most seats as voters punish the ruling congress party for the nations economic slump while modis early backing of solar helped make gujarat home to about 40 percent of

solar capacity to 10000 megawatts by 2017 enough for about 40 million indian homes it wants photovoltaics working as cheaply as coal by 2022 its on track to surpass those goals five years earlier than expected aided by a plunge in solar prices and higher costs for oil gas and coal according to tarun kapoor the joint secretary at the ministry of new and renewable energy modi has been talking of his big ideas during rallies across the country but he has been very very frugal with specifics said satish misra senior fellow at the observer research foundation think tank in new delhi raising doubts about his ability to deliver in an industry where state administrations hold more sway than the central government states role indias power grid is controlled by the states local governments ensure free or belowcost electricity to farmers while buying it from generators using ever increasing debt modi tackled the issue in gujarat by splitting electricity for agriculture from the rest of the market farmers get cheap power for only a few hours a day uninterrupted supply is guaranteed to paying businesses households and industries gujarats distribution utilities are the only ones with an aplus rating from the ministry of power and its one of only two states that didnt suffer a power deficit in the 10 months to february according to central electricity authority data the renewable

university student on the importance of american indian scientists as informed voices for climate change dialogs in their own communities 1 a flurry of recent reports has made it clear that humancaused anthropogenic climate change is upon us and serious efforts to shishmaref alaska address it need to begin now 234567 the most recent report the third us national climate assessment released may 6 2014 repeatedly points out that racial and ethnic minorities are particularly vulnerable and already being impacted 8 this is old news for the inupiaq residents of shishmaref alaska who have seen the homeland where they have lived for centuries sinking into melting permafrost while being hammered by extraordinary storm surges from the chukchi sea as well as for indigenous populations of lowlying pacific island nations such as kiribati whose homelands are literally disappearing beneath the waves as oceans undergo thermal expansion 91011 in the droughtimpacted us–mexican border area the socioeconomically stressed population can ill afford even higher temperatures and greater water shortages 1213 for these communities and others from which sacnistas come anthropogenic climate change is no nebulous future danger but current reality training scientists to make the case though our nation has had a long frustrating public debate on how––or even whether––to address climate change we will soon have to begin making some hard choices 14 when scarce resources are being allocated to mitigate and adapt to climate change we must be sure that the physical biological and social scientific aspects of the particular problems our communities face in a climatechanged world have been well studied so that our needs can be addressed to that end we must have trained scientists from our communities ready to make the case to funding agencies for those studies and then to take part in them it would otherwise be too easy for the focus to be on other peoples problems while ours get overlooked 1516 paving the way our communities already do have scientists working in relevant fields several are highlighted on the sacnas website dr margaret hiza redsteer crow a geoscientist working on water issues for the navajo nation who has melded scientific data with the knowledge of elders to discover the ties between these problems and climate change dr daniel mindiola a chemist at indiana university who seeks creative uses for greenhouse gases that keep them out of the atmosphere and dr timberley roane lumbee a microbial ecologist at the university of colorado–denver 17 for budding bioscientists according to an editorial in nature reviews microbiology we live in a golden age for microbial biology in part because of problems that are being foregrounded by climate change 18 dr roanes current work is in another area of great ecological importance using microbes to remove heavy metals from the environment another example is dr jeanninemarie st jacques métis a paleoclimatologist at the university of regina in saskatchewan who gave a wellreceived talk on megadroughts at a symposium i organized for the 2012 aaas annual meeting in vancouver 19 i learned from her that it was possibly due to a megadrought that my early siouan forebears abandoned an agrarian lifestyle and instead pursued bison the original american fast food a priority for science policy this list is far from exhaustive but we still need more scientists from our communities working on climate change issues to assure that our problems receive full attention when our nation and the world finally face up to the need to address climate change it should be a priority in science policy at the federal state and for american indians tribal levels to increase the number of scientists from our communities who can contribute while i have been framing this need in terms of social justice it extends beyond that if some kennedyesque figure were to ask not just what climate science can do for us but what we can do for climate science we should have some ready answers i believe we do the most obvious one is that in our nations quest to remain at the forefront of science we can not afford to overlook any part of our talent pool the national science foundations 2010 figures for us doctoral scientists and engineers show that only 27500 of the 805500 or about 34 fall into the categories of american indian or alaska native and hispanic or latino 20 according to the 2010 us census we were then about 134 of the population so a large part of the pool is indeed being overlooked 21 diverse thinking not thinking differently this is particularly unfortunate because of the added value we bring to the scientific table beyond mere numbers before going further i must stress that i am making no claim that any of our groups are evolutionarily programmed to think differently than others particularly because there are those who have used such claims to explain away the numbers in the preceding paragraph such claims are nonsense for years i have fought against one that has been around awhile that there is something about american indians that programs us to be bad at mathematics the modern version of this has generally been framed in terms of hemispheric dominance the theory of the rightbrained indian based on the notion that skill in mathematics resides in the brains left hemisphere one might try to argue that this is perhaps just a statement about cultural imperatives that have shaped learning styles however the more ominous side of the theory is illustrated by papers published in reputable neuroscience journals in the 1980s claiming that measurements of anglo and american indian brains have shown genuine brain asymmetries in favor of lefthemispheric dominance in the first group but not the second 22 this and further studies claiming inherent intellectual differences between american indians and others have either been convincingly refuted or not been replicable 23 but too many counselors still point american indians away from mathematicsbased careers in the belief that studies have shown that their advisees are doomed to failure primed to deal with wicked problems however i do believe that many from the communities served by sacnas have been culturally primed by a holistic worldview to be pretty good at dealing with wicked problems of which climate change is a classic example wicked problem is actually a technical term first defined by horst rittel and melvin webber in a 1973 paper describing the basis for certain dilemmas in urban planning 24 though rittel and webbers annotated 10point definition extends over more than eight pages mike hulmes simplification of it captures the concept fairly well and is easier to state wicked problems are essentially unique have no definitive formulation and can be considered symptoms of yet other problems solutions to wicked problems are difficult to recognize because of complex interdependencies in the system affected a solution to one aspect of a wicked problem often reveals or creates other even more complex problems demanding further solutions 25 rittel and webber describe at length why attempts to solve wicked problems via linear reasoning as traditionally taught in university stem courses are not generally successful a holistic view is key i believe that the cultural backgrounds and history of american indians and more broadly of all the communities served by sacnas contribute to our ability to think about and deal with wicked problems that have only incomplete solutions these are best approached holistically with all the information at hand while avoiding preconceptions about how to use that information a good example is dr redsteers approach to dealing with a wicked problem the difficulties the navajo nation faces in finding a highquality and reliable water supply described in her sacnas video a scientists university training would likely suggest that the right tactic would be to collect data analyze it and consult the scientific literature to decide which approaches might work and dr redsteer has certainly done that but if no more than that were done then a scientist could bang her or his head against a wall for years trying to devise an ultimate solution to a problem that may have none 26 dr redsteer went well beyond that by consulting elders and the community to discover the historical and current cultural contexts in which a partial solution would have to work with no perfect one available then stepped back to look holistically at everything she had learned and what it was telling her here is what she says about the result i dont really have a whole lot of solutions right now to the ultimate problem of how to get the navajo more water but i think the first thing is to recognize that something is happening so that people not just on the navajo nation but in the surrounding communities understand how endangered their water supplies are and try to manage their water supplies more wisely 27 from her holistic look at the historical cultural and community aspects as well as the scientific ones dr redsteer has concluded that at this point the real problem is not how to solve the navajo nations water shortage quickly but is finding strategies to live with that shortage the partial solution she describes will do that while she and others continue to work on understanding and addressing the root causes full un derstanding of the threat people in our communities need to understand fully the danger climate change poses to us particularly because many contrarian voices out there are trying to convince us that there is no real need to worry we certainly know and research has substantiated that information to our communities about important issues impacting us is best received by those communities if it comes from knowledgeable people within those communities 28 as marei spaola puts it in the quote that begins this article our people need to hear it from us all hands on deck an interdisciplinary approach my final point is addressed directly to students and to practicing physical biological and social scientists i fully recognize that anthropogenic climate change may not be what gets you up in the morning and keeps you up at night as dr redsteer says in her video you may not wish to spend your lives working on this wicked problem but the field is so interdisciplinary that you can almost certainly make contributions no matter what your scientific interests are psychologists will find problems worth attacking as has organizational psychologist keith james onondaga in his examination of the impact of organizational ethics and practices on climate change 29 judging from student participation in the sacnas conference many of you are heading for a biomedical career and you will find a plethora of challenging problems in those areas into which you can sink your teeth 30 political scientists will be interested in the difficulties bert bolin the first ipcc chair faced in dealing with the response of political systems to challenging global problems and perhaps make contributions themselves in that arena 31 computer scientists both hardware and software specialists will appreciate how their field has contributed to the successes and controversies of climate science and perhaps see where their own contributions could enhance the former and reduce the latter 32 and mathematicians have much to contribute particularly by helping us better understand tipping points and their warning signs 33 ill end with a final quote about climate change from dr redsteers interview its actually worrisome that people are so insulated from the natural world that they believe that the birds and the bees and the butterflies are going to be hurt but not them i think its a very egotistical position for human beings to be in to think that they are so above the natural system that its not going to have any effect on their lives i am confident that people in our communities generally know better we can be part of the solution we must be part of the solution please consider making a contribution this article is based on a keynote presentation by dr megginson at the 2013 sacnas national conference in san antonio view a video of his talk at

from top climate scientists gathering in japan this week to assess the impact of global warming in fact they will say the dangers of a warming earth are immediate and very human the polar bear is us says patricia romero lankao of the federally financed national center for atmospheric research in boulder colo referring to the first species to be listed as threatened by global warming due to melting sea ice she will be among the more than 60 scientists in japan to finish writing a massive and authoritative report on the impacts of global warming with representatives from about 100 governments at this weeks meeting of the intergovernmental panel on climate change theyll wrap up a summary that tells world leaders how bad the problem is the key message from leaked drafts and interviews with the authors and other scientists the big risks and overall effects of global warming are far more immediate and local than scientists once thought its not just about melting ice threatened animals and plants its about the human problems of hunger disease drought flooding refugees and war becoming worse the polar bear is us the report says scientists have already observed many changes from warming such as an increase in heat waves in north america europe africa and asia severe floods such as the one that displaced 90000 people in mozambique in 2008 are now more common in africa and australia europe and north america are getting more intense downpours that can be damaging melting ice in the arctic is not only affecting the polar bear but already changing the culture and livelihoods of indigenous people in northern canada past panel reports have been ignored because global warmings effects seemed too distant in time and location says pennsylvania state university scientist michael mann this report finds its not faroff in the future and its not exotic creatures — its us and now says mann who didnt work on this latest report the united nations established the climate change panel in 1988 and its work is done by three groups one looks at the science behind global warming the group meeting in japan beginning tuesday studies its impacts and a third looks at ways to slow warming dita alangkara ap file oxfam activists wearing polar bear costumes stage a demonstration outside the venue of the un climate change conference in nusa dua bali island indonesia its reports have reiterated what nearly every major scientific organization has said the burning of coal oil and gas is producing an increasing amount of heattrapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide those gases change earths climate bringing warmer temperatures and more extreme weather and the problem is worsening the panel won the nobel peace prize in 2007 months after it issued its last report since then the impact group has been reviewing the latest research and writing 30 chapters on warmings effects and regional impacts those chapters havent been officially released but were posted on a skeptical website war poverty and famine the key message can be summed up in one word that the overall report uses more than 5000 times risk climate change really is a challenge in managing risks says the reports chief author chris field of the carnegie institution of science in california its very clear that we are not prepared for the kind of events were seeing already the effects of global warming are widespread and consequential says one part of the larger report noting that science has compiled more evidence and done much more research since the last report in 2007 if climate change continues the panels larger report predicts these harms violence for the first time the panel is emphasizing the nuanced link between conflict and warming temperatures participating scientists say warming wont cause wars but it will add a destabilizing factor that will make existing threats worse food global food prices will rise between 3 and 84 percent by 2050 because of warmer temperatures and changes in rain patterns hotspots of hunger may emerge in cities water about onethird of the worlds population will see groundwater supplies drop by more than 10 percent by 2080 when compared with 1980 levels for every degree of warming more of the world will have significantly less water available health major increases in health problems are likely with more illnesses and injury from heat waves and fires and more food and waterborne diseases but the report also notes that warmings effects on health is relatively small compared with other problems like poverty wealth many of the poor will get poorer economic growth and poverty reduction will slow down if temperatures rise high enough the worlds overall income may start to go down by as much as 2 percent but thats difficult to forecast according to the report risks from warmingrelated extreme weather now at a moderate level are likely to get worse with just a bit more warming while it doesnt say climate change caused the events the report cites droughts in northern mexico and the southcentral united states and hurricanes such as 2012s sandy as illustrations of how vulnerable people are to weather extremes it does say the deadly european heat wave in 2003 was made more likely because of global warming climate change really is a challenge in managing risks texas tech university climate scientist katharine hayhoe who was not part of this report team says the important nuance is how climate change interacts with other human problems its interacting and exacerbating problems we already have today university of colorado science policy professor roger pielke jr a past critic of the panels impact reports said after reading the draft summary its a lot of important work they made vast improvements to the quality of their assessments another critic university of alabama huntsville professor john christy accepts manmade global warming but thinks its risks are overblown when compared with something like poverty climate change is not among the developing worlds main problems he says but other scientists say christy is misguided earlier this month the worlds largest scientific organization the american association for the advancement of science published a new fact sheet on global warming it said climate change is already happening more heat waves greater sea level rise and other changes with consequences for human health natural ecosystems and agriculture are already occurring in the united states and worldwide these problems are very likely to become worse over the next 10 to 20 years and beyond texas techs hayhoe says scientists in the past may have created the impression that the main reason to care about climate change was its impact on the environment we care about it because its going to affect nearly every aspect of human life on this planet she says — seth borenstein the associated press first published march 24 2014 927 am",

surprising and in parts stirring piece in rolling stone on how we may have turned the corner in fighting runaway climate change gore bases his optimism in large part on the plummeting cost of solar power but he also believes that for all the noise of climate denialists common sense is winning the day its rare to find good news on the climate front and its possible gore is accentuating the positive because the negative makes people despair and do nothing but nonetheless his factfilled piece is well worth reading his daring claim comes in the opening lines in the struggle to solve the climate crisis a powerful largely unnoticed shift is taking place the forward journey for human civilization will be difficult and dangerous but it is now clear that we will ultimately prevail the only question is how quickly we can accelerate and complete the transition to a lowcarbon civilization there will be many times in the decades ahead when we will have to take care to guard against despair lest it become another form of denial paralyzing action it is true that we have waited too long to avoid some serious damage to the planetary ecosystem – some of it unfortunately irreversible yet the truly catastrophic damages that have the potential for ending civilization as we know it can still – almost certainly – be avoided moreover the pace of the changes already set in motion can still be moderated significantly posted by james button at open labors first sydney event we noticed something a bit strange for a labor event young people turned up we were delighted to see young people not only having their say but doing so with passion one of those was william woods here is what will had to say on the night tonight i would like to briefly address the current issues that we as a society are faced with and the importance of the grassroots being active on those issues leading by example demonstrating to the parliamentary wing of the labor party that reform can only be beneficial and lead to growth in our movement there are many issues which seem too big for the individual to fight alone such as homelessness which will be on the rise with the serious threats to public housing and closure of essential services and shelters this is where the party needs to reform lead the fight on such issues and help us as individuals to make the change on issues we are passionate about i believe that those of us here tonight joined labor to make a difference and we need to be given the tools to make those differences which can only be done by reforming the party to allow more grassroots involvement a timeless grassroots politician ben chifley once said the labor movement was not created with the objective of always thinking what is the most acceptable thing to do – whether this individual will win a seat or whether the movement will pander to some section of the community the labor movement was created by pioneers and its objectives have been preached by disciples of the labor movement over the years to make decisions for the best for all people the things we fight for i would like to inspire you become the change you want to see and get on with the

per capita has discovered a marked turnaround in public attitudes to taxation and spending per capitas annual tax survey finds that australians are not so selfish after all between 2010 and late 2012 our views of the tax system became steadily less generous – we felt increasingly that we were paying too much tax and our support for public spending while high was falling these sentiments have now reversed rather than saying they pay too much australians now claim they are paying about the right amount of tax and their support for higher public spending has risen read more about the report here this is the first of a series of articles by tom bentley for the guardian it was originally published here the public reaction to australias 2014 budget has been like a compound fracture to the governments backbone its first signs are a visible discomfort in undertaking routine daily activities like radio interviews and community visits over time the signs of a deeper fragmentation will begin to appear along with extreme constraint in the governments ability to carry any weight or respond with agility to obstacles in its way",

gain a better perspective on how the whole situation evolved mega quotes iii would go further back in time than part i it seems they get better as we go further back into last year that is with all the pr spin we get in 1999 i can only tell you that i do want the full unvarnished truth about y2k risks so that i can exercise the responsibility that i have for my family and my community i may not represent a majority but from the massive amount of email that i receive every day i know that there are several thousands of concerned citizens across the land who share my feelings we learn that some 90 of the large companies in the us are planning y2k control centers for the millennium rollover and that many companies are stockpiling a month of parts and raw materials and we wonder whether we should be doing the same thing we learn from a variety of sources that roughly half of the small businesses small towns and small countries outside the us have not even begun their y2k preparations and we wonder what impact this will have on the global economy and why so many economists continue telling us that it wont have any impact at all we read story after story about the good progress that large companies and major federal agencies are making but then we read that large companies are falling behind schedule and that 22 dont think they will finish even their missioncritical systems some of us work in the computer software industry and we know from our own experience as well as the statistical data from metrics experts such as capers jones and howard rubin that 15 of all software projects are late by an average of 67 months and 25 of all projects are cancelled before completion and we wonder what kind of special information or knowledge allows our nations leaders to realistically expect that things will be substantially different for the thousands of y2k projects underway today those who are determined to be optimists about y2k can pluck from this hodgepodge of information the good news that they want to read and those who are determined to be pessimists can find the bad news that they need to confirm their fears but those who seek a middle road are merely confused they dont know what to believe ed yourdon before the us senate special committee on the year 2000 technology problem united states senate may 25 1999 im increasingly less concerned about whether there will be true systemic problems what i am concerned about are peoples reactions to the fear that something momentous is going to happen on january 1st 2000 im sure that people will get very wise soon and recognize that the last thing you want to do is to draw inordinate amounts of currency out of the banks alan greenspan may 6 1999 as if he would say differently oh and the fedgov will be announcing that people should prepare for y2kinduced losses of services for 14 days heard it at wdc y2k in the back of the room where the known troublemakers hang out cory hamasaki italy is going to crash and we are going to be crucified we are supposed to make things go so smoothly that nobody would realize there was ever a problem instead we will be the scapegoats we have only consultative powers and no one is listening to us romano oneda italys year 2000 committee education expert i received this letter from my bank your atm card has an expiration date of 1999 and will no longer work after 123199 therefore you will be receiving a new atm card in the mail in two weeks ahead the expiration date on your new card will be 1249 december 2049 which will expire first 1 my atm card 2 me 3 the banking system gentlemen place your bets credit cards and money orders are acceptable until 123199 gary north the more important issue behind the euro weakness is the dirty little secret that is being kept from the general media at all costs the euro clearing system still does not work between banks all currency transactions settle at the end of every day euro settlements are also taking days banks in london are putting euro checks on a 4week clearing status the net effect many are starting to discount the euro in order to accept it this is not such a good story for a currency that was going to knock the dollar off this planet most central banks are still unofficially not accepting euros as a reserve currency which has been told to us on a confidential basis if publicly confronted on this issue everyone would naturally deny it but the failure of the euro has been expressed in its near perfect swan dive since january 1st martin a armstrong nicks comment yet the euro is largely a success story unlike y2k in europe where work was deferred to get the euro up and running y2k has evidenced the largest failure to meet a deadline in computer history and it has happened three times in a row remember 12311998 with a year for testing now it is june 30th 1999 with six months for testing soon it will be september 30th with three months for testing and then 12311999 with three minutes for testing and a full year for spin control doug mcintosh despite assurances by most large usbased companies that they will be ready for the century date change very few were actually ready at the end of last year according to the disclosure reports they filed with the securities and exchange commission sec during the fourth quarter of 1998 most large companies expect to be done with their y2k projects sometime during the second half of 1999 the data provided by the largest companies suggest that they were just halfway through their projected y2k budgets at the start of this year even more disturbing is that a march 1999 survey of 1600 large canadian companies found that only 18 expected to be ready at the end of april last may this same survey found that 15 reported that they were ready at that time for y2k is it possible that the proportion of large companies that are prepared for the century date change increased by only three percentage points in the past year in canada if so are the canadian results a good proxy for the situation in the united states i suspect so especially since canadian company managers have been at least as aware and alarmed about y2k as their american counterparts ed yardeni while attending a collectibles show on the east coast over the weekend at dinner i happened to be sitting beside the wife of the head of the entire y2k program for a major new york money center bank upon learning what her husbands position is someone else at our table said im very concerned about y2k in fact i intend to withdraw a considerable amount of my money from the banks this fall to which the lady replied oh ive already done that i said to the lady youre telling us that your husband is in charge of a major banks y2k code remediation project and that you are taking your assets out of the system at this she took alarm and would not discuss it further i think she realized she had let something slip out that should not have cody varian i still think there is a 70 per cent chance of repression which is pretty much the same expectation i had a year ago ed yardeni unlike before i now believe there is about an 85 chance the market will drop at least 45 due to y2k and its a 5050 chance it will take four to five years to recover to new highs the bottom line is the economy is headed for a recession like ive said before but it could last up to twice as long as i originally predicted john f mauldin i was in looking at assault rifles today at one of my local gun stores i got to talking to the owner and y2k came up he told me that more than one of his best longterm customers with affiliations to ciadod groups have told him of a plan for a quick response imposition of martial law 72 hours the date he heard from some of them was december 1st to disburse the troops and have martial law in place in 72 hours by december 4th in other words the idea for the timing presumably being that it will be clear by then just how many nations companies and agencies are not going to be ready and enough time for the soldiers to integrate with the rail and utility distributions perhaps for ration coupon books to be printed and available by january 1st etc he didnt say his sources knew that martial law was going to be implemented but that the sources had seen plans for possible implementation take it as you will tim may im still unhappy about the fact that only two of the regular members of the committee bothered to show up for the hearing i know that lots of things are going on in the senate and may 25th was also the day that the cox report was released but the fact remains that we witnesses who appeared at their invitation at our own expense and having expended a considerable amount of time and energy preparing our statements were speaking to an essentially empty room to me that says a lot about the degree of interest and the sense of urgency or lack thereof that the government feels about all of this i think paloma oriley had the best comment of all when she said that all of the concern that is being expressed about panicking and overreaction is only related to preserving the economy the politicians and government leaders show no such concern about the lives health and safety of the citizens themselves but as the clinton camp would no doubt remind us its the economy stupid ed yourdon the date code at my job for our 1 system is so badly broken that we are throwing out 300 cobol and macro assembly programs on our mainframe we looked at the then 17yearold system in 1996 and because of its extensive use of dates and because the system had extensive annual maintenance worked on by who knows how many programmers that all think differently well we figured it would be impossible to patch the system in time we now have 14 people developing a system from scratch using all state of the art stuff sql visual studio etc heres the best part we will not be done by summer 2000 we will have enough working to get basic annual production out the door but the products will be missing quite a few details that are on the current mainframe system so from my tunnel vision point of view yes the code is broken but what do i know ive only been working and playing with computers for 31 years anonymous systems manager ultimately there is only a limited amount of control that corporations and government agencies have over the technological outcome of y2k yet the prevailing attitude seems to be that government and industry are in control as long as they can manage the perceptions of the public i have believed all along that y2k is too big too complex and too systemic in nature to be controlled from a technological perspective and i believe that the publics perception of y2k will ultimately be shaped by tangible events that impact their lives much more than its shaped by the spin control efforts of government and industry for the past few months the pr spin control has been quite effective and i fully expect that it will continue throughout the summer as government and industry seek to reassure the public and since the public would generally prefer to be reassured that the government is taking care of any problems looming on the horizon rather than face the possibility of serious disruptions the spin control efforts may continue succeeding even into the fall of 1999 ed yourdon i work in an it department at a major bank while i am not directly involved in the y2k effort many of my colleagues are and i have access to a rich variety of remediation and testing data the picture i am seeing is definitely not pretty our testing schedule is extremely tight several weeks ago the occ mandated additional test dates that must be completed by the end of the month the implications of not meeting these new deadlines i do not know i do know however that upper management is in a frenzy resources are being shuffled left and right and tension is palatable i regularly monitor the abend logs and they are plentiful resources system space job dependencies data files and warping coordination etc all seem to be conspiring against us my direct supervisors have confided to me that they are stocking food of course all vacations have been cancelled will we make it i honestly dont know will we say we will definitely we still are rated satisfactory by the occ everyone is that i know of what scares me is that i honestly believe that we are in better shape than our competitors anonymous programmer for many manufacturing companies jit may have a new meaning in a few months january its toast randy y jones a 75billionplus financial services company with headquarters in minneapolis minnesota that serves millions of customers in locations throughout the midwest and west has stated the intention to limit cash withdrawals by customers later this year the bank president who gave me this information is very much against this idea but due to the size and influence of the aforementioned institution he feels other banks may follow suit he thought it would be a public relations nightmare and would make matters worse i believe this policy is an indication of the panic some bankers are starting to feel over the possibility of large cash withdrawals and the accompanying liquidity problems they will bring nabi davidson i believe that we are entering the end game of y2k and that the outcome isnt likely to be changed significantly because of lastminute strategies edicts proclamations or demands for deathmarchstyle overtime on the part of programmers about the only thing thats still an option both for organizations and for individuals is contingency planning and preparations for some degree of disruptions ed yourdon author of timebomb 200005301999 it is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope we are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts for my part whatever anguish of spirit it may cost i am willing to know the whole truth to know the worst and to provide for it patrick henry american patriot 05281999 weve known for some time that small and midsized companies would have difficulties in their preparations for the new millennium but the poor progress made by so many of americas largest companies came as quite a shock dr martin weiss chairman of weiss ratings

behind in addressing them it is at risk of not completing remediation of all of its missioncritical systems in time senate special report on y2k 24 february 1999 03291999 even if the us could remediate all of its systems and embedded processors in time which it can not it would in an economic sense still be at the mercy of the rest of the world senate special report on y2k 24 february 1999 03251999 owing to past neglect in the face of plainest warnings we have now entered upon a period of danger the era of procrastination of half measures of delays is coming to a close in its place we are entering a period of consequences we can not avoid this period we are in it now unless this house resolves to find out the truth for itself it will have committed an act of abdication of duty without parallel winston churchill testimony to the house of commons debate on national defense posture 12 november 193603161999 on the positive side y2k awareness is growing in the past year both

            "body": "2013 may 30 extreme liberals blog i find myself thinking of this quote from inigo montoya in the princess bride a lot lately it is overused i know but it works so well you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means the word ive been hearing a lot lately that fits inigos observation is scandal according to merriam webster the word scandal is defined as 2 loss of or damage to reputation caused by actual or apparent violation of morality or propriety the 1 definition was a religious one weve all heard the republicans and their stenographers the press say the word scandal about a million times in the last couple of months but do any of these issues really qualify as a scandal i say no the benghazi scandal that isnt american embassies and consulates have been attacked many times in our history particularly in dangerous areas bob cesca did an amazing job in compiling the attacks on america during the bush administration here is a portion of that post january 22 2002 calcutta india gunmen associated with harkatuljihad alislami attack the us consulate five people are killed june 14 2002 karachi pakistan suicide bomber connected with alqaida attacks the us consulate killing 12 and injuring 51 october 12 2002 denpasar indonesia us diplomatic offices bombed as part of a string of bali bombings no fatalities february 28 2003 islamabad pakistan several gunmen fire upon the us embassy two people are killed may 12 2003 riyadh saudi arabia armed alqaida terrorists storm the diplomatic compound killing 36 people including nine americans the assailants committed suicide by detonating a truck bomb july 30 2004 tashkent uzbekistan a suicide bomber from the islamic movement of uzbekistan attacks the us embassy killing two people december 6 2004 jeddah saudi arabia alqaida terrorists storm the us consulate and occupy the perimeter wall nine people are killed march 2 2006 karachi pakistan again suicide bomber attacks the us consulate killing four people including us diplomat david foy who was directly targeted by the attackers i wonder if lindsey graham or fox news would even recognize the name david foy this is the third karachi terrorist attack in four years on whats considered american soil september 12 2006 damascus syria four armed gunmen shouting allahu akbar storm the us embassy using grenades automatic weapons a car bomb and a truck bomb four people are killed 13 are wounded january 12 2007 athens greece members of a greek terrorist group called the revolutionary struggle fire a rocketpropelled grenade at the us embassy no fatalities march 18 2008 sanaa yemen members of the alqaidalinked islamic jihad of yemen fire a mortar at the us embassy the shot misses the embassy but hits nearby school killing two july 9 2008 istanbul turkey four armed terrorists attack the us consulate six people are killed september 17 2008 sanaa yemen terrorists dressed as military officials attack the us embassy with an arsenal of weapons including rpgs and detonate two car bombs sixteen people are killed including an american student and her husband they had been married for three weeks when the attack occurred this is the second attack on this embassy in seven months im racking my brain trying to remember a scandal coming from any of these attacks the idea that changing talking points to not tip off the terrorists responsible for the attacks was some sort of massive conspiracy to make the president look good is just ridiculous we shouldnt forget that this scandal started with mitt romney putting his foot in his mouth during the campaign and since then the gop has doubled down on it many times they were so sure that it was the one thing that could take the president out if only someone would listen the real reason that republicans are trying to create a scandal where there is none is because they cant accept that they got their asses kicked again by president obama its one giant case of soreloseritus the next step is for the republicans to ask for a do over or a mulligan on the 2012 elections get over it you lost and a free tip for you republicans americans dont like sore losers you look like fucking weasels and remember the media and the gop are calling this an obama scandal first off there is no scandal there there was no violation of morality or propriety by anybody let alone the president there hasnt been any connections to the president at all with the release of the emails that jon karl of abc news was duped about being generous that show that the white house let the agencies involved fight over the infamous talking points this whole issue should be but a bad memory and my god they were freaking talking points talking points that were prefaced by susan rice in the following way let me tell you the– the best information we have at present first of all theres an fbi investigation which is ongoing and we look to that investigation to give us the definitive word as to what transpired but putting together the best information that we have available to us today our current assessment is what exactly is so hard to understand about this unless you

form amy goodman this week marks the final week of black history month and this year 2013 marks the 50th anniversary of a pivotal year in americas civil rights movement on august 28th 1963 an estimated quarter of a million people joined the march on washington for jobs and freedom where dr martin luther king delivered his famous i have a dream speech well today we spend the hour featuring an historic look at the movement that led up to that march on washington we air major excerpts of the rarely seen 1970 documentary king a filmed recordfrom montgomery to memphis the film was directed by sidney lumet and produced by ely landau largely made from original newsreel footage the film was played at a onetimeonly event march 24th 1970 in theaters across the country the film was nominated for an academy award and is listed in the national film registry but ever since 1970 the documentary has been rarely seen—until now as the distributors of the film have given us permission to share it with you the film has just been released as a two dvd set by kino lorber it begins december 1955 with dr martin luther king jr addressing a full church in montgomery alabama it was just days after rosa parks was arrested the african community—the africanamerican community in montgomery had gathered to decide whether to begin what became the famous montgomery bus boycott rev dr martin luther king jr it has been moved and seconded that the resolution as read will be received and adopted are you ready for the question all in favor let it be known by standing on your feet that was the day that we started a bus protest which literally electrified the nation and that was the day when we decided that we were not going to take segregated buses any longer and you know when we planned the bus boycott we said if we could just get about 50 or 60 percent of the negroes of montgomery not to ride buses this would be an effective boycott i think that whole day we found eight negroes on the buses and from that day on that boycott was more than 999 percent effective i remember that monday morning when i was subpoenaed to be in court the chief defender many things ran through my mind and i started thinking about the people all day long trying to think of something to say to the people finally i arrived to the pulpit my words were fumbling a bit let us fight passionately and unrelentingly for the goals of justice and peace lets be sure that our hands are clean in the struggle let us never fight with falsehood and violence and hate and malice but always fight with love so that when the day comes that the walls of segregation have completely crumbled in montgomery that we will be able to live with people as their brothers and sisters and i say to you my friends rise up and know that as you struggle for justice you do not struggle alone but god struggles with you freedom is never given to anybody for the oppressor has you in domination because he plans to keep you there and he never voluntarily gives it up and that is where the strong resistance comes weve got to keep on keeping on in order to gain freedom it is not done voluntarily but it is done through the pressure that comes about from people who are oppressed privileged classes never give up their privileges without strong resistance klan speaker they want to throw white children and colored children into the melting pot of integration through out of which will come a conglomerated mulatto mongrel class of people amy goodman a member of the ku klux klan klan speaker both races will be destroyed in such a movement i for one under god will die before ill yield one inch for that kind of a movement rev dr martin luther king jr i want young men and young women who are not alive today but who will come into this world with new privileges and new opportunity i want them to know and see that these new privileges and opportunity did not come without somebody suffering and sacrificing for them amy goodman dr kings church and his house was bombed in montgomery alabama rev dr martin luther king jr the executive board of the montgomery improvement association recommends that the 11monthold protest against the city buses will be called off and that the negro citizens of montgomery alabama will return to the buses on a nonsegregated basis it is further recommended that this return to the buses will not take place until the mandate from the united states supreme court is turned over to the federal district court amy goodman that was november of 1955 rev dr martin luther king jr we have the assurance from authentic sources that this mandate will come to montgomery in a matter of just a few days for those three or four days we will continue to walk and share rides cc owens i hereby defy ruling handed down by the united states supreme court ordering desegregation of public carriers alabama state law requiring segregation of races on buses still stands as long as i am president of the

department to continue to make arrests in all violations with reference to the segregation laws and as long as i am police commissioner of the city of montgomery i intend to follow this course rev dr martin luther king jr this morning the longawaited mandate from the united states supreme court concerning bus segregation came to montgomery amy goodman 1955 rev dr martin luther king jr this mandate expresses in terms that are crystal clear that segregation in public transportation is both legally and sociologically invalid in the light of this mandate and the unanimous vote rendered by the montgomery improvement association about a month ago the yearold protest against city buses is officially called off and the negro citizens of montgomery are urged to return to the buses tomorrow morning on a nonsegregated basis amy goodman that was dr martin luther king jr speaking december 20th 1956 announcing the end of the montgomery bus boycott after more than 380 days in a moment well

including several arrests of dr king himself who was moved to write his letter from a birmingham jail in this next segment youll also hear dr king read his letter in the context of the movement then underway it was a response to a statement by eight white alabama clergy titled a call for unity in which they called for the battle against racial segregation to be fought solely in the courts not in the streets we start with james earl jones james earl jones reading langston hughes i looked and i saw that man they call the law he was coming down the street at me i had visions in my head of being laid out cold and dead or else murdered by the third degree i said o lord if you can save me from that man dont let him make a pulp out of me but the lord he was not quick the law raised up his stick and beat the living hell out of me now i do not understand why god dont protect a man from police brutality being poor and black ive no weapon to strike back so who but the lord can protect me well see rev dr martin luther king jr you know when i say dont be afraid you know what i really mean dont even be afraid to die and i submit to you tonight that no man is free if he fears death but the minute you conquer the fear of death at that moment you are free you must say somehow i dont have much money i dont have much education i may not be able to read and write but i have the capacity to die it is an unhappy truth that racism is a way of life for the vast majority of white americans and i can see nothing more urgent than for america to work passionately and unrelentingly to get rid of the disease of racism if i would seek to give you a blueprint for our freedom in birmingham tonight i would say first that at this moment we must decide that we will no longer spend our money in businesses that discriminate against negroes i will not rest until we are able to make this kind of witness in this city so that the power structure downtown will have to say we cant stop this movement and the only way to deal with it is to give these people what we owe them and what their godgiven rights and their constitutional rights demand reading letter from birmingham jail my dear fellow clergymen while confined here in the birmingham city jail i came across your recent statement calling my present activities unwise and untimely since i feel that you are men of genuine goodwill and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth i want to try to answer your statement in what i hope will be patient and reasonable terms you deplore the demonstrations taking place in birmingham but your statement i am sorry to say fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the united states its ugly record of brutality is widely known there have been more unsolved bombings of negro homes and churches in birmingham than in any other city in the nation these are the hard brutal facts of the case you may well ask why direct action why sitins marches and so forth isnt negotiation a better path nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue you speak of our activity in birmingham as extreme was not jesus an extremist for love love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you will we be extremists for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim when you have seen hatefilled policemen curse kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters when you see the vast majority of your twenty million negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your sixyearold daughter why she cant go to the public amusement park and see her developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people when you have to concoct an answer for a fiveyearold son who is asking daddy why do white people treat colored people so mean when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading white and colored when your first name becomes nigger your middle name becomes boy however old you are and your last name becomes john and your wife and mother are never given the respected title mrs when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a negro living constantly at tiptoe stance never quite knowing what to expect next and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments when you are forever fighting a degrading and degenerating sense of nobodiness—then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait you assert that our actions even though peaceful must be condemned because they precipitate violence isnt this like condemning jesus because his unique godconsciousness and neverceasing devotion to gods will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion i have no despair about the future i have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in birmingham even if our motives are at present misunderstood we will reach the goal of freedom in birmingham and all over the nation because the goal of america is freedom we will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of the almighty god are embodied in our echoing demands we have asked for four things and we are still holding out for all four the desegregation of all facilities in the stores this includes restroom facilities lunch counters and fitting rooms number two upgrading in employment in the stores so that you have negro clerks and negro salesmen and women number three the dropping of all of the charges against the persons who have been unjustly arrested for engaging in these peaceful nonviolent demonstrations on the basis of the first and 14th amendments of the constitution number five— unidentified four rev dr martin luther king jr i mean number four the appointment of a biracial committee to deal with the other problems of segregation that still exist and the setting of a timetable to solve the problems such as school desegregation the reopening of the parks on an integrated basis in compliance with the federal court order and a fair hiring policy in municipal agencies and this would also include negro policemen eugene bull connor you can never whip these birds if you dont keep you and them separate youve got to keep the white and the black separate let the law enforcement agencies—thats what youve got them hired for—and the governor of the state of alabama handle this thing now george asked me to ask you to do that do him one favor amy goodman this is bull connor eugene bull connor tell your friends when you leave here between now and tuesday dont go up there leave it alone theyre going to handle this situation just leave it alone you know those kennedys up there in washington that little old bobby socks and his brother the president theyd give anything in the world if we had some trouble here if we dont have any trouble we can beat them at their own game rev dr martin luther king jr the activities which have taken place in birmingham over the last few days to my mind mark the nonviolent movement coming of age this is the first time in the history of our struggle that we have been able literally to fill the jails and in a real sense this is the fulfillment of a dream for ive always felt that if we could fill the jails in our witness for freedom it would be a magnificent expression of the determination of the negro and a marvelous way to lay the whole issue before the conscience of the local and national community and i think in a real sense this birmingham movement is one of the most inspiring developments in the whole nonviolent struggle we must say to our white brothers all over the south who will try to keep us down we will match your capacity to inflict suffering with our capacity to endure suffering we will meet your physical force with soul force we will not hate you and yet we can not in our good conscience obey your evil laws do to us what you will threaten our children and we will still love you come into our homes at the midnight hours of life and take us out on some desolate highway and beat us and leave us there and we will still love you run all around the continent send your literature and say that we arent worthy of integration that we are too immoral that we are too low that we are too degraded and yet we will still love you bomb our homes and go by our churches early in the morning and bomb them if you please and we will still love you but we will wear you down by our capacity to suffer in winning the victory we will not only win our freedom we will so appeal to your heart and your conscience that we will win you in the process amy goodman dr martin luther king announcing the end of the birmingham

advancement of justice and freedom and human dignity i have the pleasure to present to you dr martin luther king jr amy goodman dr martin luther king rev dr martin luther king jr i am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation five score years ago a great american in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the emancipation proclamation this momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity but 100 years later the negro still is not free one hundred years later the life of the negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination one hundred years later the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity one hundred years later the negro is still languished in the corners of american society and finds himself an exile in his own land we have also come to his hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood now is the time to make justice a reality for all of gods children there will be neither rest nor tranquility in america until the negro is granted his citizenship rights we must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline we must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force the marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people for many of our white brothers as evidenced by their presence here today have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow i still have a dream it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal i have a dream that one day on the red hills of georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood i have a dream that one day even the state of mississippi a state sweltering with the heat of injustice sweltering with the heat of oppression will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character i have a dream today i have a dream that one day down in alabama with its vicious racists with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification one day right there in alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers i have a dream today i have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted and every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together this is our hope this is the faith that i go back to the south with with this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope with this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood with this faith we will be able to work together to pray together to struggle together to go to jail together to stand up for freedom together knowing that we will be free one day i say to you today my friends so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of new hampshire let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of new york let freedom ring from the heightening alleghenies of pennsylvania let freedom ring from the snowcapped rockies of colorado let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of california but not only that let freedom ring from stone mountain of georgia let freedom ring from lookout mountain of tennessee let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of mississippi from every mountainside let freedom ring and when this happens when we allow freedom ring when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet from every state and every city we will be able to speed up that day when all of gods children—black men and white men jews and gentiles protestants and catholics—will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old negro spiritual free at last free at last thank god almighty we are free at last amy goodman dr martin luther king jr speaking at the march on washington august 28th 1963 50 years ago this year its part of the film king a filmed recordmontgomery to memphis we end todays show by returning to alabama 1965 where there were three historic marches from selma to the capital montgomery the first took place march 7 1965 and became known as bloody sunday after police attacked 600 marchers with billy clubs and tear gas the second march came the following tuesday attracting more than 2500 protesters who were forced to turn around by police after crossing the edmund pettus bridge we hear from dr king as he successfully crosses the bridge along with thousands of others on the third march under the watch of federal troops mobilized by president johnson finally we will hear dr kings address in the capital of montgomery where the march triumphantly ends rev dr martin luther king jr we have the right to walk the highway we have the right to walk to montgomery if our feet can get us there we must let the nation know and we must let the world know that it is necessary to protest this threefold evil the problem of the denial of the right to vote to police brutality—that we continue to face and faced in its most vicious form last sunday—and then the attempt to block first amendment privileges reporter how do you feel about the protection being given you on this march rev dr martin luther king jr i think this is a real demonstration of the commitment of the federal government to protect the constitutional rights of negro citizens the protection has been a very thorough as you can see and the men are working under the guidance and certainly under the power and influence of the federal government to see that things are carried out in an orderly manner so i think that everybody has to recognize that this symbolizes a new commitment and a new determination on the part of the federal government to take the kind of vigorous line that will assure the rights of the negro citizens of this nation reporter dr king how are things shaping up now for tomorrow rev dr martin luther king jr things are shaping up beautifully we have people coming in from all over the country i suspect that we will have representatives from almost every state in the union and naturally a large number of people from the state of alabama and we hope to see and we plan to see the greatest witness for freedom ever taken place—that has ever taken place on the steps of a capitol of any state in the south and this whole march adds drama to this total thrust last sunday more than 8000 of us started on a mighty walk from selma alabama they told us we wouldnt get here there were those who said that we would get here on their—over their dead bodies but all the world today knows that we are here and we are standing before the forces of power in the state of alabama saying we aint going to let nobody turn us around today i want to tell the city of selma today i want to say to the state of alabama today i want to say to the people of america and the nations of the world that we are not about to turn around we are on the move now yes we are on the move and no wave of racism can stop us the burning of our churches will not deter us the bombing of our homes will not dissuade us the beating and killing of our clergymen and young people will not divert us the wanton release of their known murderers will not discourage us we are on the move now like an idea whose time has come not even the marching of mighty armies can halt us we are moving to the land of freedom i know youre asking today how long will it take somebody is asking how long will prejudice blind the visions of men i come to say to you this afternoon however difficult the moment however frustrating the hour it will not be long because truth crushed to earth will rise again how long not long because no lie can live forever how long not long because you shall reap what you sow how long not long truth forever on the scaffold wrong forever on the throne yet that scaffold sways the future and behind the dim unknown standeth god within the shadow keeping watch above his own how long not long because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice how long not long because mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord he is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored he has loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword his truth is marching on he has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat he is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat o be swift my soul to answer him be jubilant my feet our god is marching on glory hallelujah glory hallelujah glory hallelujah glory hallelujah his truth is marching on

            "body": "the direct line between climate change and the current disaster in syria the brad blog by brad friedman on 992013 605am pt during last tuesdays green news report i snarked to my cohost desi doyen that sec of state john kerrys recent comments at the pacific islands forum about the serious threats posed by global warming have convinced me we must bomb global warming she noted in response correctly that actually theres a lot of analysis out there supporting the idea that climate change causing drought is also part of the impetus behind the unrest in the middle east of course i dismissed the charge out of hand mostly for comedic effect but i really shouldnt have as climatecrockcoms peter sinclair explained in a detailed post last week detailing exactly how drought attributed to climate change which devastated syria and elsewhere in the region from 2006 to 2011 helped spark the initial protests at the beginning of the arab spring in 2010 and 2011 how it helped to exacerbate the current mess in the wartorn syria and how its exactly what the dept of defense and even senator john kerry had long ago tried to warn us all about as mercilessly cribbed from sinclair following the terrible yearslong drought russia banned all grain exports in august of 2010 as reported by washington post egypt one of the biggest importers of wheat began to run out as grain harvests elsewhere were devastated as well production dropped that year by 35 in canada where heavy rain destroyed much of canadas wheat crop and the worst flooding in more than a decade slashed chinas rice production global food prices spiked leading npr to report in january of 2011 that political unrestin tunisia yemen egypt and other arab countries were in response in part to dramatic price hikes for basic foodstuffs the advent of the unrest now referred to as arab spring sinclair explains coincided with rising grain prices and food rioting across the region which is among the largest food import regions in the world last year the economist noted the arab spring was obviously about much more than food but it played a role the foodprice spike was the final nail in the coffin for regimes that were failing to deliver on their side of the social contract says jane harrigan of londons school of oriental and african studies in syria according to a memo from state department policy planning veteran william polk published by the atlantic over the labor day weekend syria has been convulsed by civil war since climate change came to syria with a vengeance polk details how farmers desperately tapped aquifers with tens of thousands of new wellsbut as they did the water table quickly dropped to a level below which their pumps could lift it in some areas all agriculture ceased in others crop failures reached 75 and generally as much as 85 of livestock died of thirst or hunger hundreds of thousands of syrias farmers gave up abandoned their farms and fled to the cities and towns in search of almost nonexistent jobs and severely short food supplies outside observers including un experts estimated that between 2 and 3 million of syrias 10 million rural inhabitants were reduced to extreme poverty the domestic syrian refugees immediately found that they had to compete not only with one another for scarce food water and jobs but also with the already existing foreign refugee population syria already was a refuge for quarter of a million palestinians and about a hundred thousand people who had fled the war and occupation of iraq formerly prosperous farmers were lucky to get jobs as hawkers or street sweepers and in the desperation of the times hostilities erupted among groups that were competing just to survive survival was the key issue the senior un food and agriculture organization fao representative in syria turned to the usaid program for help terming the situation a perfect storm in november 2008 he warned that syria faced social destruction he noted that the syrian minister of agriculture had stated publicly that the economic and social fallout from the drought was beyond our capacity as a country to deal with but his appeal fell on deaf ears the usaid director commented that we question whether limited usg resources should be directed toward this appeal at this time reported on november 26 2008 in cable 08damascus847a to washington and leaked to wikileaks whether or not this was a wise decision we now know that the syrian government made the situation much worse by its next action lured by the high price of wheat on the world market it sold its reserves in 2006 according to the us department of agriculture it sold 1500000 metric tons or twice as much as in the previous year the next year it had little left to export in 2008 and for the rest of the drought years it had to import enough wheat to keep its citizens alive so tens of thousands of frightened angry hungry and impoverished former farmers flooded constituted a tinder that was ready to catch fire the spark was struck on march 15 2011 when a relatively small group gathered in the town of daraa to protest against government failure to help them instead of meeting with the protestors and at least hearing their complaints the government cracked down on them as subversives the assads who had ruled the country since 1971 were not known for political openness or popular sensitivity and their action backfired riots broke out all over the country as they did the assads attempted to quell them with military force they failed to do so and as outside help money from the gulf states and muslim freedom fighters from the rest of the world poured into the country the government lost control over 30 of the countrys rural areas and perhaps half of its population you can follow the rest of the trail right up to present day and the mess we now find ourself in with the us president prepared to go to war after a chemical weapons attack said by the obama administration if not proven with evidence to the public to have been launched by the assad regime after two years of civil war and more than 100000 killed in the process while climate change did not create the fundamental instability in countries like syria sinclair explains it is adding a new dynamic to the game it is as the dept of defense now describes it a threat multiplier finally sinclair goes on to cite this prescient perhaps even haunting at this point warning from then senator john kerry in january of 2010 in response to the pentagons quadrennial defense review qdr that year as reported at the time by the hill emphasis added see sinclair at climatecrockscom for much more on this including his own prescient warnings on video they are the type of warnings as he notes which are routinely ignored by the msm and even by snarky environmental news reporters like myself who have to put it very kindly not done a terribly effective job of putting this aspect of the problem in context hattip to toooccasional brad blog guest blogger dr tucker",

            "body": "climate change news climate change news for july 2014 cc news for july 2014 al gore posted an important and inspiring article in the june 18 issue of rolling stone titled the turning point new hope for the climate its time to accelerate the shift toward a lowcarbon future here are some selected parts in the struggle to solve the climate crisis a powerful largely unnoticed shift is taking place the forward journey for human civilization will be difficult and dangerous but it is now clear that we will ultimately prevail the only question is how quickly we can accelerate and complete the transition to a lowcarbon civilization there will be many times in the decades ahead when we will have to take care to guard against despair lest it become another form of denial paralyzing action it is true that we have waited too long to avoid some serious damage to the planetary ecosystem – some of it unfortunately irreversible yet the truly catastrophic damages that have the potential for ending civilization as we know it can still – almost certainly – be avoided moreover the pace of the changes already set in motion can still be moderated significantly the utilities are fighting back of course by using their wealth and the entrenched political power they have built up over the past century in the united states brothers charles and david koch who run koch industries the secondlargest privately owned corporation in the us have secretively donated at least 70 million to a number of opaque political organizations tasked with spreading disinformation about the climate crisis and intimidating political candidates who dare to support renewable energy or the pricing of carbon pollution emphasis added the second reality ignored by the koch brothers is the one they least like to discuss the one they spend so much money trying to obfuscate with their hired merchants of doubt you want to talk about the uncompensated use of infrastructure what about sewage infrastructure for 98 million tons per day of gaseous heattrapping waste that is daily released into our skies threatening the future of human civilization is it acceptable to use the thin shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet as an open sewer free of charge really just as the extremeweather events we are now experiencing are exactly the kind that were predicted by scientists decades ago the scientific community is now projecting far worse extremeweather events in the years to come eighty percent of the warming in the past 150 years since the burning of carbonbased fuels gained momentum has occurred in the past few decades and it is worth noting that the previous scientific projections consistently lowballed the extent of the global­warming consequences that later took place – for a variety of reasons rooted in the culture of science that favor conservative estimates of future effects the us military has taken notice of the strategic dangers inherent in the climate crisis last march a pentagon advisory committee described the climate crisis as a catalyst for conflict that may well cause failures of governance and societal collapse in the past the thinking was that climate change multiplied the significance of a situation said retired air force gen charles f wald now were saying its going to be a direct cause of instability in november 1936 winston churchill stood before the united kingdoms house of commons and placed a period at the end of the misguided debate over the nature of the gathering storm on the other side of the english channel owing to past neglect in the face of the plainest warnings we have entered upon a period of danger the era of procrastination of half measures of soothing and baffling expedience of delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences we can not avoid this period we are in it now we have the policy tools that can dramatically accelerate the transition to clean energy that market forces will eventually produce at a slower pace the most important has long since been identified we have to put a price on carbon in our markets and we need to eliminate the massive subsidies that fuel the profligate emissions of globalwarming pollution emphasis added it will be essential for the united states and other major historical emitters to commit to strong action the us is finally now beginning to shift its stance and the european union has announced its commitment to achieve a 40percent reduction in co2 emissions by 2030 some individual european nations are acting even more aggressively including finlands pledge to reduce emissions 80 percent by 2050 is there enough time yes damage has been done and the period of consequences will continue for some time to come but there is still time to avoid the catastrophes that most threaten our future each of the trends described above – in technology business economics and politics – represents a break from the past taken together they add up to genuine and realistic hope that we are finally putting ourselves on a path to solve the climate crisis the ny times for june 22 had an excellent opinion piece by henry paulson secretary of the treasury from 2006 to 2009 and a republican businessman titled the coming climate crash in it he draws an analogy between the crash of the financial markets in 2008 and the threat of a coming climate crash he wrote for too many years we failed to rein in the excesses building up in the nations financial markets when the credit bubble burst in 2008 the damage was devastating millions suffered many still do were making the same mistake today with climate change were staring down a climate bubble that poses enormous risks to both our environment and economy the warning signs are clear and growing more urgent as the risks go unchecked we need to act now even though there is much disagreement including from members of my own republican party on how to address this issue while remaining economically competitive theyre right to consider the economic implications but we must not lose sight of the profound economic risks of doing nothing the solution can be a fundamentally conservative one that will empower the marketplace to find the most efficient response we can do this by putting a price on emissions of carbon dioxide — a carbon tax emphasis added few in the united states now pay to emit this potent greenhouse gas into the atmosphere we all share putting a price on emissions will create incentives to develop new cleaner energy technologies its true that the united states cant solve this problem alone but were not going to be able to persuade other big carbon polluters to take the urgent action thats needed if were not doing everything we can do to slow our carbon emissions and mitigate our risks on june 24 the risky business report the economic risks of climate change in the united states was released the news release says the us economy faces significant risks from unmitigated climate change the risky business report presents a new approach to understanding these risks for key us business sectors and provides business leaders with a framework for measuring and mitigating their own exposure to climate risk henry m paulson jr michael r bloomberg thomas p steyer and the members of the risk committee released the report on june 24 at the palace hotel in new york city watch the 405minute video of the event here in the video mayor bloomberg says we need smart rapid prudent action the report looks at climate risks by region and by industry the introduction of the executive summary says the american economy faces multiple and significant risks from climate change climate conditions vary dramatically across the us as does the mix of economic activity those variations will benefit our economic resilience to future climatic changes but each region of the country has a different risk profile and a different ability to manage that risk there is no single topline number that represents the cost of climate change to the american economy as a whole we must take a regional approach to fully understand our climate risk given the range and extent of the climate risks the american economy faces it is clear that staying on our current path will only increase our exposure the us climate is paying the price today for business decisions made many years ago especially through increased coastal storm damage and more extreme heat in parts of the country every year that goes by without a comprehensive public and private sector response to climate change is a year that locks in future climate events that will have a far more devastating effect on our local regional and national economies moreover both government and the private sector are making investment decisions today— whether in property longterm infrastructure or regional and national supply chains—that will be directly affected by climate change in decades to come our assessment finds that if we act now the us can still avoid most of the worst impacts and significantly reduce the odds of costly climate outcomes—but only if we start changing our business and public policy practices today on june 30 epa issued a new policy statement on climate change adaptation pdf 3 pages as part of federal and epa climate adaptation programs in addition to epa and federal interagency efforts including the interagency climate change adaptation task force and the us global change research program the web site describes adaptation efforts within individual federal agencies including the department of defense dod that section says in the 2010 quadrennial defense review dod establishes that climate change will affect dod in two broad ways first climate change will shape the operating environment roles and missions that dod undertakes additionally dod will need to adjust to the impacts of climate change on its facilities and military capabilities at a july

states green for those with governors who believe climate change science and are taking strong steps to address it orange for those who say they accept the science but havent done much red who are not on record with their views on the science and are weak on addressing it and stripped red for those who deny the science and oppose addressing climate change or developing clean energy sources the article points out that most of the action to address climate change has taken place at the state level with california in the lead meanwhile governor rick perry rtexas has reiterated time and again that hes not afraid to call himself a climate change denier yet his home state has suffered more climatefueled disasters than any other with an astounding 58 climatefueled disaster declarations since

virginia so rapidly that its leaders are forgetting to bicker about climate change she wrote the usual us partisan divisions over climate change were absent today in the state of virginia where

warnings of science and the mixed response of the obama administration he writes in order to put pressure on all the negotiators un secretarygeneral ban kimoon has invited world leaders to new york in

alex abdunnabi have an article in the july 16 issue of the washington post wonkblog titled the epas carbon plan asks the least from states that pollute the most it says that the carbon emission reduction goals in the epas clean power plan announced on june 2 vary greatly from state to state from 1057 to 7189 depending on a complex formula that takes into account how expensive and how difficult it will be for each state to reduce its carbon emissions from its electricitygenerating power plants the article has an interactive graphic that shows the goal the epa has set for each state and the percentages of each states power from coal natural gas nuclear and nonhydro renewable energy sources you might be surprised to find that the lowest goal 1057 is for north dakota while gets 78 of its power from coal the most carbon intensive power source while the highest 7189 is for washington state which gets only 3 of its power from coal this is hardly a war on coal at

warming denial and speaking english he cites the results of a recent public opinion study in 20 countries in which one of the questions asked was to what extent to you agree or disagree the climate change we are currently seeing is largely the result of human activity the agreement as shown in a bar chart was highest in china 91 argentina and italy and lowest in the us 57 great britain and australia the cause is probably not the major language spoken indeed the english language media in three of these four countries are linked together by a single individual rupert murdoch an apparent climate skeptic or lukewarmer murdoch is the chair of news corp and 21st century fox you can watch him express his climate views here and media arent the only reason that denialist arguments are more readily available in the english language theres also the anglophone nations concentration of climate skeptic think tanks which provide the arguments and rationalizations necessary to feed this antiscience position according to a study in climatic change earlier this year the us is home to 91 different organizations think tanks advocacy groups and trade associations that collectively comprise a climate change countermovement the annual funding of these organizations collectively is just over 900 million that is a truly massive amount of englishspeaking climate skeptic activity and while the study was limited to the us it is hard to imagine that anything comparable exists in nonenglish speaking countries eesis newsletter is intended for all interested parties particularly the

the environmental protection agencys epa new proposed carbon dioxide regulations twentynine percent of americans do not support the new regulations which would limit carbon dioxide co2 emissions from the power sector the poll also showed that nearly 60 percent of americans would be willing to pay a higher price for electricity if it meant utility companies were cutting co2 emissions the poll reported that 61 percent of americans believe climate change is happening and there should be some sort of action to reduce its effects this number is up from 54 percent five years ago the new epa regulations are still contentious because of the possible costs and effects on the coal industry the epa has stated that the health and economic benefits will outweigh these costs for more information see four former epa chiefs push for action on climate change on june 18 the senate environment and public works subcommittee on clean air and nuclear safety held a hearing entitled climate change the need to act now the witnesses were all former heads of the environmental protection agency epa under republican administrations the honorable william ruckelshaus who served under presidents nixon and reagan the honorable lee thomas who served under president reagan the honorable william reilly who served under president george hw bush and the honorable christine todd whitman who served under president george w bush according to whitman there are a lot of republicans that do believe that the climate is changing and humans play a role in that if they hear from the public that this is an issue of importance to them youre going to find more and more of them speaking out ruckelshaus seconded this sentiment citing a recent nbc newswall street journal poll which found the majority of the american public supports climate action saying that poll is indicative of what seems to be a shift in public opinion on that and if that turns into a demand for action something will happen for more information see california discusses how to spend the 5 billion in annual capandtrade revenue on june 15 california state lawmakers passed their state budget allocating the capandtrade revenue

sticker on gas pump on june 12 berkeley citys community environmental advisory commission approved a proposal to mandate climate warning labels on gas pumps if the city council approves this proposal in the coming months berkeley will become the first city in the nation to require warning stickers on gas pumps that inform consumers that the state has concluded that carbon dioxide co2 emissions contribute to global warming the idea was modeled on warnings on cigarette packaging a statement on the proposed design reads california has determined that global warming caused by co2 emissions poses a serious threat to the economic wellbeing public health natural resources and the environment of california councilman kriss worthington said its a perfect opportunity to remind people that there are greenhouse gas impacts and there are alternatives id be happy for every other city to do it first and we could be 101st but so far it looks like were on track to be the first campaign manager jamie brooks commented we want to connect cause and effect for consumers however catherine reheisboyd president of the petroleum association opposed the proposal by sending a letter to the commission stating that the plan would violate gas station owners first amendment rights rehisboyd explained though the proposed ordinance calls these messages warnings they are in reality forced reproductions of the states and citys policy opinions but the messages are not purely factual and uncontroversial information – they touch on issues that represent some of the most contentious issues in existence today for more information see note this is an interesting idea to post warning signs at gas pumps like the warning signs we now see on packs of cigarettes people somehow need to learn

change according to the report the current model used by organizations such as the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc to predict the impact of climate change on economies known as the dice model has serious limitations including an overly simplistic view of economic growth dietz and stern have developed a new model that includes a more complete analysis of how economies work climate sensitivity and the risk and implications of extreme weather events on both the environment and economies it is extremely important to understand the severe limitations of standard economic models such as those cited in the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report which have made assumptions that simply do not reflect current knowledge about climate change and its potential impacts on the economy said stern models that assume that catastrophic damages are not possible fail to take account of the magnitude of the issues and the implications of the science for additional

foundation urging energy generators to examine their vulnerability to climate change the report found that energy systems and electricity distribution networks are particularly vulnerable to floods and droughts – but with precautions to ensure power plants are protected from water shortages and by building resilience into the grid the worst could be avoided climate change is certain to impact the energy sector said christoph frei secretary general of the wec we need robust and transparent policy frameworks to unlock the longterm investments that are urgently needed to deliver the future we want leadership will be required at all levels for more information senators to introduce bipartisan bill to cut hfcs black carbon and methane on june 26 senators chris murphy dct and susan collins rme announced their plans to introduce the super pollutants act of 2014 to cut shortlived climate pollutants slcps by requiring the administration to establish a task force to review specific policies and laws to reduce black carbon methane and highgwp hydrofluorocarbons hfcs slcps currently account for 40 percent or more of global warming and last for a shorter period of time in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide so emissions cuts in slcps reduce warming significantly in the short term the act calls for the us agency for international development to prioritize black carbon mitigation activities as part of aid distribution activities and to give special emphasis to projects that reduce substantial environmental damage furthermore technical guidance will be provided to other countries on containment of emissions from gas drilling landfills coal mining and agriculture when engaging with other governments including trade delegations under the auspices of department of states global shale gas initiative the super pollutants act will accelerate and coordinate administration efforts already underway to reduce slcps said durwood zaelke president of the institute for governance sustainable development and this will reinforce the presidents international leadership on this critical climate strategy its essential to reduce slcps along with carbon dioxide to keep the climate within safe bounds the proposed legislation will reinforce the administrations international efforts to reduce slcps the secretary of state is directed to help the international community with efforts such as providing vehicle manufacturers with lowemission engine designs to reduce black carbon emissions and establishing partnerships to reduce black carbon in the arctic for more information

a satellite to track carbon dioxide co2 on the global scale the twoyear mission of the orbiting carbon observatory2 oco2 will indicate where co2 is being released into the atmosphere as well as where it is being reabsorbed on the planets surface while half of emitted co2 stays in the atmosphere the other half falls back to the surface and is reabsorbed by forests and oceans the amount of co2 that is reabsorbed by the earth however is variable from year to year and it is unclear how plants have kept pace with increased emissions understanding what controls that variability is really crucial if we can do that today it might inform us about what might happen in the future said oco2 project manager ralph basilio the oco2 will measure the relative intensities of light bouncing off the earth in

of epas power plant regulations outweigh costs on july 13 the analysis group released a study concerning the costs of the environmental protection agencys epa proposed regulations to reduce carbon pollution from existing power plants according to the report there will be some costs associated with cutting carbon dioxide co2 from plants but the impacts on electricity rates from welldesigned co2pollution control programs will be modest in the near term and can be accompanied by longterm benefits in the form of lower electricity bills and positive economic value to states and regional economies the analysis found that the flexibility of epas plan will allow states to utilize different programs and policy tools but that distribution of costs and benefits among consumers power plant operators and the economy will largely depend on how the compliance plans are designed according to susan tierney a senior advisor with the analysis group and one of the authors of the report several

and rev kathy price history sometimes takes a long time to heal itself the course corrections are often patchworked together over decades how long will prejudice blind the visions of men darken their understanding and drive brighteyed wisdom from her sacred throne dr martin luther king jr asked in a famous speech in montgomery alabama on the steps of the state capitol after completing the march from selma to montgomery in 1965 later in the speech he answered the question with his trademark eloquence how long not long because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice a few years before kings speech 28 methodist ministers of the then allwhite mississippi conference issued a statement called born of conviction written in response to the violent and fatal riots stirred by the admission of james meredith a courageous black student to the university of mississippi in 1962 our lord jesus christ teaches that all men are brothers read the statement published three months after the violent protests surrounding merediths admission he permits no discrimination because of race color or creed to modern day sensibilities the statement does not read like a radical manifesto it was birthed out of the signers frustration that leaders in their conference were tragically mute when it came to responding to the racial violence someone needed to issue a pastoral and prophetic christian response in the wake of bloody turmoil on june 9 2013 the mississippi annual conference officially recognized the men who envisioned the long arc toward justice so long ago fifty years after the document was signed the commission on religion and race of the mississippi conference honored the 28 ministers with an award established in honor of emma elzy an african american methodist laywoman who spent her life as a racial relations advocate myrlie evers wife of slain civil rights activist medgar evers presented the award to the revs maxie dunnam and keith tonkel on behalf of all the signers fifteen of the ministers who signed the document are still alive the introduction of the 1963 statement read confronted with the grave crises precipitated by racial discord within our state in recent months and the genuine dilemma facing persons of christian conscience we are compelled to voice publicly our convictions indeed as christian ministers and as native mississippians sharing the anguish of our people we have a particular obligation to speak in mississippi parlance all hell broke loose dunnam told me when i asked about his experience in his roles as world editor of the upper room president of asbury theological seminary senior pastor of christ um church in memphis president of the world methodist council and cofounder of the confessing movement i have known maxie dunnam personally and professionally for many years despite our lengthy friendship i had no idea about this chapter of his life all i knew was that we both had roots in the californiapacific annual conference i just had no idea how or why he landed in southern california unfortunately the mississippi annual conference was crippled by internal ecclesiastical politics making it impossible for the conference to speak with one voice on any issue dunnam recalled to keep our statement out of that political arena we four writers of the statement decided we would invite only younger clergy to join us in issuing the statement to the conference and the public we wanted the issues to be kept clear twentyfour others joined us in signing at the time of the documents publication in the mississippi methodist advocate dunnam was the organizing pastor of a church in gulfport he joined with three other ministers to write the document at his river camp in southern mississippi it was a bombshell in white mississippi methodism and in white mississippi dr joseph t reiff a professor at emory henry college in virginia told good news all the daily newspapers reported on it because it was the most public statement that went against the belief that all whites in mississippi wanted segregation it was a crack in the wall of supposed unanimity among mississippi whites reported reiff a united methodist minister who grew up in mississippi who is writing a book about the statement after the ole miss debacle september 30october 1 1962 these 28 ministers believed that someone needed to say publicly that this was not true and they were frustrated that their bishop and conference leaders – the white mississippi conference which was the southern half of the state then – had said nothing in response to the ole miss riotinsurrection although the statement was written by four primary ministers it was not generally known who had written it when it was published reiff said thus all 28 signers deserve equal credit for the statement some had a harder time than others in the aftermath none had it easy over the next few years many of the signers were compelled to leave mississippi and serve in other areas throughout the united states because of public and private threats and condemnation dunnam and seven others found a new home in california eight of the clergymen served their ministerial tenure in mississippi beard on june 9 the revs keith tonkel and maxie dunnam received recognition of prophetic foresight and fortitude i have no notion about whether we deserve to be honored but it is good to know that memory sometimes serves us well dunnam said it is in moments like these that we remember the heroes of the civil rights movement and the tremendous sacrifice of all those who worked suffered and strived for racial justice we remember this all in the light of dr kings observation that the moral arc bends toward justice maxie dunnam was one of the early prophets in mississippi in a time when most clergy remained silent in the face of racial inequality said memphis bishop william t mcalilly a mississippi native he and his colleagues who were willing to speak truth to power gave courage to many to all the men and their families who were honored we say thank you steve beard is the editor of good news",

subtle references to one of the most pressing issues in science how human activities primarily emissions from coal oil and gas plants are contributing to a rapid warming of the planet at the guardian graham readfearn has reported anecdotally on what really annoys scientists about the state of the climatechange debate he quotes nine researchers for instance andrew pitman—director of the australian research councils centre of excellence for climate system science university of new south wales sydney—observes many people who would not dream to claim they understand how antibiotics microprocessors or immunisations work seem happy to wax lyrical on their views on climate change michael mann director of penn states earth system science center told readfearn that if theres one concept that is typically misrepresented in the public discourse on climate change it is the concept of uncertainty he added there are uncertainties in model projections of future climate change however these uncertainties cut both ways and in many cases it appears that model projections have underestimated the rate and magnitude of the climate changes resulting from our burning of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere the rapid lost sic of arctic sea ice is one such example rather than being cause for inaction uncertainty is a reason to act all the sooner none of the nine mentioned the ubiquitous canard recycled recently by syndicated columnist walter e williams who wrote are you for or against global warming later renamed climate change and more recently renamed climate disruption environmentalists have renamed it because they dont want to look silly in the face of cooling temperatures but in fact environmentalists consider the underlying canard about cooling temperatures itself to be silly moreover even the climateskeptical opinion page of the wall street journal nowadays regularly uses the phrase climate change according to a new york times article president obama recently imputed something like silliness to climate disbelievers in a commencement speech at the university of california irvine he reportedly used gleefully sarcastic terms to ridicule congressional deniers so whats the technopolitical outlook two veteran sounders of the climate alarm bill mckibben and al gore have recently expressed optimism the opening paragraph of mckibben s new york review of books commentary dwells first on alarm we may be entering the highstakes endgame on climate change the pieces—technological and perhaps political—are finally in place for rapid powerful action to shift us off of fossil fuel unfortunately the players may well decide instead to simply move pawns back and forth for another couple of decades which would be fatal even more unfortunately the natural world is daily making it more clear that the clock ticks down faster than we feared the whole game is very nearly in check but optimism arrives in mckibbens closing a remarkably hopeful statistic comes from germany there in the one country that has taken climate change seriously and done the work to change its energy infrastructure a new record for renewable energy was set on one recent afternoon germany generated 74 percent of its electric needs from renewable sources in rolling stone former vice president gore has contributed a long article titled the turning point new hope for the climate it begins in the struggle to solve the climate crisis a powerful largely unnoticed shift is taking place the forward journey for human civilization will be difficult and dangerous but it is now clear that we will ultimately prevail the only question is how quickly we can accelerate and complete the transition to a lowcarbon civilization concerning technological advances gore says • our ability to convert sunshine into usable energy has become much cheaper far more rapidly than anyone had predicted • a decentralized grid will evolve fast involving rooftop solar cells onsite and grid battery storage and microgrids • the cost of battery storage is declining steadily—even before the introduction of disruptive new battery technologies that are now in

as leapfrogging it altogether • the cost of wind energy is also plummeting having dropped 43 percent in the united states since 2009—making it now cheaper than coal for new generating capacity concerning the economics and politics of climate he says • political forces seeking to choke the development of alternative energy will fail • carbon emissions must be made costly and the massive subsidies that fuel the profligate emissions of globalwarming pollution must be eliminated • belatedly but luckily president obama has taken hold of the climate challenge with determination and seriousness of purpose • more and more investors are diversifying their portfolios to include significant investments in renewables a growing number of large investors have announced decisions to divest themselves from carbon­intensive assets and what about media coverage that questions opposes or attacks scientists climate consensus a washington times editorial and several other media pieces including a widely published column by cal thomas publicized charges by blogger steven goddard that historical temperature records have been distorted to bolster the consensus on that basis the editorial mocks what it calls the global warming scam and asserts the planetary thermometer hasnt budged in 15 years wildfires tornadoes hurricanes and other extreme weather events are at normal or belownormal levels pacific islands arent submerged theres so much ice the polar bears are celebrating but politifact has investigated goddards post by consulting experts even including climate skeptic anthony watts heres politifacts conclusion as for what the blog said we found that experts across the spectrum found fundamental flaws in its analytic methods by relying on raw data it ignored that the number and location of weather stations and the methods of measuring temperatures across the united states have changed greatly over the past 80 years the experts we reached or whose work we read generally agree that the corrections for flawed data produce valid results the bare bones approach used in the blog post provides no solution to the issues of weaknesses in the raw data we rate the claim pants on fire steven t corneliussen a media analyst for the american institute of physics monitors three national newspapers the weeklies nature and science and occasionally other publications

            "body": "who is responsible for tackling climate change sos children since it began in late 18th century europe industrial production has spread around the world and reshaped human society it has created rapid technological progress and led to general improvements in quality of life for hundreds of millions of people however there is now almost universal acceptance that the increased levels of carbon dioxide and other socalled greenhouse gases which accompany industrialisation are also leading to changes in the earths climate action needed the main effect has been that the suns radiation is unable to exit the earths atmosphere as it is trapped by greenhouse gas particles this has already led to an increase in average temperatures around the world which in turn is leading to changes in climate conditions more broadly in 2009 experts from countries around the world agreed that action should be taken to prevent a rise of more than 2°c when compared to the preindustrial average unfortunately no plan to accomplish this was never agreed and now it is becoming clear that we are unlikely to achieve this goal these changes wont look anything like hollywoods vision of a world completely covered in water or a rapid ice age across the northern hemisphere however sea levels will almost certainly rise further as the ice caps melt and weather is already becoming more extreme increasingly people are focusing on how to adapt to these changing conditions but this is only serving to highlight global inequalities climate change is already causing extreme weather conditions around the world making it an urgent issue to address some more vulnerable whilst every country will be affected by climate change richer countries such as the netherlands will be able to invest in technology to help mitigate its effects in contrast poorer nations like bangladesh do not have the resources to soften the impact of the changing environment the sad truth is that limited resources make people in these countries more vulnerable to the effects of climate change and less able to adapt to them the devastation created by storms in southeast asia and the regular famine caused by droughts in subsaharan africa are just early examples of a trend that is likely to continue bearing in mind the widespread harm climate change will cause to people around the world the lack of coordinated action is worrying as is so often the case this has little to do with human inability and is instead the result of political and economic dynamics not least of these is the divide between the countries that historically created the problem and those that need to act to solve it the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are largely the result of industrial growth in the relatively wealthy countries of europe and north america this process drove improvements in quality of life for people in these countries so it is unsurprising that many others have since followed this lead limiting emissions in developing countries may impact industrialisation and peoples livelihoods industrialisation a doubleedged sword now global emissions predominantly come from developing countries and this is likely to grow further still tackling climate change relies on developing countries limiting their emissions but is it really fair to ask them to pay for a problem others have created especially when peoples livelihoods are at stake rapid industrial growth in china has already lifted millions out of poverty and other countries like south korea exemplify the positive effect that industrialisation can have there are real worries that stifling industrial growth particularly in very large countries like china and india could have a disastrous effect on the poorest sections of these societies simplistic approaches to limiting greenhouse gas emissions could have just such an effect so agreeing where the burden for reducing emissions falls is a tricky process especially when it is often the same people who suffer whether through extreme weather or rapid economic decline shared responsibility both industrialising and industrialised countires need to be responsible for cutting emissions and investing in renewable energy fortunately there are encouraging signs that people and governments in developing nations take these issues very seriously china which currently has the largest emissions footprint of any country is leading the world in renewable energy investment equally many poor people are adapting to the lack of national grids in their country by turning to smallscale wind and solar energy there is no reason why late industrialising countries need to make the same mistakes as their predecessors but this does not mean that industrialised nations can shirk their responsibilities tackling climate change is not just about curbing rampant consumption it strikes to the heart of beliefs about developmental opportunities ensuring equity in negotiating plans to limit greenhouse gas emissions is therefore essential unfortunately whilst this is necessary to achieve lasting and effective change it is unlikely to speed up an already slow process if youve enjoyed this blog why not sign up to our monthly email newsletter to get more thoughtprovoking comment straight to your inbox",

sind noch nicht berücksichtigt aber mit blick auf die großen unternehmen sind die zahlen ziemlich exakt allein die beiden topunternehmen lukoil russland und exxonmobil usa sitzen auf reserven die 40 milliarden tonnen co2 entsprechen die 2795 milliarden tonnen stehen auf dem tisch wie eine dose bier aus dem supermarkt die dose ist geöffnet und wartet nur noch darauf getrunken zu werden öl gas und kohle sind zwar noch im boden aber ökonomisch gesehen sind sie längst in aktienkurse oder als gegenwert von unternehmensanleihen eingepreist und viele staaten haben die einnahmen fest in

ausgebeutet werden darum wird tausende meter unter dem meer nach öl gebohrt darum wird in den appalachen nach gas gefrackt wenn man exxon oder lukoil verbieten würde ihre reserven zu fördern wären die

taking place the forward journey for human civilization will be difficult and dangerous but it is now clear that we will ultimately prevail the only question is how quickly we can accelerate and complete the transition to a lowcarbon civilization there will be many times in the decades ahead when we will have to take care to guard against despair lest it become another form of denial paralyzing action it is true that we have waited too long to avoid some serious damage to the planetary ecosystem – some of it unfortunately irreversible yet the truly catastrophic damages that have the potential for ending civilization as we know it can still – almost certainly – be avoided moreover the pace of the changes already set in motion can still be moderated significantly global warmings terrifying new math there is surprising – even shocking – good news our ability to convert sunshine into usable energy has become much cheaper far more rapidly than anyone had predicted the cost of electricity from photovoltaic or pv solar cells is now equal to or less than the cost of electricity from other sources powering electric grids in at least 79 countries by 2020 – as the scale of deployments grows and the costs continue to decline – more than 80 percent of the worlds people will live in regions where solar will be competitive with electricity from other sources no matter what the large carbon polluters and their ideological allies say or do in markets there is a huge difference between more expensive than and cheaper than not unlike the difference between 32 degrees and 33 degrees fahrenheit its not just a difference of a degree its the difference between a market thats frozen up and one thats liquid as a result all over the world the executives of companies selling electricity generated from the burning of carbonbased fuels primarily from coal are openly discussing their growing fears of a utility death spiral germany europes industrial powerhouse where renewable subsidies have been especially high now generates 37 percent of its daily electricity from wind and solar and analysts predict that number will rise to 50 percent by 2020 indeed one day this year renewables created 74 percent of the nations electricity scorched earth how climate change is spreading drought throughout the globe whats more germanys two largest coalburning utilities have lost 56 percent of their value over the past four years and the losses have continued into the first half of 2014 and its not just germany last year the top 20 utilities throughout europe reported losing half of their value since 2008 according to the swiss bank ubs nine out of 10 european coal and gas plants are now losing money in the united states where up to 49 percent of the new generating capacity came from renewables in 2012 166 coalfired electricitygenerating plants have either closed or have announced they are closing in the past four and a half years an additional 183 proposed new coal plants have been canceled since 2005 to be sure some of these closings have been due to the substitution of gas for coal but the transition under way in both the american and global energy markets is far more significant than one fossil fuel replacing another we are witnessing the beginning of a massive shift to a new energydistribution model – from the central station utilitygrid model that goes back to the 1880s to a widely distributed model with rooftop solar cells onsite and grid battery storage and microgrids the principal trade group representing us electric utilities the edison electric institute has identified distributed generation as the largest nearterm threat to the utility model last may barclays downgraded the entirety of the us electric sector warning that a confluence of declining cost trends in distributed solar­photovoltaicpower generation and residential­scale power storage is likely to disrupt the status quo and make utility investments less attractive see the 10 dumbest things said about global warming this year citigroup reported that the widespread belief that natural gas – the supply of which has ballooned in the us with the fracking of shale gas – will continue to be the chosen alternative to coal is mistaken because it too will fall victim to the continuing decline in the cost of solar and wind electricity significantly the cost of battery storage long considered a barrier to the new electricity system has also been declining steadily – even before the introduction of disruptive new battery technologies that are now in advanced development along with the impressive gains of cleanenergy programs in the past decade there have been similar improvements in our ability to do more with less since 1980 the us has reduced total energy intensity by 49 percent i t is worth remembering this key fact about the supply of the basic fuel enough raw energy reaches the earth from the sun in one hour to equal all of the energy used by the entire world in a full year in poorer countries where most of the worlds people live and most of the growth in energy use is occurring photovoltaic electricity is not so much displacing carbonbased energy as leapfrogging it altogether in his first days in office the government of the newly elected prime minister of india narendra modi who has authored an ebook on global warming announced a stunning plan to rely principally upon photovoltaic energy in providing electricity to 400 million indians who currently do not have it one of modis supporters sl rao the former utility regulator of india added that the industry he once oversaw has reached a stage where either we change the whole system quickly or it will collapse nor is india an outlier neighboring bangladesh is installing nearly two new rooftop pv systems every minute — making it the most rapidly growing market for pvs in the world in west and east africa solarelectric cells are beginning what is widely predicted to be a period of explosive growth at the turn of the 21st century some scoffed at projections that the world would be installing one gigawatt of new solar electricity per year by 2010 that goal was exceeded 17 times over last year it was exceeded 39 times over and this year the world is on pace to exceed that benchmark as much as 55 times over in may china announced that by 2017 it would have the capacity to generate 70 gigawatts of photovoltaic electricity the state with by far the biggest amount of wind energy is texas not historically known for its progressive energy policies the cost of wind energy is also plummeting having dropped 43 percent in the united states since 2009 – making it now cheaper than coal for new generating capacity though the downward cost curve is not quite as steep as that for solar the projections in 2000 for annual worldwide wind deployments by the end of that decade were exceeded seven times over and are now more than 10 times that figure in the united states alone nearly onethird of all new electricitygenerating capacity in the past five years has come from wind and installed wind capacity in the us has increased more than fivefold since 2006 for consumers this good news may soon get even better while the cost of carbon­based energy continues to increase the cost of solar electricity has dropped by an average of 20 percent per year since 2010 some energy economists including those who produced an authoritative report this past spring for bernstein research are now predicting energyprice deflation as soon as the next decade for those including me who are surprised at the speed with which this impending transition has been accelerating there are precedents that help explain it remember the first mobiletelephone handsets i do as an inveterate early adopter of new technologies i thought those first huge clunky cellphones were fun to use and looked cool they look silly now of course in 1980 a few years before i bought one of the early models att conducted a global market study and came to the conclusion that by the year 2000 there would be a market for 900000 subscribers they were not only wrong they were way wrong 109 million contracts were active in 2000 barely a decade and a half later there are 68 billion globally these parallels have certainly caught the attention of the fossilfuel industry and its investors eighteen months ago the edison electric institute described the floundering state of the onceproud landlinetelephone companies as a grim predictor of what may soon be their fate t he utilities are fighting back of course by using their wealth and the entrenched political power they have built up over the past century in the united states brothers charles and david koch who run koch industries the secondlargest privately owned corporation in the us have secretively donated at least 70 million to a number of opaque political organizations tasked with spreading disinformation about the climate crisis and intimidating political candidates who dare to support renewable energy or the pricing of carbon pollution a call to arms an invitation to demand action on climate change they regularly repeat shopworn complaints about the inadequate intermittent and inconsistent subsidies that some governments have used in an effort to speed up the deployment of renewables while ignoring the fact that global subsidies for carbonbased energy are 25 times larger than global subsidies for renewables one of the most effective of the groups financed by the koch brothers and other carbon polluters is the american legislative exchange council or alec which grooms conservative state legislators throughout the country to act as their agents in introducing legislation written by utilities and carbonfuel lobbyists in a desperate effort to slow if not stop the transition to renewable energy the kochs claim to act on principles of low taxation and minimal regulation but in their attempts to choke the development of alternative energy they have induced the recipients of their generous campaign contributions to contradict these supposedly bedrock values pushing legislative and regulatory measures in 34 states to discourage solar or encourage carbon energy or both the most controversial of their initiatives is focused on persuading state legislatures and publicutility commissions to tax homeowners who install a pv solar cell on their roofs and to manipulate the byzantine utility laws and regulations to penalize renewable energy in a variety of novel schemes the chief battleground in this war between the energy systems of the past and future is our electrical grid for more than a century the grid – along with the regulatory and legal framework governing it – has been dominated by electric utilities and their centralized fossilfuelpowered­ electricitygeneration plants but the rise of distributed alternate energy sources allows consumers to participate in the production of electricity through a policy called net metering in 43 states homeowners who install solar pv to systems on their rooftops are permitted to sell electricity back into the grid when they generate more than they need these policies have been crucial to the growth of solar power but net metering represents an existential threat to the future of electric utilities the socalled utility death spiral as more consumers install solar panels on their roofs utilities will have to raise prices on their remaining customers to recover the lost revenues those higher rates will in turn drive more consumers to leave the utility system and so on but here is more good news the koch brothers are losing rather badly in kansas their home state a poll by north star opinion research reported that 91 percent of registered voters support solar and wind threequarters supported stronger policy encouragement of renewable energy even if such policies raised their electricity bills in georgia the atlanta tea party joined forces with the sierra club to form a new organization called – wait for it – the green tea coalition which promptly defeated a kochfunded scheme to tax rooftop solar panels meanwhile in arizona after the states largest utility an alec member asked the publicutility commission for a tax of up to 150 per month for solar households the opposition was fierce and wellorganized a compromise was worked out – those households would be charged just 5 per month – but barry goldwater jr the leader of a newly formed organization called tusk tell utilities solar wont be killed is fighting a new attempt to discourage rooftop solar in arizona characteristically the koch brothers and their allies have been using secretive and deceptive funding in arizona to run television advertisements attacking greedy owners of rooftop solar panels – but their effort has thus far backfired as local journalists have exposed the funding scam even though the kochfunded forces recently scored a partial and almost certainly temporary victory in ohio where the legislature voted to put a hold on the states renewableportfolio standard and study the issue for two years its clear that the attack on solar energy is too little too late last year the edison electric institute warned the utility industry that it had waited too long to respond to the sharp cost declines and growing popularity of solar at the point when utility investors become focused on these new risks and start to witness significant customer and earningserosion trends they will respond to these challenges but by then it may be too late to repair the utility business model the most seductive argument deployed by the koch brothers and their allies is that those who use rooftop solar electricity and benefit from the netmetering policies are free riders – that is they are allegedly not paying their share of the maintenance costs for the infrastructure of the old utility model including the grid itself this deceptive message especially when coupled with campaign contributions has persuaded some legislators to support the proposed new taxes on solar panels but the argument ignores two important realities facing the electric utilities first most of the excess solar electricity is supplied by owners of solar cells during peakload hours of the day when the grids capacity is most stressed – thereby alleviating the pressure to add expensive new coal or gasfired generating capacity but heres the rub what saves money for their customers cuts into the growth of their profits and depresses their stock prices as is often the case the real conflict is between the public interest and the special interest the second reality ignored by the koch brothers is the one they least like to discuss the one they spend so much money trying to obfuscate with their hired merchants of doubt you want to talk about the uncompensated use of infrastructure what about sewage infrastructure for 98 million tons per day of gaseous heattrapping waste that is daily released into our skies threatening the future of human civilization is it acceptable to use the thin shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet as an open sewer free of charge really t his after all is the reason the climate crisis has become an existential threat to the future of human civilization last april the average co2 concentrations in the earths atmosphere exceeded 400 partspermillion on a sustained basis for the first time in at least 800000 years and probably for the first time in at least 45 million years a period that was considerably warmer than at present according to a cautious analysis by the influential climate scientist james hansen the accumulated manmade globalwarming pollution already built up in the earths atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy every day as would be released by the explosion of 400000 hiroshimaclass nuclear bombs its a big planet but thats a lot of energy and it is that heat energy that is giving the earth a fever denialists hate the fever metaphor but as the american association for the advancement of science aaas pointed out this year just as a 14­degreefever change would be seen as significant in a childs body a similar change in our earths temperature is also a concern for human society thirteen of the 14 hottest years ever measured with instruments have occurred in this century this is the 37th year in a row that has been hotter than the 20thcentury average april was the 350th month in a row hotter than the average in the preceding century the past decade was by far the warmest decade ever measured many scientists expect the coming year could break all of these records by a fair margin because of the extra boost from the anticipated el niño now gathering in the waters of the eastern pacific the effects of periodic el niño events are likely to become stronger because of global warming and this one is projected by many scientists to be stronger than average perhaps on the scale of the epic el niño of 1997 to 1998 the fastgrowing number of extremeweather events connected to the climate crisis has already had a powerful impact on public attitudes toward global warming a clear majority of americans now acknowledge that manmade pollution is responsible as the storms floods mudslides droughts fires and other catastrophes become ever more destructive the arcane discussions over how much of their extradestructive force should be attributed to global warming have become largely irrelevant the public at large feels it viscerally now as bob dylan sang you dont need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows besides there is a simple difference between linear cause and effect and systemic cause and effect as one of the worlds mostrespected atmospheric scientists kevin trenberth has said the environment in which all storms form has changed owing to human activities for example when supertyphoon haiyan crossed the pacific toward the philippines last fall the storm gained strength across seas that were 54 degrees fahrenheit warmer than they used to be because of greenhouse­gas pollution as a result haiyan went from being merely strong to being the most powerful and destructive oceanbased storm on record to make landfall four million people were displaced more than twice as many as by the indian ocean tsunami of 10 years ago and there are still more than 2 million haiyan refugees desperately trying to rebuild their lives when superstorm sandy traversed the areas of the atlantic ocean windward of new york and new jersey in 2012 the water temperature was nine degrees fahrenheit warmer than normal the extra convection energy in those waters fed the storm and made the winds stronger than they would otherwise have been moreover the sea level was higher than it used to be elevated by the melting of ice in the frozen regions of the earth and the expanded volume of warmer ocean waters five years earlier denialists accused me of demagogic exaggeration in an animated scene in my documentary an inconvenient truth that showed the waters of the atlantic ocean flooding into the 911 ground zero memorial site but in sandys wake the atlantic did in fact flood ground zero – many years before scientists had expected that to occur similarly the inundation of miami beach by rising sea levels has now begun and freshwater aquifers in lowlying areas from south florida to the nile delta to bangladesh to indochina are being invaded by saltwater pushed upward by rising oceans and of course many lowlying islands – not least in the bay of bengal – are in danger of disappearing altogether where will the climate refugees go similarly the continued melting of mountain glaciers and snowpacks is according to the best scientists already affecting water supplies for as many as a billion people around the world just as the extremeweather events we are now experiencing are exactly the kind that were predicted by scientists decades ago the scientific community is now projecting far worse extremeweather events in the years to come eighty percent of the warming in the past 150 years since the burning of carbonbased fuels gained momentum has occurred in the past few decades and it is worth noting that the previous scientific projections consistently lowballed the extent of the global­warming consequences that later took place – for a variety of reasons rooted in the culture of science that favor conservative estimates of future effects in an effort to avoid these cultural biases the aaas noted this year that not only are the impacts of the climate crisis very likely to become worse over the next 10 to 20 years and beyond but there is a possibility that temperatures will rise much higher and impacts will be much worse than expected moreover as global temperature rises the risk increases that one or more important parts of the earths climate system will experience changes that may be abrupt unpredictable and potentially irreversible causing large damages and high costs just weeks after that report there was shock and for some a temptation to despair when the startling news was released in may by scientists at both nasa and the university of washington that the longfeared collapse of a portion of the west antarctic ice sheet is not only under way but is also now irreversible even as some labored to understand what the word collapse implied about the suddenness with which this catastrophe will ultimately unfold it was the word irreversible that had a deeper impact on the collective psyche just as scientists 200 years ago could not comprehend the idea that species had once lived on earth and had subsequently become extinct and just as some people still find it hard to accept the fact that human beings have become a sufficiently powerful force of nature to reshape the ecological system of our planet many – including some who had long since accepted the truth about global warming – had difficulty coming to grips with the stark new reality that one of the longfeared tipping points had been crossed and that as a result no matter what we do sea levels will rise by at least an additional three feet the uncertainty about how long the process will take some of the best ice scientists warn that a rise of 10 feet in this century can not be ruled out did not change the irreversibility of the forces that we have set in motion but as eric rignot the lead author of the nasa study pointed out in the guardian its still imperative that we take action controlling climate warming may ultimately make a difference not only about how fast west antarctic ice will melt to sea but also whether other parts of antarctica will take their turn the news about the irreversible collapse in west antarctica caused some to almost forget that only two months earlier a similar startling announcement had been made about the greenland ice sheet scientists found that the northeastern part of greenland – long thought to be resistant to melting – has in fact been losing more than 10 billion tons of ice per year for the past decade making 100 percent of greenland unstable and likely as with west antarctica to contribute to significantly more sealevel rise than scientists had previously thought t he heating of the oceans not only melts the ice and makes hurricanes cyclones and typhoons more intense it also evaporates around 2 trillion gallons of additional water vapor into the skies above the us the warmer air holds more of this water vapor and carries it over the landmasses where it is funneled into landbased storms that are releasing record downpours all over the world for example an april shower came to pensacola florida this spring but it was a freak – another rainstorm on steroids two feet of rain in 26 hours it broke all the records in the region but as usual virtually no media outlets made the connection to global warming similar once in a thousand years storms have been occurring regularly in recent years all over the world including in my hometown of nashville in may 2010 alltime record flooding swamped large portions of england this winter submerging thousands of homes for more than six weeks massive downpours hit serbia and bosnia this spring causing flooding of biblical proportions a phrase now used so frequently in the western world that it has become almost a cliché and thousands of landslides torrential rains in afghanistan in april triggered mudslides that killed thousands of people – almost as many according to relief organizations as all of the afghans killed in the war there the previous year in march persistent rains triggered an unusually large mudslide in oso washington killing more than 40 people there are literally hundreds of other examples of extreme rainfall occurring in recent years in the americas europe asia africa and oceania in the planets drier regions the same extra heat trapped in the atmosphere by manmade globalwarming pollution has also been driving faster evaporation of soil moisture and causing recordbreaking droughts as of this writing 100 percent of california is in severe extreme or exceptional drought record fires are ravaging the desiccated landscape experts now project that an increase of one degree celsius over preindustrial temperatures will lead to as much as a 600­percent increase in the median area burned by forest fires in some areas of the american west – including large portions of colorado the national research council has reported that fire season is two and a half months longer than it was 30 years ago and in california firefighters are saying that the season is now effectively yearround drought has been intensifying in many other dry regions around the world this year brazil indonesia central and northwest africa and madagascar central and western europe the middle east up to the caspian sea and north of the black sea southeast asia northeast asia western australia and new zealand syria is one of the countries that has been in the bullseye of climate change from 2006 to 2010 a historic drought destroyed 60 percent of the countrys farms and 80 percent of its livestock – driving a million refugees from rural agricultural areas into cities already crowded with the million refugees who had taken shelter there from the iraq war as early as 2008 us state department cables quoted syrian government officials warning that the social and economic impacts of the drought are beyond our capacity as a country to deal with though the hellish and ongoing civil war in syria has multiple causes – including the perfidy of the assad government and the brutality on all sides – their climaterelated drought may have been the biggest underlying trigger for the horror the us military has taken notice of the strategic dangers inherent in the climate crisis last march a pentagon advisory committee described the climate crisis as a catalyst for conflict that may well cause failures of governance and societal collapse in the past the thinking was that climate change multiplied the significance of a situation said retired air force gen charles f wald now were saying its going to be a direct cause of instability pentagon spokesman mark wright told the press for dod this is a mission reality not a political debate the scientific forecast is for more arctic ice melt more sealevel rise more intense storms more flooding from storm surge and more drought and in yet another forecast difficult for congressional climate denialists to rebut climate experts advising the military have also warned that the worlds largest naval base in norfolk virginia is likely to be inundated by rising sea levels in the future and how did the republicandominated house of representatives respond to these grim warnings by passing legislation seeking to prohibit the department of defense from taking any action to prepare for the effects of climate disruption there are so many knockon consequences of the climate crisis that listing them can be depressing – diseases spreading crop yields declining more heat waves affecting vulnerable and elderly populations the disappearance of summerice cover in the arctic ocean the potential extinction of up to half of all the living species and so much more and that in itself is a growing problem too because when you add it all up its no wonder that many feel a new inclination to despair so clearly we will just have to gird ourselves for the difficult challenges ahead there is indeed literally light at the end of the tunnel but there is a tunnel and we are well into it i n november 1936 winston churchill stood before the united kingdoms house of commons and placed a period at the end of the misguided debate over the nature of the gathering storm on the other side of the english channel owing to past neglect in the face of the plainest warnings we have entered upon a period of danger the era of procrastination of half measures of soothing and baffling expedience of delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences we can not avoid this period we are in it now our civilization is confronting this existential challenge at a moment in our historical development when our dominant global ideology – democratic capitalism – has been failing us in important respects democracy is accepted in theory by more people than ever before as the best form of political organization but it has been hacked by large corporations defined as persons by the supreme court and special interests corrupting the political system with obscene amounts of money defined as speech by the same court capitalism for its part is accepted by more people than ever before as a superior form of economic organization but is – in its current form – failing to measure and include the categories of value that are most relevant to the solutions we need in order to respond to this threatening crisis clean air and water safe food a benign climate balance public goods like education and a greener infrastructure etc pressure for meaningful reform in democratic capitalism is beginning to build powerfully the progressive introduction of internetbased communication – social media blogs digital journalism – is laying the foundation for the renewal of individual participation in democracy and the reelevation of reason over wealth and power as the basis for collective decision­making and the growing levels of inequality worldwide combined with growing structural unemployment and more frequent market disruptions like the great recession are building support for reforms in capitalism both waves of reform are still at an early stage but once again churchills words inspire if youre going through hell keep going and that is why it is all the more important to fully appreciate the incredible opportunity for salvation that is now within our grasp as the satirical newspaper the onion recently noted in one of its trademark headlines scientists politely remind world that clean energy technology ready to go whenever we have the policy tools that can dramatically accelerate the transition to clean energy that market forces will eventually produce at a slower pace the most important has long since been identified we have to put a price on carbon in our markets and we need to eliminate the massive subsidies that fuel the profligate emissions of globalwarming pollution we need to establish green banks that provide access to capital investment necessary to develop renewable energy sustainable agriculture and forestry an electrified transportation fleet the retrofitting of buildings to reduce wasteful energy consumption and the full integration of sustainability in the design and architecture of cities and towns while the burning of fossil fuels is the largest cause of the climate crisis deforestation and factory farming also play an important role financial and technological approaches to addressing these challenges are emerging but we must continue to make progress in converting to sustainable forestry and agriculture in order to accomplish these policy shifts we must not only put a price on carbon in markets but also find a way to put a price on climate denial in our politics we already know the reforms that are needed – and the political will to enact them is a renewable resource yet the necessary renewal can only come from an awakened citizenry empowered by a sense of urgency and emboldened with the courage to reject despair and become active most importantly now is the time to support candidates who accept the reality of the climate crisis and are genuinely working hard to solve it – and to bluntly tell candidates who are not on board how much this issue matters to you if you are willing to summon the resolve to communicate that blunt message forcefully – with dignity and absolute sincerity – you will be amazed at the political power an individual can still wield in americas diminished democracy s omething else is also new this summer three years ago in these pages i criticized the seeming diffidence of president obama toward the great task of solving the climate crisis this summer it is abundantly evident that he has taken hold of the challenge with determination and seriousness of purpose he has empowered his environmental protection agency to enforce limits on co2 emissions for both new and as of this june existing sources of co2 he has enforced bold new standards for the fuel economy of the us transportation fleet he has signaled that he is likely to reject the absurdly reckless keystone xlpipeline proposal for the transport of oil from carbon­intensive tar sands to be taken to market through the united states on its way to china thus effectively limiting their exploitation and he is even now preparing to impose new limits on the release of methane pollution all of these welcome steps forward have to be seen of course in the context of obamas continued advocacy of a socalled alloftheabove energy policy – which is the prevailing code for aggressively pushing more drilling and fracking for oil and gas and to put the good news in perspective it is important to remember that us emissions – after declining for five years during the slow recovery from the great recession – actually increased by 24 percent in 2013 nevertheless the president is clearly changing his overall policy emphasis to make co2 reductions a much higher priority now and has made a series of inspiring speeches about the challenges posed by climate change and the exciting opportunities available as we solve it as a result obama will go to the united nations this fall and to paris at the end of 2015 with the credibility and moral authority that he lacked during the disastrous meeting in copenhagen four and a half years ago the international treaty process has been so fraught with seemingly intractable disagreements that some parties have all but given up on the possibility of ever reaching a meaningful treaty ultimately there must be one if we are to succeed and there are signs that a way forward may be opening up in may i attended a preparatory session in abu dhabi uae organized by united nations secretary general ban kimoon to bolster commitments from governments businesses and nongovernmental organizations ahead of this septembers un climate summit the twoday meeting was different from many of the others i have attended there were welcome changes in rhetoric and it was clear that the reality of the climate crisis is now weighing on almost every nation moreover there were encouraging reports from around the world that many of the policy changes necessary to solve the crisis are being adopted piecemeal by a growing number of regional state and city governments for these and other reasons i believe there is a realistic hope that momentum toward a global agreement will continue to build in september and carry through to the paris negotiations in late 2015 t he american poet wallace stevens once wrote after the final no there comes a yesand on that yes the future world depends there were many nos before the emergence of a global consensus to abolish chattel slavery before the consensus that women must have the right to vote before the fever of the nuclear­arms race was broken before the quickening global recognition of gay and lesbian equality and indeed before every forward advance toward social progress though a great many obstacles remain in the path of this essential agreement i am among the growing number of people who are allowing themselves to become more optimistic than ever that a bold and comprehensive pact may well emerge from the paris negotiations late next year which many regard as the last chance to avoid civilizational catastrophe while there is still time it will be essential for the united states and other major historical emitters to commit to strong action the us is finally now beginning to shift its stance and the european union has announced its commitment to achieve a 40percent reduction in co2 emissions by 2030 some individual european nations are acting even more aggressively including finlands pledge to reduce emissions 80 percent by 2050 it will also be crucial for the larger developing and emerging nations – particularly china and india – to play a strong leadership role fortunately there are encouraging signs chinas new president xi jinping has launched a pilot capandtrade system in two cities and five provinces as a model for a nationwide capandtrade program in the next few years he has banned all new coal burning in several cities and required the reporting of co2 emissions by all major industrial sources china and the us have jointly reached an important agreement to limit another potent source of globalwarming pollution – the chemical compounds known as hydrofluorocarbons or hfcs and the new prime minister of india as noted earlier has launched the worlds most ambitious plan to accelerate the transition to solar electricity underlying this new breaking of logjams in international politics there are momentous changes in the marketplace that are exercising enormous influence on the perceptions by political leaders of the new possibilities for historic breakthroughs more and more investors are diversifying their portfolios to include significant investments in renewables in june warren buffett announced he was ready to double berkshire hathaways existing 15 billion investment in wind and solar energy a growing number of large investors – including pension funds university endowments stanford announced its decision in may family offices and others – have announced decisions to divest themselves from carbon­intensive assets activist and impact investors are pushing for divestment from carbon­rich assets and new investments in renewable and sustainable assets several large banks and asset managers around the world full disclosure generation investment management which i cofounded with david blood and for which i serve as chairman is in this group have advised their clients of the danger that carbon assets will become stranded a stranded asset is one whose price is vulnerable to a sudden decline when markets belatedly recognize the truth about their underlying value – just as the infamous subprime mortgages suddenly lost their value in 2007 to 2008 once investors came to grips with the fact that the borrowers had absolutely no ability to pay off their mortgages shareholder activists and public campaigners have pressed carbondependent corporations to deal with these growing concerns but the biggest ones are still behaving as if they are in denial in may 2013 exxonmobil ceo rex tillerson responded to those pointing out the need to stop using the earths atmosphere as a sewer by asking what good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers i dont even know where to start in responding to that statement but here is a clue pope francis said in may if we destroy creation creation will destroy us never forget this e xxonmobil shell and many other holders of carbonintensive assets have argued in essence that they simply do not believe that elected national leaders around the world will ever reach an agreement to put a price on carbon pollution but a prospective global treaty however likely or unlikely you think that might be is only one of several routes to overturning the fossilfuel economy rapid technological advances in renewable energy are stranding carbon investments grassroots movements are building opposition to the holding of such assets and new legal restrictions on collateral flows of pollution – like particulate air pollution in china and mercury pollution in the us – are further reducing the value of coal tar sands and oil and gas assets in its series of reports to energy investors this spring citigroup questioned the feasibility of new coal plants not only in europe and north america but in china as well although there is clearly a political struggle under way in china between regional governments closely linked to carbon­energy generators suppliers and users and the central government in beijing – which is under growing pressure from citizens angry about pollution – the nations new leadership appears to be determined to engineer a transition toward renewable energy only time will tell how successful they will be the stock exchanges in johannesburg and são paulo have decided to require the full integration of sustainability from all listed companies standard poors announced this spring that some nations vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis may soon have their bonds downgraded because of the enhanced risk to holders of those assets a growing number of businesses around the world are implementing sustainability plans as more and more consumers demand a more responsible approach from businesses they patronize significantly many have been pleasantly surprised to find that adopting efficient lowcarbon approaches can lead to major cost savings and all the while the surprising and relentless ongoing decline in the cost of renewable energy and efficiency improvements are driving the transition to a lowcarbon economy is there enough time yes damage has been done and the period of consequences will continue for some time to come but there is still time to avoid the catastrophes that most threaten our future each of the trends described above – in technology business economics and politics – represents a break from the past taken together they add up to genuine and realistic hope that we are finally putting ourselves on a path to solve the climate crisis how long will it take when martin luther king jr was asked that question during some of the bleakest hours of the us civil rights revolution he responded how long not long because no lie can live forever how long not long because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice and so it is today how long not long this story is from the july 3rd17th 2014 issue of rolling stone from the archives issue 1212 july 3 2014",

taking place the forward journey for human civilization will be difficult and dangerous but it is now clear that we will ultimately prevail the only question is how quickly we can accelerate and complete the transition to a lowcarbon civilization there will be many times in the decades ahead when we will have to take care to guard against despair lest it become another form of denial paralyzing action it is true that we have waited too long to avoid some serious damage to the planetary ecosystem – some of it unfortunately irreversible yet the truly catastrophic damages that have the potential for ending civilization as we know it can still – almost certainly – be avoided moreover the pace of the changes already set in motion can still be moderated significantly global warmings terrifying new math there is surprising – even shocking – good news our ability to convert sunshine into usable energy has become much cheaper far more rapidly than anyone had predicted the cost of electricity from photovoltaic or pv solar cells is now equal to or less than the cost of electricity from other sources powering electric grids in at least 79 countries by 2020 – as the scale of deployments grows and the costs continue to decline – more than 80 percent of the worlds people will live in regions where solar will be competitive with electricity from other sources no matter what the large carbon polluters and their ideological allies say or do in markets there is a huge difference between more expensive than and cheaper than not unlike the difference between 32 degrees and 33 degrees fahrenheit its not just a difference of a degree its the difference between a market thats frozen up and one thats liquid as a result all over the world the executives of companies selling electricity generated from the burning of carbonbased fuels primarily from coal are openly discussing their growing fears of a utility death spiral germany europes industrial powerhouse where renewable subsidies have been especially high now generates 37 percent of its daily electricity from wind and solar and analysts predict that number will rise to 50 percent by 2020 indeed one day this year renewables created 74 percent of the nations electricity scorched earth how climate change is spreading drought throughout the globe whats more germanys two largest coalburning utilities have lost 56 percent of their value over the past four years and the losses have continued into the first half of 2014 and its not just germany last year the top 20 utilities throughout europe reported losing half of their value since 2008 according to the swiss bank ubs nine out of 10 european coal and gas plants are now losing money in the united states where up to 49 percent of the new generating capacity came from renewables in 2012 166 coalfired electricitygenerating plants have either closed or have announced they are closing in the past four and a half years an additional 183 proposed new coal plants have been canceled since 2005 to be sure some of these closings have been due to the substitution of gas for coal but the transition under way in both the american and global energy markets is far more significant than one fossil fuel replacing another we are witnessing the beginning of a massive shift to a new energydistribution model – from the central station utilitygrid model that goes back to the 1880s to a widely distributed model with rooftop solar cells onsite and grid battery storage and microgrids the principal trade group representing us electric utilities the edison electric institute has identified distributed generation as the largest nearterm threat to the utility model last may barclays downgraded the entirety of the us electric sector warning that a confluence of declining cost trends in distributed solar­photovoltaicpower generation and residential­scale power storage is likely to disrupt the status quo and make utility investments less attractive see the 10 dumbest things said about global warming this year citigroup reported that the widespread belief that natural gas – the supply of which has ballooned in the us with the fracking of shale gas – will continue to be the chosen alternative to coal is mistaken because it too will fall victim to the continuing decline in the cost of solar and wind electricity significantly the cost of battery storage long considered a barrier to the new electricity system has also been declining steadily – even before the introduction of disruptive new battery technologies that are now in advanced development along with the impressive gains of cleanenergy programs in the past decade there have been similar improvements in our ability to do more with less since 1980 the us has reduced total energy intensity by 49 percent i t is worth remembering this key fact about the supply of the basic fuel enough raw energy reaches the earth from the sun in one hour to equal all of the energy used by the entire world in a full year in poorer countries where most of the worlds people live and most of the growth in energy use is occurring photovoltaic electricity is not so much displacing carbonbased energy as leapfrogging it altogether in his first days in office the government of the newly elected prime minister of india narendra modi who has authored an ebook on global warming announced a stunning plan to rely principally upon photovoltaic energy in providing electricity to 400 million indians who currently do not have it one of modis supporters sl rao the former utility regulator of india added that the industry he once oversaw has reached a stage where either we change the whole system quickly or it will collapse nor is india an outlier neighboring bangladesh is installing nearly two new rooftop pv systems every minute — making it the most rapidly growing market for pvs in the world in west and east africa solarelectric cells are beginning what is widely predicted to be a period of explosive growth at the turn of the 21st century some scoffed at projections that the world would be installing one gigawatt of new solar electricity per year by 2010 that goal was exceeded 17 times over last year it was exceeded 39 times over and this year the world is on pace to exceed that benchmark as much as 55 times over in may china announced that by 2017 it would have the capacity to generate 70 gigawatts of photovoltaic electricity the state with by far the biggest amount of wind energy is texas not historically known for its progressive energy policies the cost of wind energy is also plummeting having dropped 43 percent in the united states since 2009 – making it now cheaper than coal for new generating capacity though the downward cost curve is not quite as steep as that for solar the projections in 2000 for annual worldwide wind deployments by the end of that decade were exceeded seven times over and are now more than 10 times that figure in the united states alone nearly onethird of all new electricitygenerating capacity in the past five years has come from wind and installed wind capacity in the us has increased more than fivefold since 2006 for consumers this good news may soon get even better while the cost of carbon­based energy continues to increase the cost of solar electricity has dropped by an average of 20 percent per year since 2010 some energy economists including those who produced an authoritative report this past spring for bernstein research are now predicting energyprice deflation as soon as the next decade for those including me who are surprised at the speed with which this impending transition has been accelerating there are precedents that help explain it remember the first mobiletelephone handsets i do as an inveterate early adopter of new technologies i thought those first huge clunky cellphones were fun to use and looked cool they look silly now of course in 1980 a few years before i bought one of the early models att conducted a global market study and came to the conclusion that by the year 2000 there would be a market for 900000 subscribers they were not only wrong they were way wrong 109 million contracts were active in 2000 barely a decade and a half later there are 68 billion globally these parallels have certainly caught the attention of the fossilfuel industry and its investors eighteen months ago the edison electric institute described the floundering state of the onceproud landlinetelephone companies as a grim predictor of what may soon be their fate t he utilities are fighting back of course by using their wealth and the entrenched political power they have built up over the past century in the united states brothers charles and david koch who run koch industries the secondlargest privately owned corporation in the us have secretively donated at least 70 million to a number of opaque political organizations tasked with spreading disinformation about the climate crisis and intimidating political candidates who dare to support renewable energy or the pricing of carbon pollution a call to arms an invitation to demand action on climate change they regularly repeat shopworn complaints about the inadequate intermittent and inconsistent subsidies that some governments have used in an effort to speed up the deployment of renewables while ignoring the fact that global subsidies for carbonbased energy are 25 times larger than global subsidies for renewables one of the most effective of the groups financed by the koch brothers and other carbon polluters is the american legislative exchange council or alec which grooms conservative state legislators throughout the country to act as their agents in introducing legislation written by utilities and carbonfuel lobbyists in a desperate effort to slow if not stop the transition to renewable energy the kochs claim to act on principles of low taxation and minimal regulation but in their attempts to choke the development of alternative energy they have induced the recipients of their generous campaign contributions to contradict these supposedly bedrock values pushing legislative and regulatory measures in 34 states to discourage solar or encourage carbon energy or both the most controversial of their initiatives is focused on persuading state legislatures and publicutility commissions to tax homeowners who install a pv solar cell on their roofs and to manipulate the byzantine utility laws and regulations to penalize renewable energy in a variety of novel schemes the chief battleground in this war between the energy systems of the past and future is our electrical grid for more than a century the grid – along with the regulatory and legal framework governing it – has been dominated by electric utilities and their centralized fossilfuelpowered­ electricitygeneration plants but the rise of distributed alternate energy sources allows consumers to participate in the production of electricity through a policy called net metering in 43 states homeowners who install solar pv to systems on their rooftops are permitted to sell electricity back into the grid when they generate more than they need these policies have been crucial to the growth of solar power but net metering represents an existential threat to the future of electric utilities the socalled utility death spiral as more consumers install solar panels on their roofs utilities will have to raise prices on their remaining customers to recover the lost revenues those higher rates will in turn drive more consumers to leave the utility system and so on but here is more good news the koch brothers are losing rather badly in kansas their home state a poll by north star opinion research reported that 91 percent of registered voters support solar and wind threequarters supported stronger policy encouragement of renewable energy even if such policies raised their electricity bills in georgia the atlanta tea party joined forces with the sierra club to form a new organization called – wait for it – the green tea coalition which promptly defeated a kochfunded scheme to tax rooftop solar panels meanwhile in arizona after the states largest utility an alec member asked the publicutility commission for a tax of up to 150 per month for solar households the opposition was fierce and wellorganized a compromise was worked out – those households would be charged just 5 per month – but barry goldwater jr the leader of a newly formed organization called tusk tell utilities solar wont be killed is fighting a new attempt to discourage rooftop solar in arizona characteristically the koch brothers and their allies have been using secretive and deceptive funding in arizona to run television advertisements attacking greedy owners of rooftop solar panels – but their effort has thus far backfired as local journalists have exposed the funding scam even though the kochfunded forces recently scored a partial and almost certainly temporary victory in ohio where the legislature voted to put a hold on the states renewableportfolio standard and study the issue for two years its clear that the attack on solar energy is too little too late last year the edison electric institute warned the utility industry that it had waited too long to respond to the sharp cost declines and growing popularity of solar at the point when utility investors become focused on these new risks and start to witness significant customer and earningserosion trends they will respond to these challenges but by then it may be too late to repair the utility business model the most seductive argument deployed by the koch brothers and their allies is that those who use rooftop solar electricity and benefit from the netmetering policies are free riders – that is they are allegedly not paying their share of the maintenance costs for the infrastructure of the old utility model including the grid itself this deceptive message especially when coupled with campaign contributions has persuaded some legislators to support the proposed new taxes on solar panels but the argument ignores two important realities facing the electric utilities first most of the excess solar electricity is supplied by owners of solar cells during peakload hours of the day when the grids capacity is most stressed – thereby alleviating the pressure to add expensive new coal or gasfired generating capacity but heres the rub what saves money for their customers cuts into the growth of their profits and depresses their stock prices as is often the case the real conflict is between the public interest and the special interest the second reality ignored by the koch brothers is the one they least like to discuss the one they spend so much money trying to obfuscate with their hired merchants of doubt you want to talk about the uncompensated use of infrastructure what about sewage infrastructure for 98 million tons per day of gaseous heattrapping waste that is daily released into our skies threatening the future of human civilization is it acceptable to use the thin shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet as an open sewer free of charge really t his after all is the reason the climate crisis has become an existential threat to the future of human civilization last april the average co2 concentrations in the earths atmosphere exceeded 400 partspermillion on a sustained basis for the first time in at least 800000 years and probably for the first time in at least 45 million years a period that was considerably warmer than at present according to a cautious analysis by the influential climate scientist james hansen the accumulated manmade globalwarming pollution already built up in the earths atmosphere now traps as much extra heat energy every day as would be released by the explosion of 400000 hiroshimaclass nuclear bombs its a big planet but thats a lot of energy and it is that heat energy that is giving the earth a fever denialists hate the fever metaphor but as the american association for the advancement of science aaas pointed out this year just as a 14­degreefever change would be seen as significant in a childs body a similar change in our earths temperature is also a concern for human society thirteen of the 14 hottest years ever measured with instruments have occurred in this century this is the 37th year in a row that has been hotter than the 20thcentury average april was the 350th month in a row hotter than the average in the preceding century the past decade was by far the warmest decade ever measured many scientists expect the coming year could break all of these records by a fair margin because of the extra boost from the anticipated el niño now gathering in the waters of the eastern pacific the effects of periodic el niño events are likely to become stronger because of global warming and this one is projected by many scientists to be stronger than average perhaps on the scale of the epic el niño of 1997 to 1998 the fastgrowing number of extremeweather events connected to the climate crisis has already had a powerful impact on public attitudes toward global warming a clear majority of americans now acknowledge that manmade pollution is responsible as the storms floods mudslides droughts fires and other catastrophes become ever more destructive the arcane discussions over how much of their extradestructive force should be attributed to global warming have become largely irrelevant the public at large feels it viscerally now as bob dylan sang you dont need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows besides there is a simple difference between linear cause and effect and systemic cause and effect as one of the worlds mostrespected atmospheric scientists kevin trenberth has said the environment in which all storms form has changed owing to human activities for example when supertyphoon haiyan crossed the pacific toward the philippines last fall the storm gained strength across seas that were 54 degrees fahrenheit warmer than they used to be because of greenhouse­gas pollution as a result haiyan went from being merely strong to being the most powerful and destructive oceanbased storm on record to make landfall four million people were displaced more than twice as many as by the indian ocean tsunami of 10 years ago and there are still more than 2 million haiyan refugees desperately trying to rebuild their lives when superstorm sandy traversed the areas of the atlantic ocean windward of new york and new jersey in 2012 the water temperature was nine degrees fahrenheit warmer than normal the extra convection energy in those waters fed the storm and made the winds stronger than they would otherwise have been moreover the sea level was higher than it used to be elevated by the melting of ice in the frozen regions of the earth and the expanded volume of warmer ocean waters five years earlier denialists accused me of demagogic exaggeration in an animated scene in my documentary an inconvenient truth that showed the waters of the atlantic ocean flooding into the 911 ground zero memorial site but in sandys wake the atlantic did in fact flood ground zero – many years before scientists had expected that to occur similarly the inundation of miami beach by rising sea levels has now begun and freshwater aquifers in lowlying areas from south florida to the nile delta to bangladesh to indochina are being invaded by saltwater pushed upward by rising oceans and of course many lowlying islands – not least in the bay of bengal – are in danger of disappearing altogether where will the climate refugees go similarly the continued melting of mountain glaciers and snowpacks is according to the best scientists already affecting water supplies for as many as a billion people around the world just as the extremeweather events we are now experiencing are exactly the kind that were predicted by scientists decades ago the scientific community is now projecting far worse extremeweather events in the years to come eighty percent of the warming in the past 150 years since the burning of carbonbased fuels gained momentum has occurred in the past few decades and it is worth noting that the previous scientific projections consistently lowballed the extent of the global­warming consequences that later took place – for a variety of reasons rooted in the culture of science that favor conservative estimates of future effects in an effort to avoid these cultural biases the aaas noted this year that not only are the impacts of the climate crisis very likely to become worse over the next 10 to 20 years and beyond but there is a possibility that temperatures will rise much higher and impacts will be much worse than expected moreover as global temperature rises the risk increases that one or more important parts of the earths climate system will experience changes that may be abrupt unpredictable and potentially irreversible causing large damages and high costs just weeks after that report there was shock and for some a temptation to despair when the startling news was released in may by scientists at both nasa and the university of washington that the longfeared collapse of a portion of the west antarctic ice sheet is not only under way but is also now irreversible even as some labored to understand what the word collapse implied about the suddenness with which this catastrophe will ultimately unfold it was the word irreversible that had a deeper impact on the collective psyche just as scientists 200 years ago could not comprehend the idea that species had once lived on earth and had subsequently become extinct and just as some people still find it hard to accept the fact that human beings have become a sufficiently powerful force of nature to reshape the ecological system of our planet many – including some who had long since accepted the truth about global warming – had difficulty coming to grips with the stark new reality that one of the longfeared tipping points had been crossed and that as a result no matter what we do sea levels will rise by at least an additional three feet the uncertainty about how long the process will take some of the best ice scientists warn that a rise of 10 feet in this century can not be ruled out did not change the irreversibility of the forces that we have set in motion but as eric rignot the lead author of the nasa study pointed out in the guardian its still imperative that we take action controlling climate warming may ultimately make a difference not only about how fast west antarctic ice will melt to sea but also whether other parts of antarctica will take their turn the news about the irreversible collapse in west antarctica caused some to almost forget that only two months earlier a similar startling announcement had been made about the greenland ice sheet scientists found that the northeastern part of greenland – long thought to be resistant to melting – has in fact been losing more than 10 billion tons of ice per year for the past decade making 100 percent of greenland unstable and likely as with west antarctica to contribute to significantly more sealevel rise than scientists had previously thought t he heating of the oceans not only melts the ice and makes hurricanes cyclones and typhoons more intense it also evaporates around 2 trillion gallons of additional water vapor into the skies above the us the warmer air holds more of this water vapor and carries it over the landmasses where it is funneled into landbased storms that are releasing record downpours all over the world for example an april shower came to pensacola florida this spring but it was a freak – another rainstorm on steroids two feet of rain in 26 hours it broke all the records in the region but as usual virtually no media outlets made the connection to global warming similar once in a thousand years storms have been occurring regularly in recent years all over the world including in my hometown of nashville in may 2010 alltime record flooding swamped large portions of england this winter submerging thousands of homes for more than six weeks massive downpours hit serbia and bosnia this spring causing flooding of biblical proportions a phrase now used so frequently in the western world that it has become almost a cliché and thousands of landslides torrential rains in afghanistan in april triggered mudslides that killed thousands of people – almost as many according to relief organizations as all of the afghans killed in the war there the previous year in march persistent rains triggered an unusually large mudslide in oso washington killing more than 40 people there are literally hundreds of other examples of extreme rainfall occurring in recent years in the americas europe asia africa and oceania in the planets drier regions the same extra heat trapped in the atmosphere by manmade globalwarming pollution has also been driving faster evaporation of soil moisture and causing recordbreaking droughts as of this writing 100 percent of california is in severe extreme or exceptional drought record fires are ravaging the desiccated landscape experts now project that an increase of one degree celsius over preindustrial temperatures will lead to as much as a 600­percent increase in the median area burned by forest fires in some areas of the american west – including large portions of colorado the national research council has reported that fire season is two and a half months longer than it was 30 years ago and in california firefighters are saying that the season is now effectively yearround drought has been intensifying in many other dry regions around the world this year brazil indonesia central and northwest africa and madagascar central and western europe the middle east up to the caspian sea and north of the black sea southeast asia northeast asia western australia and new zealand syria is one of the countries that has been in the bullseye of climate change from 2006 to 2010 a historic drought destroyed 60 percent of the countrys farms and 80 percent of its livestock – driving a million refugees from rural agricultural areas into cities already crowded with the million refugees who had taken shelter there from the iraq war as early as 2008 us state department cables quoted syrian government officials warning that the social and economic impacts of the drought are beyond our capacity as a country to deal with though the hellish and ongoing civil war in syria has multiple causes – including the perfidy of the assad government and the brutality on all sides – their climaterelated drought may have been the biggest underlying trigger for the horror the us military has taken notice of the strategic dangers inherent in the climate crisis last march a pentagon advisory committee described the climate crisis as a catalyst for conflict that may well cause failures of governance and societal collapse in the past the thinking was that climate change multiplied the significance of a situation said retired air force gen charles f wald now were saying its going to be a direct cause of instability pentagon spokesman mark wright told the press for dod this is a mission reality not a political debate the scientific forecast is for more arctic ice melt more sealevel rise more intense storms more flooding from storm surge and more drought and in yet another forecast difficult for congressional climate denialists to rebut climate experts advising the military have also warned that the worlds largest naval base in norfolk virginia is likely to be inundated by rising sea levels in the future and how did the republicandominated house of representatives respond to these grim warnings by passing legislation seeking to prohibit the department of defense from taking any action to prepare for the effects of climate disruption there are so many knockon consequences of the climate crisis that listing them can be depressing – diseases spreading crop yields declining more heat waves affecting vulnerable and elderly populations the disappearance of summerice cover in the arctic ocean the potential extinction of up to half of all the living species and so much more and that in itself is a growing problem too because when you add it all up its no wonder that many feel a new inclination to despair so clearly we will just have to gird ourselves for the difficult challenges ahead there is indeed literally light at the end of the tunnel but there is a tunnel and we are well into it i n november 1936 winston churchill stood before the united kingdoms house of commons and placed a period at the end of the misguided debate over the nature of the gathering storm on the other side of the english channel owing to past neglect in the face of the plainest warnings we have entered upon a period of danger the era of procrastination of half measures of soothing and baffling expedience of delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences we can not avoid this period we are in it now our civilization is confronting this existential challenge at a moment in our historical development when our dominant global ideology – democratic capitalism – has been failing us in important respects democracy is accepted in theory by more people than ever before as the best form of political organization but it has been hacked by large corporations defined as persons by the supreme court and special interests corrupting the political system with obscene amounts of money defined as speech by the same court capitalism for its part is accepted by more people than ever before as a superior form of economic organization but is – in its current form – failing to measure and include the categories of value that are most relevant to the solutions we need in order to respond to this threatening crisis clean air and water safe food a benign climate balance public goods like education and a greener infrastructure etc pressure for meaningful reform in democratic capitalism is beginning to build powerfully the progressive introduction of internetbased communication – social media blogs digital journalism – is laying the foundation for the renewal of individual participation in democracy and the reelevation of reason over wealth and power as the basis for collective decision­making and the growing levels of inequality worldwide combined with growing structural unemployment and more frequent market disruptions like the great recession are building support for reforms in capitalism both waves of reform are still at an early stage but once again churchills words inspire if youre going through hell keep going and that is why it is all the more important to fully appreciate the incredible opportunity for salvation that is now within our grasp as the satirical newspaper the onion recently noted in one of its trademark headlines scientists politely remind world that clean energy technology ready to go whenever we have the policy tools that can dramatically accelerate the transition to clean energy that market forces will eventually produce at a slower pace the most important has long since been identified we have to put a price on carbon in our markets and we need to eliminate the massive subsidies that fuel the profligate emissions of globalwarming pollution we need to establish green banks that provide access to capital investment necessary to develop renewable energy sustainable agriculture and forestry an electrified transportation fleet the retrofitting of buildings to reduce wasteful energy consumption and the full integration of sustainability in the design and architecture of cities and towns while the burning of fossil fuels is the largest cause of the climate crisis deforestation and factory farming also play an important role financial and technological approaches to addressing these challenges are emerging but we must continue to make progress in converting to sustainable forestry and agriculture in order to accomplish these policy shifts we must not only put a price on carbon in markets but also find a way to put a price on climate denial in our politics we already know the reforms that are needed – and the political will to enact them is a renewable resource yet the necessary renewal can only come from an awakened citizenry empowered by a sense of urgency and emboldened with the courage to reject despair and become active most importantly now is the time to support candidates who accept the reality of the climate crisis and are genuinely working hard to solve it – and to bluntly tell candidates who are not on board how much this issue matters to you if you are willing to summon the resolve to communicate that blunt message forcefully – with dignity and absolute sincerity – you will be amazed at the political power an individual can still wield in americas diminished democracy s omething else is also new this summer three years ago in these pages i criticized the seeming diffidence of president obama toward the great task of solving the climate crisis this summer it is abundantly evident that he has taken hold of the challenge with determination and seriousness of purpose he has empowered his environmental protection agency to enforce limits on co2 emissions for both new and as of this june existing sources of co2 he has enforced bold new standards for the fuel economy of the us transportation fleet he has signaled that he is likely to reject the absurdly reckless keystone xlpipeline proposal for the transport of oil from carbon­intensive tar sands to be taken to market through the united states on its way to china thus effectively limiting their exploitation and he is even now preparing to impose new limits on the release of methane pollution all of these welcome steps forward have to be seen of course in the context of obamas continued advocacy of a socalled alloftheabove energy policy – which is the prevailing code for aggressively pushing more drilling and fracking for oil and gas and to put the good news in perspective it is important to remember that us emissions – after declining for five years during the slow recovery from the great recession – actually increased by 24 percent in 2013 nevertheless the president is clearly changing his overall policy emphasis to make co2 reductions a much higher priority now and has made a series of inspiring speeches about the challenges posed by climate change and the exciting opportunities available as we solve it as a result obama will go to the united nations this fall and to paris at the end of 2015 with the credibility and moral authority that he lacked during the disastrous meeting in copenhagen four and a half years ago the international treaty process has been so fraught with seemingly intractable disagreements that some parties have all but given up on the possibility of ever reaching a meaningful treaty ultimately there must be one if we are to succeed and there are signs that a way forward may be opening up in may i attended a preparatory session in abu dhabi uae organized by united nations secretary general ban kimoon to bolster commitments from governments businesses and nongovernmental organizations ahead of this septembers un climate summit the twoday meeting was different from many of the others i have attended there were welcome changes in rhetoric and it was clear that the reality of the climate crisis is now weighing on almost every nation moreover there were encouraging reports from around the world that many of the policy changes necessary to solve the crisis are being adopted piecemeal by a growing number of regional state and city governments for these and other reasons i believe there is a realistic hope that momentum toward a global agreement will continue to build in september and carry through to the paris negotiations in late 2015 t he american poet wallace stevens once wrote after the final no there comes a yesand on that yes the future world depends there were many nos before the emergence of a global consensus to abolish chattel slavery before the consensus that women must have the right to vote before the fever of the nuclear­arms race was broken before the quickening global recognition of gay and lesbian equality and indeed before every forward advance toward social progress though a great many obstacles remain in the path of this essential agreement i am among the growing number of people who are allowing themselves to become more optimistic than ever that a bold and comprehensive pact may well emerge from the paris negotiations late next year which many regard as the last chance to avoid civilizational catastrophe while there is still time it will be essential for the united states and other major historical emitters to commit to strong action the us is finally now beginning to shift its stance and the european union has announced its commitment to achieve a 40percent reduction in co2 emissions by 2030 some individual european nations are acting even more aggressively including finlands pledge to reduce emissions 80 percent by 2050 it will also be crucial for the larger developing and emerging nations – particularly china and india – to play a strong leadership role fortunately there are encouraging signs chinas new president xi jinping has launched a pilot capandtrade system in two cities and five provinces as a model for a nationwide capandtrade program in the next few years he has banned all new coal burning in several cities and required the reporting of co2 emissions by all major industrial sources china and the us have jointly reached an important agreement to limit another potent source of globalwarming pollution – the chemical compounds known as hydrofluorocarbons or hfcs and the new prime minister of india as noted earlier has launched the worlds most ambitious plan to accelerate the transition to solar electricity underlying this new breaking of logjams in international politics there are momentous changes in the marketplace that are exercising enormous influence on the perceptions by political leaders of the new possibilities for historic breakthroughs more and more investors are diversifying their portfolios to include significant investments in renewables in june warren buffett announced he was ready to double berkshire hathaways existing 15 billion investment in wind and solar energy a growing number of large investors – including pension funds university endowments stanford announced its decision in may family offices and others – have announced decisions to divest themselves from carbon­intensive assets activist and impact investors are pushing for divestment from carbon­rich assets and new investments in renewable and sustainable assets several large banks and asset managers around the world full disclosure generation investment management which i cofounded with david blood and for which i serve as chairman is in this group have advised their clients of the danger that carbon assets will become stranded a stranded asset is one whose price is vulnerable to a sudden decline when markets belatedly recognize the truth about their underlying value – just as the infamous subprime mortgages suddenly lost their value in 2007 to 2008 once investors came to grips with the fact that the borrowers had absolutely no ability to pay off their mortgages shareholder activists and public campaigners have pressed carbondependent corporations to deal with these growing concerns but the biggest ones are still behaving as if they are in denial in may 2013 exxonmobil ceo rex tillerson responded to those pointing out the need to stop using the earths atmosphere as a sewer by asking what good is it to save the planet if humanity suffers i dont even know where to start in responding to that statement but here is a clue pope francis said in may if we destroy creation creation will destroy us never forget this e xxonmobil shell and many other holders of carbonintensive assets have argued in essence that they simply do not believe that elected national leaders around the world will ever reach an agreement to put a price on carbon pollution but a prospective global treaty however likely or unlikely you think that might be is only one of several routes to overturning the fossilfuel economy rapid technological advances in renewable energy are stranding carbon investments grassroots movements are building opposition to the holding of such assets and new legal restrictions on collateral flows of pollution – like particulate air pollution in china and mercury pollution in the us – are further reducing the value of coal tar sands and oil and gas assets in its series of reports to energy investors this spring citigroup questioned the feasibility of new coal plants not only in europe and north america but in china as well although there is clearly a political struggle under way in china between regional governments closely linked to carbon­energy generators suppliers and users and the central government in beijing – which is under growing pressure from citizens angry about pollution – the nations new leadership appears to be determined to engineer a transition toward renewable energy only time will tell how successful they will be the stock exchanges in johannesburg and são paulo have decided to require the full integration of sustainability from all listed companies standard poors announced this spring that some nations vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis may soon have their bonds downgraded because of the enhanced risk to holders of those assets a growing number of businesses around the world are implementing sustainability plans as more and more consumers demand a more responsible approach from businesses they patronize significantly many have been pleasantly surprised to find that adopting efficient lowcarbon approaches can lead to major cost savings and all the while the surprising and relentless ongoing decline in the cost of renewable energy and efficiency improvements are driving the transition to a lowcarbon economy is there enough time yes damage has been done and the period of consequences will continue for some time to come but there is still time to avoid the catastrophes that most threaten our future each of the trends described above – in technology business economics and politics – represents a break from the past taken together they add up to genuine and realistic hope that we are finally putting ourselves on a path to solve the climate crisis how long will it take when martin luther king jr was asked that question during some of the bleakest hours of the us civil rights revolution he responded how long not long because no lie can live forever how long not long because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice and so it is today how long not long this story is from the july 3rd17th 2014 issue of rolling stone from the archives issue 1212 july 3 2014",

            "body": "forum is extreme weather linked to global warming by yale environment 360 that global air and ocean temperatures are rising and that human activity is largely to blame is no longer a subject of debate among the vast majority of the worlds climate scientists but there is no such consensus when talk turns to another important question is climate change already causing more extreme weather events including worsening downpours and flooding intensifying heat waves and more powerful hurricanes asked eight leading climate experts whether they think there is growing evidence that humancaused global warming is contributing to an increased incidence of extreme weather — and to cite specific recent examples in their answers their responses varied with some contending that rising temperatures already are creating more tempestuous weather and others saying that more extreme weather may be likely but that not enough data yet exists to discern a trend in that direction scientists in both camps said two physical phenomena — warmer air holds more moisture and higher temperatures exacerbate naturally occurring heat waves — would almost by definition mean more extremes but some argued that the growing human toll from hurricanes tornadoes floods and heat waves is primarily related to burgeoning human population and the related degradation of the environment yes undoubtedly the environment in which all storms form has changed owing to human activities global warming has increased temperatures and directly related to that is an increase in the waterholding of the atmosphere over the ocean where there are no water limitations observations confirm that the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere has increased by about 4 percent consistent with a 1 degree f warming of sea surface temperatures since about the 1970s the human component does not change much from year to year and affects all storms in the absence of water during a drought the extra heat goes into raising temperatures and creating a more intense drought and heat waves no doubt contributing to the 2010 russian heat wave however the most spectacular events over the past year have been extreme heavy rains flooding in india china and pakistan in july and august and then queensland australia in december 2010 and january 2011 further very heavy rains in the us in april 2011 along with snow melt have also led to extensive flooding in all these cases very high sea surface temperatures have undoubtedly contributed to extra moisture flowing into the storms that produced the heavy rains and likely contributed to the strength of the storms through added energy while perhaps a major part of these high sea surface temperatures was related to natural variability such as enso el nino southern oscillation a component is related to global warming it is when global warming and natural variability come together that records are broken our current work is documenting the link between the asian flooding and the russian heat wave and why the blocking anticyclone that led to it was so persistent my answer to this question as posed is no however if you were to ask instead whether i expect that humancaused climate change will lead to more extreme weather events the answer would be yes humancaused climate change is something that will develop over decades to a century the time scale on which greenhouse gas concentrations are changing and evidence for or against it needs also to be considered over such lengths of time so if you are thinking about recent events such as hurricane katrina tornadoes in alabama or missouri flooding in bangladesh southeast asia or on the mississippi my answer is that a few such examples of extreme weather can not by definition be used as evidence for or against climate change only by longterm statistics can we demonstrate a change that might be attributable to climate therefore your request that we give an example or two of recent extreme weather events that you think either affirm or refute the contention that anthropogenic global warming is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme events makes no sense to me but having said that i do expect that global warming should lead to more extreme weather events extreme weather is powered by large fluxes of energy much of which comes from latent heat that is to say from condensation of water vapor since a warmer atmosphere will contain more water vapor i think it makes sense that we should expect more violent weather events in a warmer world this is a very general prediction however and certainly not one that any particular extreme event can prove or disprove overall im prepared to bet that its right but it will take another couple of decades of research and statistics to be sure the ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change defines climate change as a change in the statistics of weather occurring over 30 years or longer and persisting for decades thus the detection of a change in climate requires longterm records to suggest that particular extreme weather events are evidence of climate change is not just wrong but wrongheaded — every bit as much as the claims made during a particularly cold and snowy winter or even several in a row that such events somehow disprove climate change weather is not climate and shortterm climate variability is not climate change the detection of changes in climate requires looking at actual data — and the data on tornadoes largescale river floods in unaltered river basins and landfalling hurricanes shows no evidence of trends in the direction of more extreme events this should not be surprising because even if we assume a strong signal in extreme events from humancaused climate change the statistics suggest that it would take many decades and probably longer before such signals would be detected given this context claims that particular events can be attributed in a causal fashion to human emissions of greenhouse gases are simply unscientific if not fundamentally incoherent it is true that overall damage from tornadoes floods and hurricanes has been increasing in recent decades a recent literature review of extreme event impacts around the world found that everywhere that researchers have looked this increase can be entirely explained by increasing value of property at risk and increasing exposures to these hazards humancaused climate change is real and deserves effective policies in response the making of claims that are scientifically unsupportable will not further that effort there is some evidence that hydrological events are becoming more extreme this is not so easy to estimate because rainfall is often quite local so a good network of observing stations is required in the us where we have an excellent precipitation network several published papers present evidence that rainfall is becoming increasingly concentrated into less frequent but more intense events worldwide satellitebased observations indicate that the most intense tropical cyclones are becoming more frequent even though the far more plentiful weak storms are occurring somewhat less often in the north atlantic region where we have the best observations of such storms there is a close correlation between their power and the temperature of the tropical atlantic in summer this correlation which was first pointed out in 2005 has grown stronger since evidence is mounting that the tropical atlantic sea surface temperature has been influenced by sulfate aerosol global dimming as well as by greenhouse gas increases while evidence for a natural cycle in ocean temperature and storminess is correspondingly less persuasive although this has been an exceptional year for tornadoes in the us strong variations in reporting such events over time prevent us from deducing any longterm trends work is under way to examine trends in objective measures of thunderstorm rotation detected by doppler radar since about 1988 when such radars were first widely deployed but so far there has been little theoretical work on how global warming might influence severe local storms including tornadoes and hail storms the substantial interest in attributing extreme weather events to global warming seems rooted in the perceived need for some sort of a disaster to drive public opinion and the political process in the direction of taking action on climate change however attempts to attribute individual extreme weather events or collections of extreme weather events may be fundamentally illposed in the context of the complex climate system which is characterized by spatiotemporal chaos there are substantial difficulties and problems associated with attributing changes in the average climate to natural variability versus anthropogenic forcing which i have argued are oversimplified by the ipcc assessments attribution of extreme weather events is further complicated by their dependence on weather regimes and internal multidecadal oscillations that are simulated poorly by climate models i have been completely unconvinced by any of the arguments that i have seen that attributes a single extreme weather event a cluster of extreme weather events or statistics of extreme weather events to anthropogenic forcing improved analysis of the attribution of extreme weather events requires a substantially improved and longer database of the events interpretation of these events in connection with natural climate regimes such as el nino is needed to increase our understanding of the role of natural climate variability in determining their frequency and intensity improved methods of evaluating climate model simulations of distributions of extreme event intensity and frequency in the context of natural variability is needed before any confidence can be placed in inferences about the impact of anthropogenic influences on extreme weather events the ipcc has established that here is an increase in the frequency of some extreme weather types at the global level including heavy rainfall events and extreme temperatures part of these changes is also a result of increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations it is hard — if not impossible — to link individual local events to humancaused climate change still the likelihood of particular types of extreme events occurring may have shifted and socalled attribution studies can demonstrate this to a certain extent at the same time the occurrence of local weather extremes is influenced to a large extent by natural climatic variations that have a much more significant impact on timescales of tens of years even more important is that other processes determine the impact of extreme weather events — principally the way humans modify their environment and often settle in locations where natural hazards occur these are therefore the only reason that we have been seeing more frequent and widespread weather disaster over the past decades for example severe flooding has occurred in pakistan before but its growing population made the impacts of last years flooding much worse the 2005 flooding disaster in new orleans could only occur because the population was not well protected against the surge that the winds of hurricane katrina caused at the moment there is no record of weatherrelated disasters in the scientific literature that can be demonstrated to have been caused by humanmade climate change causes in the near future we will see more disasters in places where growing populations are not well protected from the weather — but not because of climate change that is happening today and tomorrow not all extreme events are expected to increase or even change for example there is quite a bit of evidence that greenhouse gas increases have contributed to recent widespread changes in the frequency of extreme temperatures but this encompasses both decreases in the number of cold days and nights and increases in the number of warm nights the widespread recent warming which for global and continental mean data has been found to be likely due largely to human influences leads to a changing probability of extreme temperatures however there are also cases where the tail of the temperature distribution is changing differently from the mean warming can lead to more severe drought in regions and seasons where precipitation decreases or remains largely unchanged while evaporation increases due to warmer temperatures furthermore the warming atmosphere has been shown to become moister this probably explains the statistically significant shift towards more extreme precipitation events worldwide which can not be explained by climate variability and is best explained by human influences individual weather extremes can generally neither confirm nor dispute the role of humans in climate change the only meaningful approach is to estimate changes in the probability of events of the kind observed and then see if human influence has changed this probability for example there is a very convincing study that shows that the probability of a heat wave of the magnitude of the 2003 european heat wave has very likely substantially increased due to global warming recently another similar study showed that the fall 2000 floods in the uk were more likely in a warming world than they would have been without human influence on climate we live on a planet that does much if not most of its business through extreme events what we call climate reflects the summingup of these extremes to find averages and what we call climate variability or change will therefore be reflected in variability or change in the locations timing patterns intensity and duration of these extremes that said the statistics of the extremes are inherently noisy teasing out longterm changes in the relationships linking the extremes and the averages merits concerted and sustained scientific attention but will remain a multiyear aspiration scientists — let alone nonexperts — will be debating any findings for some time to come the most likely place to be convincing earliest may prove to be the statistics for heat waves and cold snaps in the meantime society has to deal with extremes the truth is that were not proving very adept at coping with the extremes and hazards were facing today furthermore the biggest change in our experience with hazards in coming decades is most likely going to prove to be the result of social change and technology advance population growth urbanization and movements to hazardprone areas such as coasts dependence on critical infrastructure the tendency toward zeromargin societies in both the developed and developing world and so on landuse and building codes noadverseimpact policies for levees and other hazard measures learning from experience and publicprivate collaborations for building community resilience are going to be urgently needed in parallel with the natural science comments the post very interesting and it seems that most of the scientists believe there is some impact of climate change even if its just to make an event that wouldve happened anyway worse i think a lot of them are just saying we need more data over a longer period of time to say yes or no but really it starts sometime and it starts being noticeable at some point yeah the data 30 years from now will prove it either way but we have to live it now posted by krista on 02 jun 2011 stunningly absent is any mention of stalled persistent stationary or stagnant weather systemspatterns that are already resulting as a consequence of global warming moreover the jet stream instead of flowing predominantly west to east as usual meanders more north and south probably due to deicing of the arctic ocean posted by stanley scharf on 02 jun 2011 we have heard for a long time that it is not possible to attribute any single climate event to humaninduced warming quite so but how many times can that claim be made if we experience a couple of heat waves a drought some floods and several extreme hurricanes over couple of years the claim that each can not be attributable to humaninduced warming starts to look like the inverse of the gamblers delusion nine straight tails from tossing a coin increases the chances that the next toss will produce a head posted by clive hamilton on 02 jun 2011 how can anyone take mr trenberth seriously when he refers to global warming without any quantifiable qualification of the term and gives a 100 yes with no supporting evidence he also gets rather mixed up by talking about increased temperatures causing droughts then excessive rains and floods again without any qualification or reference also what snow melts what very high sea surface temperatures these again sound like alarmist scaremongering especially when the term likely is used which generally means i cant prove it from what ive seen and as has been referenced by the other writers is the main human influence that we see is an increased population exposed to weather events and not protected had the levees in new orleans been high and strong enough there would have been no human disaster we also have very short term memories about as long as political election cycles if we look back the australian floods were quite predictable as there is a history of them this raises the fundamental question what are we measuring here climate event severity or the human cost of said events you can not mix these two and get any rational answer one notable ting ive noticed in the uk when reporters report floods is that they often refer to the location as a flood plain then totally disconnected from that say what a disaster it is if only we could connect the two halves the answer lies before us if we build in flood plains without adequate defences as is normal were going to get flooded and there will be a large human cost lives and property value the natural variabilityforcings have also been given far less weight than they should have for example the suns activity level and wobble cycles are now being recognised as being far more significant than has previously been given credit so making any possible human influence much smaller what noone has mentioned though is the fact that more of these events are now reported than used to be far sooner and also now with a lower threshold of severity this is called statistics and can be made to demonstrate anything wheres the objectivity so sorry mr trenberth your rather feeble so selfassured but fictitious assertions just dont wash with the quickly increasing majority who just dont accept the agw lies any more how about we go away observationally measure everything not models at a higher resolution in all dimensions across the globe land and sea valleys mountains and sky north and south east and west for 100 years then come back and ask the question again final observation no physicists invited to answer the question posted by scs on 02 jun 2011 hard to let last comment go unchallenged climate models and too bad scs engaged in an ad joni en attack on dr trenberth without giving his own name the predictions of climate change do predict both droughts in some areas as the temperature rises and wind patterns change as well as increased rainfall in other areas leading to more floods as warmer air can hold more water there is no contradiction there scs then disputes measured surface sea temperatures and measured ice volumes without giving any supportive data he says that solar radiance and the earths wobble can account for the changes we are seeing in the climate at least therefore he must believe they there are changes posted by nick snow on 02 jun 2011 the question was whether climate change is contributing to extreme weather events and some of them turned it around saying that extreme weather events dont prove climate change which wasnt what they were asked extreme weather events dont prove climate change but many other lines of evidence do given that evidence and people like curry and pielke accept that it is reasonable to think that it contributes to some types of extreme weather and there is evidence for that trenberth was spot on when he said that climate change combined with natural variability is what is causing some of these extreme events particularly floods posted by dean myerson on 02 jun 2011 this disregard for risk fundamentals in this debate undermines its credibility and service frequency of events aside the differential vulnerability of urbanized and coastal societies is not academic and cant wait for multidecadal oscillation data sets actuarial statisticians reinsurance companies and financial institutions are quickly working with realtime data and intuitive models that are drawing circles around risks and driving coverage and pricing climate science needs to come off the mountain forget about the ipcc and bring human risk back to the table posted by dave g on 02 jun 2011 insurance companies have raised rates to meet higher loss rates from severe thunderstorms over the past 3 years despite the lack of economic growth and recent building activity something has happened with weather patterns that is contributing to increasingly damaging events a quick review of the climate data centers web site shows that the mississippi valley has increasing amounts of precipitation over the past 30 years a quick review of atlantic ocean sea surface temperatures shows that the western atlantic and gulf of mexico have warmed to record or near record temperatures since 1980 so while by definition weather is not climate there is strong evidence supporting dr trenberths position that extreme precipitation events and severe thunderstorms are more frequent and that heat stored in the oceans underlies the increase in extreme events the deniers position that solar activity is causing warming is absurd given that the sun went through the longest and quietest solar minimum in 100 years the reduction in solar luminosity should have caused a slight cooling solar luminosity has declined slightly over the past 30 years dr roger pielke is not a climate scientist he should not be treated as one by this blog in my opinion note that dr kerry emanuel is politically conservative also he does not depend on climate science funding for his research hes an expert on the physics of atmospheric convection he literally wrote the book on the physics of tropical storms he has no political or economic dog in this fight his opinion is based on sound science not politics posted by fishoutofwater on 02 jun 2011 dr kevin trenberth is a climate scientist and thinks that the 2011 floods in qld australia are something out of the ordinary maybe he should study some weather history before he opens his mouth floods of the severity that recently hit brisbane these were not as severe as some previous floods occur every few decades last major flood was in 1973 for the brisbane basin severe floods have actually decreased in regularity and severity compared to the late 1800s there were 5 major floods in the 15yrs between 1885 and 1900 here is a link from the australian bureau of meteorology httpwwwbomgovauhydrofloodqldfldhistorybrisbanehistoryshtml its such lack of historical knowledge and incorrect information by leaders in the climate science field that erode confidence in their opinions posted by brett on 02 jun 2011 i think scs is spot on with his comment we all need to look at the historical record say for the last 200 years to put things in perspective so as to avoid any kneejerk reactions to the weather events of the last few months and attempts to link them to climate our modern communications networks tv internet etc allow for much more coverage of these events and distorted perceptions of frequency kudos to the above writers who mostly showed restraint in blaming any one weather event on climate posted by hank on 02 jun 2011 unfortunately dr trenberth left the field of science several years ago to pursue a career in sales all of us continue to wait for the missing heat to be located but that has not prevented dr trenberth from assuring us that it is out there somewhere and that — notwithstanding the missing evidence— the hypothesis of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming is as solid as a mortgagebacked security posted by john garrett on 03 jun 2011 just one point regarding the impossibility of demonstrating a correlationat this time taken as a whole world weather is a closed system and is governed by wellknown physical laws if the total heat energy present is increasing then on average local energy thresholds for extreme weather events must logically be reached more frequently perhaps its not much perhaps patterns are changing and therefore difficult to recognize but some effects should be apparent posted by james on 03 jun 2011 the comments are interesting such as higher temperatures world wide means more evaporation from the seas and more precip ill go with the majority for a 30 year gathering of data and waite to see for the findings then im 92 years old posted by george d whiyney on 03 jun 2011 the oceans are heating up httpwwwskepticalsciencecomhowweknowglobalwarmingishappeningpart2html there is no missing heat the personal attacks on trenberth are standard right wing political hits please stick to the science a careful review of australian flood and la nina data not only shows a correlation between la nina and australian floods it also shows a correlation with mississippi river floods the spring following january australian floods the past year there have been many floods on many continents all correlated with la nina however close inspection of noaa identified ocean heat anomalies shows that the floods also correlate with areas of exceptionally high heat content strong la nina winds have carried large amounts of water vapor evaporated from areas of high heat content towards adjacent land areas causing massive flooding from south america to south asia trenberth is correct natural variability and natural cycles combine with the increasing precipitable water due to anthropogenic climate change to produce years like this with exceptional numbers of extreme weather events posted by fishoutofwater on 03 jun 2011 scs et al trenberths assessment is systemsbased its theoretical its backed by our understanding of the climate system and its changing variables his position is scientifically tenable with current empirical data his position is probably a good starting point if we dump more energy into a system what do we expect of course the system is complex its unlikely everything will become more extreme recent research has indicated a decrease in extreme wind and overall atmospheric circulation other research as emanuel noted indicates that less powerful hurricanes are becoming less frequent but these observations should give us some confidence in our systemsbased assessments they were predicted by models its completely true that we generally cant attribute specific events to anthropogenic warming though there have been numerous attempts published in highimpact journals but that doesnt mean we cant use our understanding of the system our empirical data to attribute global weather trends to global temperature trends sure the attribution has error bars but we have a pretty good idea of how the system should respond at least in a hazy general sense and we have a pretty good understanding of how the system has changed over the past couple decades at least again in a hazy general sense we expect the hydrological cycle to intensify we expect this due to our systemsbased understanding of the climate climate model output and our understanding of paleoprecipitation and paleoclimate so far data seem to indicate this is happening we expect drought in some places to become more severe we expect this to our systemsbased understanding of the climate and climate model output which both indicate an expansion of the hadley cell so far data seem to indicate hadley cell expansion and expected weather impacts we expect heat waves to become more severe and frequent at least if defined against previous means we expect this due to our systemsbased understand of the climate and our model output so far data indicate that record temperatures are becoming more frequent we expect an increase in the frequency of the most severe hurricanes we expect this due to our systemsbased understanding of hurricane formation which is certainly imperfect so far data indicate the most severe hurricanes are becoming more frequent we are just starting to learn how to assess how hurricanes may have responded to paleoclimate these basic predictions are based on a systemsunderstanding of our climate they are so far scientifically tenable empirical data indicate they are accurate predictions but we dont have a great deal of data so its perfectly reasonable to remind ourselves that we arent yet in a position to distinguish anthropogenic influence from natural variation from a risk management standpoint however we should be more concerned that we may already see correlations with so little warming if even one of these trends continues with further warming consequences could be greater than anticipated especially if emissions continue unabated for those who fear historical perspective isnt being taken into account when assessing recent weather for potential trends read the actual scientific literature research treats the subject very conservatively data are tested for statistical significance careful thought and controls are used to mitigate bias conclusions are understated and unknowns are always front and center many seem to think this is a political issue its not its scientific and the proof is in the science its in the journals its in the conferences and yes roger pielke is not a climate scientist notice he also indicates that data do not indicate an increase in the frequency of the most extreme hurricanes emanuel is a hurricaneclimate expert he may be considered the hurricaneclimate expert emanuel indicates the most extreme hurricanes are becoming more frequent he can explain why and hes demonstrated it in the scientific literature its one thing to argue that recent trends reflect natural variability and that emanuels theoretical understanding of hurricanes is inaccurate but suggesting the trend doesnt exist is just wrong pielke is overstating his position weather is created in climate were altering climate were increasing climatic energy its not that great a stretch to anticipate increases in extreme events we may not yet know the details but we know our fingerprint is now in the climate so we know its in weather and thats trenberths point and its a fair point the real questions are how big is our fingerprint how much larger will it become and how will it influence future weather posted by anthony no on 03 jun 2011 to me the exact obverse seems to be true extreme weather events are more likely to be linked to global cooling which is currently just beginning its progress northwestern usa temperatures have been low this year with massive snowfalls etc these lower temperatures and warmer air form the gulf of mexico generate increased differentials and thus give rise to the more extreme weather events that we have seen recently as global cooling proceeds the differential poles to the equator grows and one can expect more weather extremes not less a warmer climate is likely to be more benign and a colder climate is truly deadly from httpjudithcurrycom20110526thefutilityofcarbonreductionmore3330 brian h june 1 2011 at 622 am at a rough guess the odds of warming being benign are about 80 and of cooling being benign about 001 the odds of warming occurring are about 10 and of cooling occurring about 60 the ratio of the riskiness is thus 181619999 0200006 333 so it makes 333x more sense to prepare for cooling disaster than for warming posted by edmh on 04 jun 2011 i rather hurriedly skimmed through the 8 assessments so i may be mistkaen but in my oinion all of these experts plus the people who formulated the question seem to have missed some basic considerations first humanity is engaged in multiple major modifications of the biosphere only one of which and likely not the most significant is global warming the appropriate question is theefore not whether extreme conditions are increased by global warming but whether they are increased by human intervention much of which also causes global warming so there may be correlations that are not causeandeffect but the result of there being related or identical human causes for global warming and extreme events second i have long viewed ecosystems as being if not precisely then very similar to laplace transforms of the past history of energy and other resource inputs another wayof saying approximately the same ting is to obsrve that each species has a characteristic time constant describing the rapidity with which it adapts its total biomass to varying conditions it will tend to take advantage of comparable time constants in the change of inputs related to the seasons longerterm solar events etc one sort of generalized niche inan ecosystem in which a species takes advantage of a gradient in space or time of some measure like temperature elevation etc extracting energy by lessening the gradient in accordance with the second law of thermosynamics which is to say that an inherent characteistic of an ecosystem is that it feeds off variations in conditions by extracting energy by deceasing those variations so it is inherent in biodiversity and the existence of a mature ecosystem that it will stabilize local conditions of temperature wate supply you name it so without having to know etails we can be certain that decreasing biodiversity is going to increase extreme conditions i am virtally certain that the concept can be made quantitative because it is to large degree the purpose of ecosystems and biopdivesity to moderate extremes and by doing so extrct energy for the survival of the species constituting the ecosystem forests are obvious cases in point since they moderate changes in temperature and water supply posted by nicholas arguimbau on 04 jun 2011 the more the ipcc promotes the global warming hysteria the more irrelevant it becomes to suggest that agw is rampant is just basically a well proven lie too many studies clearly demonstrates that to be a fact but it shpuld not stop global warming supporters from standing back and taking another good look at what must be circumstantial evidence rather than fact too much needs to be learned before anyone can claim that the weather is involved in climate change and vice a versa meanwhile we wait for the hysterics to die down and wait for some more facts rather fiction which scientists appear to want to expose without political intervention the public is still waiting posted by christian j on 04 jun 2011 those commentators who presume to know more than dr trenberth and who are disparaging him for his comments made above might offer a more reasoned and scientific opinion had they actually read his many scientific papers and the scientific literature which support his statements we have altered the earths climate system by in very short time increasing co2 levels to their highest levels in 800 000 years possibly even millions of years it is naive and myopic to assume that doing so will have had and will continue to have no significant ramifications there is in fact abundant evidence in the literature to support trenberths statements as dr emanuel noted there is quite a bit of evidence suggesting that heavy and extreme rainfall events are on the increase including droughts there is also evidence that the hydrological cycle may be accelerating and that the frequency of heat waves is increasing the much more worrisome events though include the worldwide loss of terrestrial land ice and the dramatic loss of arctic sea ice an extreme event in its own right seemingly omniscient readers here ridiculing dr trenberth might wish to show some respect and address the science and substantiate their misguided assertions with some facts rather than making ad hominem attacks posted by albatross on 04 jun 2011 the extreme rainfall events which recently afflicted australia came at the end of a national drought which at the time was said by our csiro to represent a new dry reality which we would have to become attuned to theyve since updated their position to uncertain but more rain and drought likely depending on where you live our just released climate commission report has attributed increased bush fire damage to climate change though they preferenced a nonnormalized study over those which did normalize for urbanisation the latter dont find a connection with regard to this topic i have no doubt that some authorities are simply seeing what they want to see posted by david anderson on 05 jun 2011 brett on 02 jun 2011 says for the brisbane basin severe floods httpwwwbomgovauhydrofloodqldfldhistorybrisbanehistoryshtml its such lack of historical knowledge and incorrect information by leaders in the climate science field that erode confidence in their opinions b dont know what youre trying to prove with that it means nothing without including consideration of the flood control structures that have been getting erected during those years also lets not forget trenberth isnt only looking at brisbane floods he was looking at the whole atmospheric event and others selectivity of data helps no one jg the missing heat has been found in the deep ocean the earth observation data is out there just need to be willing to face it heres a start on that missing heat story httpwwwskepticalsciencecomdeepoceanwarminghtml great point james one worth repeating taken as a whole world weather is a closed system and is governed by wellknown physical laws if the total heat energy present is increasing then on average local energy thresholds for extreme weather events must logically be reached more frequently and as my above post links to the evidence of these actual physical changes is out there posted by citizenschallenge on 05 jun 2011 interesting responses both by the experts and those who posted comments thank you all for your thoughts on the matter one thing i found unclear in dr currys response how are we to get the data for natural vs humaninfluenced variability if we are using the data from our own times we must hypothesize a baseline level of human influence as it would be a needed assumption in the discussion if we are using data from recent times as far back as the start of the industrial revolution the assumption of some degree of human influence would still be needed i have seen several pieces regarding differences in human influences over time based on differences in the optical properties and concentrations of our industrial outputs some aerosols seem to reflect a lot of insolation for instance if we assume that nearly all of our direct data from current and historical sources is tainted by human influences on the system the urban heat island effect is a favorite among many arguing against the validity of the science then we must go back to times before human influence had much chance of being measurable and we must rely on proxy data sources which are often disputed in the public discourse does anybody have any ideas on how to separate the signal from natural cycles from the signals from human influences including any disruptions to existing natural feedback loops there were three separate attacks on dr trenberths response in the comments so far scs seems to make a number of unwarranted assumptions insisting on definitions for global warming a worldwide longterm increase in average temperature and likely established in ipcc reports as a confidence of 90 or greater scs wants numbers and citations in this nonpeerreviewed venue an inappropriate demand then denies that statistics can be used with enough reliability to be trusted dr trenberths response to the question posed is clear enough even if he generalizes for this audience he has given wellsupported numbers in other writings and should not be expected to do the same here in limited space the second attack on dr trenberth by brett is over the floods in queensland i for one expect to find gaps in the knowledge of any expert we are all human the best of us are always learning new things even after a long life spent in diligent effort gaps will remain the third attack on dr trenberth by john garrett is simply wrong the socalled missing heat has been known to be in the oceans and heat of fusion for melting ice for over a decade complete with accurate measurements and reproduction of results if mr garrett and all of us are not aware of this they need to read more on the subject finally the question of whether risks from human population distributions are what we are really seeing in the recent data is a red herring certainly this tends to dominate coverage in the popular press certainly this tends to dominate the actuarial processes these tragedies may impact our views but professional scientists work hard to keep such biases out of their work human risk is not the question here localized extremes and longterm trends are posted by daniel gilsdorf on 05 jun 2011 both sides have arguments based on the measured evidence but trenberths basic approach to the question is different from everyone elses everyone else is arguing from the measured statistics of extremeweather events they are saying that the statistics are not good enough and will not be good enough for quite a while to come to a statistically valid statement on the question trenberth is arguing from measured modifications in the factors that cause extreme weather he is saying that we can see increases in the factors that must naturally lead to extremeweather events the point is that trenberth has enough faith in his understanding of how the climate works that he believes he can see the causeeffect inprogress whereas the others are saying they need to see a statistically valid trend established for more time under the circumstances it will take a longer time for consensus to arise on this particular point probably on the order of a decade or more if we look back in 20 years and find that it has been a period of extremeweather events we will say that trenberth was a visionary who dared to say that he saw the signal amidst the noise if instead we find that the period has not been particularly extreme we will say that trenberth was overinterpreting the data posted by neal j king on 05 jun 2011 excellent post yes there is definite evidence that weather extremes and global warming and climate change are related drajagadeesh nelloreapindia posted by drajagadeesh on 05 jun 2011 my immediate reaction after reading the statements of the experts while nero fiddles rome burns trenberth is the only expert who seems to grasp the urgency of now posted by john hartz on 05 jun 2011 were scientists who specialize in attribution contacted for this forum for example zwiers stott and santer instead we have people like curry glibly dismissing the body of science on attribution and extreme precipitation events around the globe munich re and other insurance groups have documented a rapid increase in damages from meteorological events far more so than for other natural disasters like earthquakes and volcanoes httpwwwmunichrecomenmediarelationscompanynews201020101108companynewsaspx

experts with celebrity contrarians pielke is not a climate scientist and is notoriously unreliable and frequently wrong curry has been excoriated for her antiscience ranting and is now more accurately described as a political blogger than climate scientist its clearly not a coincidence these two were picked from thousands of possible experts someone knew they could be relied on to spice up the story with contrarian views this is just more of the neverending false balance from a media that is more concerned with drawing traffic than informing the public with good science posted by bluerock on 07 jun 2011 if clive douglas wants to be taken seriously he should stop running away from physics increasing the heat content flux and contrast of any heat engine an atmosphere in dynamic equilibrium with a hydrosphere included will tend to accelerate the motion of its working fluid and accelerated fluid motion and heat flux conduces to higher rates of evaporation so when he dislikes the weather he sees he would do his predictable line of argument better service by reflecting on the magnitude of its anthropogenic component instead of denying its existence thermodynamics doesnt need an invitation to anybodys tea party posted by russell seitz on 07 jun 2011 i see this over and over again journalists keep forwarding the same wrong question from the public which perpetuates the public misunderstanding around climate change as it relates to these blipintime phenomena like hurricane katrina its clear that the scientists understand this and are trying to work around that but the journalists and the public dont quite get it as suggested by professor pielke regardless of whether hes right or peerreviewed or whatever the lay person doesnt understand the nuance here which is why the wrong question keeps getting repeated scientists should not be trying to answer the question as asked but rather they should be reeducating the public by redirecting the question into one that can actually be answered by the data well unfortunately youre asking the wrong question because climate is measured over much longer time scales so it may be another decade or so before we know if these extreme events like katrina were tied to global climate change as a science communicator i know that the public wants a more useful answer than thatsomething to help them make policy decisions perhaps what good is the science to them if it cant advise the decisionmaking process i would be disappointed if i didnt have some kind of practical followup answer like but many of the current models do predict an increase in extreme weather events associated with climate change and if we continue to see more of these events the evidence for our models becomes stronger scientists prefer not to speculate but if the models are consistent we probably will look back 10 years from now and say with more certainty that yes in fact these events were tied to global warming or global climate change posted by stevon on 09 jun 2011 why do you put forward discredited denialists like pielke and curry into this debate they have been shown to present biased and distorted views and simply muddy the waters posted by ia on 25 jul 2011 extreme weather is linked to global warming on steroids posted by stanley scharf on 11 nov 2011 first pielke and curry are pseudoscientists and bloggers they offer opinions second scientific consensus is reached by a preponderance of evidence at a given time obeying known physical chemical and biological laws that can be reproduced the results are published in peerreviewed journals hypotheses are accepted and rejected over time if we knew everything now our understanding would be complete and research would end third we live in a stochastic world constrained by boundaries not a deterministic one in which are actions are linearly connected this leads to various levels of uncertainty and models need to be reinitialized periodically human nature favors certainty whether in the behavior of markets or the natural world expressions of uncertainty leads to fear disbelief and superstition they also are amplified by the media unfortunately simple statistical theory and probability are not taught in most educational systems fourth obervations and data from the past that are leading to what we call global climate change do not disobey and known natural laws and in many cases are predicted by them exponential increases in phenomena are characterized by a long initial period in which the multiplying can hardly be discerned thus an unusual or unprecedented rate of increase in a property requires attention this seems to be the case for increasing global atmospheric temperature finally some factoids noaa oceanographers in the 1960s predicted increasing frequency and severity of weather events without benefit of models melting of permafrost is releasing methane a major greenhouse gas from rotting previously frozen vegetation a large percentage of atmospheric co2 is entering the ocean causing acidification which is affecting shellfish zooplankton and corals had this co2 stayed in the atmosphere its heat content would have

starting irreversible collapse nasa nasa has just hosted a conference on the state of the west antarctic ice sheet which it could be said provoked something of a reaction this is what a holy shit moment for global warming looks like ran a headline in mother jones magazine we announced that we had collected enough observations to conclude that the retreat of ice in the amundsen sea sector of west antarctica was unstoppable with major consequences – it will mean that sea levels will rise one metre worldwide whats more its disappearance will likely trigger the collapse of the rest of the west antarctic ice sheet which comes with a sea level rise of between three and five metres such an event will displace millions of people worldwide two centuries – if that is what it takes – may seem like a long time but there is no red button to stop this process reversing the climate system to what it was in the 1970s seems unlikely we can barely get a grip on emissions that have tripled since the kyoto protocol which was designed to hit reduction targets slowing down climate warming remains a good idea however – the antarctic system will at least take longer to get to this point the amundsen sea sector is almost as big as france six glaciers drain it the two largest ones are pine island glacier 30km wide and thwaites glacier 100km wide they stretch over 500km many impressive scientists have gone before us in this territory the concept of west antarctic instability goes back to the 1970s following surveys by charles bentley in the 1960s that revealed an ice sheet resting on a bed grounded well below sea level and deepening inland hans weertman had shown in 1974 that a marinebased ice sheet resting on a retrograde bed was unstable robert thomas extended his work to pursue the instability hypothesis terry hughes suggested that the pine island sector of west antarctica was its weak underbelly and that its retreat would collapse the west antarctic ice sheet considerable uncertainty remained about the timescale however due to a lack of observation of this very remote area things changed with the launch of the ers1 satellite which allowed glaciers in this part of antartica to be observed from space in 1997 i found that the grounding line where the glacier detaches from its bed and becomes afloat of pine island glacier had retreated five kilometres in the space of four years between 1992 and 1996 stan jacobs and adrian jenkins had found a year earlier that the glacier was bathing in unusually warm waters which suggested the ocean had a major influence on the glacier duncan wingham and others showed that the glacier was thinning in 2001 i found that thwaites glacier was retreating too at that point the scientific community took a different look at the region work by the british antarctic survey nasa and chile led to more detailed observations a monitoring programme was initiated instruments were placed on the ice in the ocean and scientific results started to pile up from a variety of research programmes from that point we all sought to find out whether this was really happening now two decades after this process started we have witnessed glacier grounding lines retreat by kilometres every year glaciers thinning by metres every year hundreds of kilometres inland losing billions of tons of water annually and speeding up several percent every year to the flanks of topographic divides thwaites glacier started to accelerate after 2006 and in 2011 we detected a huge retreat of the glacier grounding lines since 2000 detailed reconstructions of the glacier bed further confirmed that no mountain or hill in the back of these glaciers could act as a barrier and hold them up and 40 years of glacier flow evolution showed that the speedup was a long story all these results indicate a progressive collapse of this area at the current rate a large fraction of the basin will be gone in 200 years but recent modelling studies indicate that the retreat rate will increase in the future how did this happen a clue is that all the glaciers reacted at the same time which suggested a common force that can only be the ocean ocean heat is pushed by the westerly winds and the westerlies have changed around antarctica in response to climate warming and the depletion of the ozone the stronger winds are caused by a world warming faster than a cooling antarctica stronger westerlies push more subsurface warm waters poleward to melt the glaciers and push surface waters northward nerilie abram and others have just confirmed that the westerlies are stronger now than at any other time in the past 1000 years and their strengthening has been particularly prominent since the 1970s as a result of humaninduced climate warming model predictions also show that the trend will continue in a warming climate what this means is that we may be ultimately responsible for triggering the fast retreat of west antarctica this part of the continent was likely to retreat anyway but we probably pushed it there faster it remains difficult to put a timescale on it because the computer models are not good enough yet but it could be within a couple of centuries as i noted there is also a bigger picture than west antarctica the amundsen sea sector is not the only vulnerable part of the continent east antarctica includes marinebased sectors that hold more ice one of them totten glacier holds the equivalent of seven metres of global sea level controlling climate warming may ultimately make a difference not only about how fast west antarctic ice will melt to sea but also whether other parts of antarctica will take their turn several candidates are lined up and we seem to have figured a way to push them out of equilibrium even before warming of air temperature is strong enough to melt snow and ice at the surface unabated climate warming of several degrees over the next century is likely to speed up the collapse of west antarctica but it could also trigger irreversible retreat of marinebased sectors of east antarctica whether we should do something about it is simply a matter of common sense and the time to act is now antarctica is not waiting for us ◊ eric rignot a leading glaciologist at nasa is the senior author of the new landmark scientific paper on west antartica publ here 1852014",

to past neglect in the face of the plainest warnings we have now entered upon a period of danger the era of procrastination of halfmeasures of delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences we can not avoid this period we are in it now winston churchill 12 november 1936 testimony to the house of commons debate on national defense posture this is not yet widely known it is simply too late for business government and the world to fix the y2k bug any where near completion we are now well past the point of no return dont expect to hear this from the government or corporate public relations personell it is their job to prevent panic sweating nailbiting and resigning chief information officers will continue to send optimistic sounding reports and stories to the media indicating they are on it much genuine good news will also be heard but will be the exceptionnot the rule in fact many dont even care and vastly underestimated the consequences of y2k many are just waiting and hoping for a quickfix silver bullet that will never arrive a july 1998 sec filing found that an astonishing 73 percent of us firms had not begun their actual code remediation according to a july 1998 analysis of federal securities filings nearly 60 of the nations 250 largest corporations still have not even completed their year 2000 assessments 5 to 10 of a y2k project recent may 1999 data by weiss found the following progress of the largest 500 companies y2k rating number of companies high 51 average 220 below average 208 low 59 insufficient data 279 overall the 538 nonfinancial companies rated by weiss have budgeted 26 billion for y2krelated preparations but have spent only 136 billion barely half of the funds allocated 75 percent of small businesses have not even addressed y2k confirmed by another study and 50 plan to do nothing a full 83 are vulnerable among britians largest companies which give the everythings aok 90 are on track mantra that is rampant among misleadingly optimistic reports 20 have not yet taken a full inventory of the problem and a further 45 have not completed their millennium bug strategy bbc in another june 1999 report almost a third of the uks top 1000 companies will not have completed their y2k programs by the years end and 19 per cent had not completed the first stage of inventory preparation worldwide 75 of countries have done nothing on y2k experts agree that any organization that hasnt started a full y2k effort as of late 1997 has little chance of success anyone starting by may 1998 can at best hope to fix 60 of their systems this is a global phenomenon because of the huge investment required managers procrastinated and ignored it as a trivial matter due to this disasterous shortterm forethought our whole way of life is about to change big time the once ridiculed gartner group estimate of 300600 billion is now up to 858 billion and will rise even more as we approach the millennium the actual estimated costs if repaired would be 13 trillion dollars the overall costs associated with y2k repairs failures and litigation range from 2 to 4 trillion dollars the litigation due to y2k failure alone at more than a trillion dollars just in the us these cost alone make it the most expensive project in real termsbesides wwiiin history the sheer magnitude of the y2k bug is the reason why it cant be fixed on a systemic basis noncompliant companies can not electronically exchange data with compliant entities ie do business with one another its futile for a company to get its computers compliant when thousands of its suppliers are not or the phone lines are dead or the power is off or the banking system is not functioning see domino effect general motors is experiencing catastrophic problems in all its plants and has 2 billion lines of code to repair in a thirdquarter report released by the sec indicates that out of the 560 million it has budgeted for y2k repairs only 85 million was spent through all of 1998 and 40 through all of 1997 gm has up to 85000 suppliers in order to function gm and all its suppliers must be coordinated and year 2000 compliant considering the small percentage of those who will even complete repairs the potential domino effect can be clearly imagined an entire production line could be shut down from the failure of just a few critical suppliers this will be occuring everywhere all at the same time in every sector of the worlds economy the domino effect is what will bring the economy to a virtual crash throughout year 2000 costs continue to rise beyond all previous expectations as well figure 2 y2k repair estimates 6 company past est millions new estmillions aetna 139 195 att 300 900 bankers trust 180230 220260 cendant

another 500000 experienced programmers that are just not there the few there are may start packing their bags and leave town in 1999 in anticipation of y2k the central fact of software projects 46 late 28 fail or are canceled before completion in very large projects 25 or more million lines 50 are cancelled unrealistic deadlines for y2k projects are frequently quoted the standard quote for completion issued by many corporations for code remediation was dec 311998 leaving a year for testing the vast majority did not come close to making it the gartner group estimated 80 would miss the deadline looking back that number seemed a bit optimistic huh it must be noted after actual inventory assessment and code conversion is done only a fraction the work has been accomplished the remaining 4070 of y2k time and effort involves extensive testing but to be fully compliant means fully tested of those who do have y2k projects half have no plans for testing a survey of 1680 us and european companies by cap gemini america new york finds that 40 percent of respondents do not plan to conduct endtoend year 2000 testing another 50 percent do not plan even testing involving business partners this means guaranteed failure on nov 221998 rep horn rep has given the us government an d grade on its y2k conversion the irs will not make it the department of defense will not make it dept of education labor energy state transportation treasury which issues all govt checks the list is very long it is estimated that only two thirds of its mission critical systems will be ready by 2000 the 1997 third quarter report from the omb office of management and budget showed 27 of mission critical systems were repaired and tested the may 1998 report showed 40 were repaired the latest feb 99 report shows 79 are compliant this is actually a dishonest misrepresentation the number of mission critical systems have actually been systematically lowered by being reclassified as noncritical thereby artificially raising progress rates the may 1998 report shows 7336 systems down from 8562 in the 1997 2nd quarter report the lataest report shows the number of mission critical systems has been lowered to 6404 the actual number of completed systems has not progressed significantly therefore progress has in reality has hardly moved and is extremely slow at current rates of completion they should finished in about a decade or more to see analysis on the us govt and charts of progress click here the social security administration has been converting its 30 million lines of code since 1991 after completing 90 of the conversion in late 1997 it suddenly discovered that it had 33 million more lines to repair it recently said it is now compliantwe should hope so it took 7 years to get to 90 complete and one year to get from 90 to 100 and even this is misleading as it doesnt mention the extra 33 million lines after carefully reading these reports we can conclude that much of the us government is doomed a frightening percentage of world governments corporations and institutions are threatened with overnight computer chaos and extinction of those who have y2k projects many havent even begun any repairs theyre still in the committee forming stage to look into the problemeven those who started repairs years ago will miss the deadline according to a world bank survey 65 percent of the countries surveyed have no y2k programs at all the rest of the world is even farther behind the us in a survey of 139 developing countries the world bank found only 54 had initiated national y2k policies 21 were taking concrete remedial steps to safeguard their computing systems and 33 reported hightomedium awareness of the problem but were not currently taking action in canada according to this report from the global millennium foundation as of march 1999 they have spent less than half of their y2k budgets europe is woefully behind preoccupied with its eurodollar conversion precious y2k resources are being diverted a recent survey showed 74 of german companies will not make it before 2000 japan seems to be doing nothing italy has just barely begun in australian small businesses only 25 are taking action to solve y2k 98 of hong kongs small and medium sized enterpriseswhich form the backbone of hong kongs economy have little or no understanding of the y2k problem as a country the us is the most involved in y2k conversion but will not even be close to full compliance before 2000 so how then can canada australia britain and france possibly succeed when they are 612 months behind the us only recently has the mexican government established a formal commitee to begin assessment asia russia and japan experiencing economic hardships have put y2k repairs on the back burner they too are underestimating the seriousness of y2k and will suffer for it banks are spending billions of dollars in a fullbore last minute scramble to fix it yet it is now 1999 and very few have claimed compliance it may turn out to be an effort in vain even if 70 or 80 it will be less of banks are 100 compliant and tested the remainder will still bring down the international system of finance commerce and means of payment and throw us into a depression a corrupted financial institution can not effectively communicate with a compliant system without creating havoc on the whole system compliant banks would have to cut themselves of from the rest even if 100 of banks are compliant what good would it do when large sectors of business and government are not or if the power goes down or bank runs in 1999 shut them down anyways there are also 2540 billion embedded microsystems 15 of those are not year 2000 compliant but we dont know which ones or where they are they would have to be individually tested and replaced to weed out the bad apples also chips older than 3 years are no longer in production and cant be replaced there has been very little attention paid to the chip problem even though it could according to some experts surpass the mainframe problem only 9 of business and government agencies are attempting to fix defective chips power plants are particularly important and at risk to get all this done before 2000 is not possible and wont be done for the big picture and analysis of how the worlds economic structure will be affected see macroeconomic thesis

american hero can you name any of his great speeches or written works without citing i have a dream or the letter from birmingham jail most americans would likely flub this quiz king may be a national hero whose birthday the country commemorates on monday but to many he remains a onedimensional hero — the vast body of his work unknown though he wrote five books and delivered up to 450 speeches a year hes defined by one speech and one letter what then are the great works by king that never get the attention they deserve thats the question cnn put to some members of kings inner circle as well as top king scholars we asked them to pick their favorite overlooked gems from king any extraordinary spoken or written words people dont typically hear during king commemorations six entries made our final cut three sermons and speeches kings most radical book an astonishing letter he wrote as a college student and a eulogy he delivered for a friend that revealed a side of him the public rarely saw a time to break the silence sermon delivered at riverside church in new york on april 4 1967 why its important this was kings most controversial speech even some members of his own staff warned him not to give it with this sermon king decisively came out against the vietnam war at a time when many americans still supported it people were furious president lyndon johnson stopped talking to him civil rights leaders criticized him and major newspapers told him to stick to civil rights yet king put principle over personal popularity and continued to oppose the war one year later to the day he gave this speech king was assassinated in memphis tennessee what he said money that should have been spent on johnsons war on poverty was being lost in vietnams killing fields he said a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death the speech distilled kings belief that racism economic exploitation and war were all connected as triple evils signature lines we are taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them 8000 miles away to guarantee liberties in southeast asia which they had not found in southwest georgia and east harlem so we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching negro and white boys on tv screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools what others say its dr kings most underappreciated speech says vorris nunley a professor of rhetoric at the university of california riverside former supporters black as well as white backed away from this too compassionate too radical too political king hear lost interview of mlk jr our god is marching on speech delivered on march 25 1965 in montgomery alabama at the end of the selmatomontgomery march why its important it is one of kings most electrifying speeches when the roaring crowd joins king in shouting glory hallelujah at the end of the speech the march becomes a church revival the speech was the culmination of one of the movements most brutal but critical campaigns three civil rights activists were killed and other marchers were beaten at the edmund pettus bridge king gave his defiant speech while standing on the steps of the alabama state capitol in montgomery a city known as the cradle of the confederacy this was the highwater mark of the civil rights movement the selma campaign would spark the passage of the 1965 voting rights act what he said king praised the white clergy and laypeople of various faiths who traveled to selma to face danger with africanamerican protesters he said that segregation was on its deathbed and the movement must now be prepared to march on poverty signature lines they told us we wouldnt get here and there were those who said that we would get here only over their dead bodies but all the world today knows that we are here and that we are standing before the forces of power in the state of alabama saying we aint going to let nobody turn us around i come to say to you this afternoon however difficult the moment however frustrating the hour it will not be long because truth crushed to earth will rise again how long not long because no lie can live forever how long not long because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice what others say the speech marked the triumphant end of the first phase of the civil rights movement — seeking legal and political rights — and the beginning of a new phase focused on economic inequality says jerald podair a history professor at lawrence university in appleton wisconsin we see king at a moment of triumph podair says he is on the steps of the alabama state capitol near the dexter avenue baptist church from which he launched the montgomery bus boycott as alabama gov george wallace cowers in his office with blinds drawn but he also has miles to go america is still an economically and socially divided nation the american dream sermon delivered at ebenezer baptist church in atlanta on july 4 1965 why its important weve heard about kings dream but just two years later he told an audience that his dream had turned into a nightmare kings sermon addresses questions that could have been snatched from todays headlines what is a living wage for workers in menial jobs is income inequality as corrosive as racial injustice what are the challenges of preserving a multicultural democracy what he said king said that class divisions within the united states can be as vicious and evil as a system based on racial injustice king also talked about the dignity of all work saying that even menial workers should make enough so they can live and educate their children and buy a home and have the basic necessities of life signature lines about two years ago now i stood with many of you who stood there in person and all of you who were there in spirit before the lincoln memorial in washington as i came to the end of my speech there i tried to tell the nation about a dream i had i must confess to you this morning that since that sweltering august afternoon in 1963 my dream has often turned into a nightmare i must confess to you this morning that my dream has often turned into a nightmare the rev martin luther king jr ive seen my dream shattered as ive walked the streets of chicago and see negroes young men and women with a sense of utter hopelessness because they cant find any jobs ive seen my dream shattered as ive been through appalachia and ive seen my white brothers along with negroes living in poverty and im concerned about white poverty as much as im concerned about negro poverty what others say the dream is now clearly tied to equal job opportunities and decent wages says thomas jackson author of from civil rights to human rights martin luther king jr and the struggle for economic justice king asks how are you going to have a multiracial democracy if inequality makes life is so harsh and competitive at the bottom where society is most multiracial and multinational mock eulogy delivered just before the 1963 campaign in birmingham alabama why its important every hero becomes a bore at last that quote from the 19th century writer ralph waldo emerson could have applied to king with the rise of the black power movement king seemed dull and obsolete to many youths in the late 1960s who preferred the fire of malcolm x and the black panthers king dressed like an undertaker and carefully measured each word in public but kings mock eulogy reveals that in private king had a wicked sense of humor he was a man who nicknamed one of his top aides lil nigger drank harveys bristol cream sherry and smoked in private and liked playing the dozens an africanamerican tradition of friends goodnaturedly trading insults what he said the moment is grim king is holding a meeting of top staffers in 1963 just before they initiate a campaign in birmingham he warns them that some may not return alive then he breaks the tension by assuring them he would preach a marvelous tribute for anyone who doesnt make it he proceeds by delivering an overthetop eulogy for one of his aides at the meeting andrew young who was often dispatched to negotiate with white leaders because of his nonthreatening demeanor signature lines andy when the klan finally gets you heres what ill preach lord white folks made a big mistake today they have sent home to glory your faithful servant andrew young lord have mercy on the white folks who did this terrible deed they killed the wrong negro in andrew young white folk had a friend so faithful so enduring they should never have harmed a hair on his head of all my associates no one loved white folks as much as andy what others say king lived under the tremendous burden of peoples expectations says jonathan rieder a sociology professor at barnard college in new york who includes kings mock eulogy and other examples of his backstage personality in his book the word of the lord is upon me the righteous performance of martin luther king jr i am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic the rev martin luther king jr by temperament he had a tremendous sense of refinement and dignity rieder says the burden of dignity was always being proper because he was leading people so this was a special moment with his preacher buddies when he could cut loose and renew his spirit to go on letter to coretta written on july 18 1952 to his future wife coretta scott in which king revealed some surprising thoughts on capitalism and communism why its important theres a theory that king adopted more radical economic theories in the last three years of his life but kings 1952 letter reveals he was radical far earlier than most people realize what he said the letter is an intriguing mix of the personal and abstract king woos his future wife by telling her my life without you is like a year without a springtime which comes to give illumination and heat to the atmosphere which has been saturated by the dark cold breeze of winter he then switches gears and starts praising a recent book on economics he has read he says he would certainly welcome the day to come when there will be a nationalization of industry and a better distribution of wealth signature lines i imagine you already know that i am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic and yet i am not so opposed to capitalism that i have failed to see its relative merits it started out with a noble and high motive to block the trade monopolies of nobles but like most human systems it falls victim to the very thing it was revolting against so today capitalism has outlived its usefulness it has brought about a system that takes necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes what others say king steered toward socialism early on says michael g long author of christian peace and nonviolence a documentary history hes speaking about the need for the demise of capitalism the need to nationalize industries early on he has this dream that equality wont happen in america until theres a radical redistribution of wealth where do we go from here chaos or community kings fifth book was published in 196 7 why its important this is kings last — and most radical — book by 1967 he was organizing a poor peoples campaign a plan to dispatch an interracial army of poor people to occupy washington and force the us government to address poverty what he said he takes on black nationalists who ridiculed nonviolence he says the passage of civil rights laws is not enough the country must institute a massive new national program to attack poverty he predicts the civil rights movement will go international as oppressed peoples in other countries adopt nonviolent tactics to combat americas economic colonialism signature lines white americans must recognize that justice for black people can not be achieved without radical changes in the structure of our society the comfortable entrenched the privileged can not continue to tremble at the prospect of change of the status quo this is a multiracial nation where all groups are dependent on each other there is no separate white path to power and fulfillment short of social disaster that does not share power with black aspirations for freedom and human dignity what others say i get so tired of people turning dr king into a dreamer says doreen loury a sociology professor at arcadia university in pennsylvania who says she was blown away by the book when she first read it in the 1960s they made him safe he was a revolutionary httpwwwcnncom20140119uskingspeechesneverheard",

states that followed the warmest may on record for the northern hemisphere – the 327th consecutive month in which the temperature of the entire globe exceeded the 20thcentury average the odds of which occurring by simple chance were 37 x 1099 a number considerably larger than the number of stars in the universe meteorologists reported that this spring was the warmest ever recorded for our nation – in fact it crushed the old record by so much that it represented the largest temperature departure from average of any season on record the same week saudi authorities reported that it had rained in mecca despite a temperature of 109 degrees the hottest downpour in the planets history not that our leaders seemed to notice last month the worlds nations meeting in rio for the 20thanniversary reprise of a massive 1992 environmental summit accomplished nothing unlike george hw bush who flew in for the first conclave barack obama didnt even attend it was a ghost of the glad confident meeting 20 years ago the british journalist george monbiot wrote no one paid it much attention footsteps echoing through the halls once thronged by multitudes since i wrote one of the first books for a general audience about global warming way back in 1989 and since ive spent the intervening decades working ineffectively to slow that warming i can say with some confidence that were losing the fight badly and quickly – losing it because most of all we remain in denial about the peril that human civilization is in when we think about global warming at all the arguments tend to be ideological theological and economic but to grasp the seriousness of our predicament you just need to do a little math for the past year an easy and powerful bit of arithmetical analysis first published by financial analysts in the uk has been making the rounds of environmental conferences and journals but it hasnt yet broken through to the larger public this analysis upends most of the conventional political thinking about climate change and it allows us to understand our precarious – our almostbutnotquitefinally hopeless – position with three simple numbers the first number 2° celsius if the movie had ended in hollywood fashion the copenhagen climate conference in 2009 would have marked the culmination of the global fight to slow a changing climate the worlds nations had gathered in the december gloom of the danish capital for what a leading climate economist sir nicholas stern of britain called the most important gathering since the second world war given what is at stake as danish energy minister connie hedegaard who presided over the conference declared at the time this is our chance if we miss it it could take years before we get a new and better one if ever in the event of course we missed it copenhagen failed spectacularly neither china nor the united states which between them are responsible for 40 percent of global carbon emissions was prepared to offer dramatic concessions and so the conference drifted aimlessly for two weeks until world leaders jetted in for the final day amid considerable chaos president obama took the lead in drafting a facesaving copenhagen accord that fooled very few its purely voluntary agreements committed no one to anything and even if countries signaled their intentions to cut carbon emissions there was no enforcement mechanism copenhagen is a crime scene tonight an angry greenpeace official declared with the guilty men and women fleeing to the airport headline writers were equally brutal copenhagen the munich of our times asked one the accord did contain one important number however in paragraph 1 it formally recognized the scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below two degrees celsius and in the very next paragraph it declared that we agree that deep cuts in global emissions are required so as to hold the increase in global temperature below two degrees celsius by insisting on two degrees – about 36 degrees fahrenheit – the accord ratified positions taken earlier in 2009 by the g8 and the socalled major economies forum it was as conventional as conventional wisdom gets the number first gained prominence in fact at a 1995 climate conference chaired by angela merkel then the german minister of the environment and now the centerright chancellor of the nation some context so far weve raised the average temperature of the planet just under 08 degrees celsius and that has caused far more damage than most scientists expected a third of summer sea ice in the arctic is gone the oceans are 30 percent more acidic and since warm air holds more water vapor than cold the atmosphere over the oceans is a shocking five percent wetter loading the dice for devastating floods given those impacts in fact many scientists have come to think that two degrees is far too lenient a target any number much above one degree involves a gamble writes kerry emanuel of mit a leading authority on hurricanes and the odds become less and less favorable as the temperature goes up thomas lovejoy once the world banks chief biodiversity adviser puts it like this if were seeing what were seeing today at 08 degrees celsius two degrees is simply too much nasa scientist james hansen the planets most prominent climatologist is even blunter the target that has been talked about in international negotiations for two degrees of warming is actually a prescription for longterm disaster at the copenhagen summit a spokesman for small island nations warned that many would not survive a twodegree rise some countries will flatout disappear when delegates from developing nations were warned that two degrees would represent a suicide pact for droughtstricken africa many of them started chanting one degree one africa despite such wellfounded misgivings political realism bested scientific data and the world settled on the twodegree target – indeed its fair to say that its the only thing about climate change the world has settled on all told 167 countries responsible for more than 87 percent of the worlds carbon emissions have signed on to the copenhagen accord endorsing the twodegree target only a few dozen countries have rejected it including kuwait nicaragua and venezuela even the united arab emirates which makes most of its money exporting oil and gas signed on the official position of planet earth at the moment is that we cant raise the temperature more than two degrees celsius – its become the bottomest of bottom lines two degrees continue

            "body": "article there will be blood analogies and analyses of the syrian situation opednews as often noted here one of the very best analysts of the middle east writing today is the acerbic and astute asad abukhalil the angry arab below he offers up a critique of noam chomskys recent take on the situation in syria and finds it marred by false analogies i dont know who chomsky talks to learn about the syrian nonrevolution and i dont know what he is relying on to followup developments on syria but he seems to me woefully illinformed i am quite displeased with his analysis here the worst part is when he draws an analogy to the vietcong vietcong the syrian rebels are reactionary and conservative and antirevolutionary forces and i am talking about the armed bands of the free syrian army which the us considers moderate and not about the obvious rightwing reactionaries of the jihadi groups and cant be compared to communist liberation movements to chomsky i say the syrian rebels are the contras of syria and not the sandinistas of syria and also it is not a coincidence that prince bandar who had helped fund the contras as chomsky remembers is the same man who is now organizing all funding and arming for the syrian rebels i dont want to invoke analogies too much because i detest the asad regime much more than i dislike the sandinistas especially ortega so i am on board in considering the asad regime also a counterrevolutionary regime and his regime is not revolutionary like the sandinistas when they came to power but the syrian rebels supported and armed by the likes of saudi arabia qatar uae jordan us france germany uk among other nonprogressive forces have to be considered for what they are counterrevolutionary forces who are responsible for the gcc hijacking of a potential revolution in syria of course historical analogies are always dicey witness kerry and obamas witless evocations of hitler and the neocon warhawks endless cries of munich in any and every situation where the imperium refrains from or in most cases merely delays the mass indiscriminate slaughter of human beings however used judiciously and informed by historical knowledge and nuance they can be of some use in helping put current situations in a broader context in the case of syria i think the most useful historical analogy might be afghanistan in late 70s and 80s then as now you have an unsavory and often brutal oneparty state committed to secularism and modernity beset by an insurgency led by retrograde religious fundamentalists armed and financed by saudi arabia and the united states in both cases the secular government is backed by the kremlin on a side note the soviets didnt actually send troops into afghanistan at the request of the sitting government until the ussaudibacked holy war along with interparty feuding on the government side had reduced the country to a state of violent chaos which as zbigniew brzezinski tells us was the plan all along to destroy afghanistans secular society kill off its imperfect but impressive strides toward social equality and progress and bait the soviet union into a quagmire by creating an armed global jihad movement this americansaudi golem of global jihad has long since escaped the control of its creators of course and gone rampaging around the world although as we see now in syria and saw in libya sometimes the golem and its fashioners are happily reunited and work together toward the same ends the kremlin wont be sending in troops to rescue an ally this time of course but if americansaudi efforts to bring down the syrian government are successful the result will likely be a good deal like what we saw in afghanistan the ultimate triumph of violent extremism after years of vicious sectarian conflict and warlordism but our own gilded warlords and their scurrying sycophants wont care about that it will just be yet another boiling pot of danger and instability to keep the money and power flowing to their system of fearbased rule ii many people are rightly pointing to an analysis of the syrian situation by william polk which i ran across while writing the above while polk is very much a man of the establishment he has put together a dispassionate informative overview of the situation that in the end makes a compelling case for the immediate idiocy and longterm tragedy of western intervention in the syrian civil war polk gathers up what is known for certain about the gas attack very little what is not known for certain almost everything and what has been reported almost all of it specious speculative and spinridden when it is not brazenly false he also provides a cogent encapsulation of the hydraheaded syrian opposition and lays out the arguments on who would actually benefit from launching a chemical attack in this situation but beyond this polk also points to the very specific physical realities underlying the outbreak of the uprising which goes back to bedrock realities that have bedeviled human communities from the beginning of time drought hunger the basic need for food water shelter sustenance these basic issues have a modern twist however having been exacerbated by the effects of climate change which is even now sending destructive if largely hidden shockwaves through human civilization long before any worstcase dystopian scenarios of sunken cities and parched continents become a reality as polk points out syria has been struggling with a drought of biblical proportions since the middle of the last decade the results have been devastating in some areas all agriculture ceased in others crop failures reached 75 and generally as much as 85 of livestock died of thirst or hunger hundreds of thousands of syrias farmers gave up abandoned their farms and fled to the cities and towns in search of almost nonexistent jobs and severely short food supplies outside observers including un experts estimated that between 2 and 3 million of syrias 10 million rural inhabitants were reduced to extreme poverty the domestic syrian refugees immediately found that they had to compete not only with one another for scarce food water and jobs but also with the already existing foreign refugee population syria already was a refuge for quarter of a million palestinians and about a hundred thousand people who had fled the war and occupation of iraq formerly prosperous farmers were lucky to get jobs as hawkers or street sweepers and in the desperation of the times hostilities erupted among groups that were competing just to survive here we see physical realities like drought and climate change are compounded by the political realities of war and aggression as syria continues to bear the burden of the american invasion of iraq and the israeli displacement of palestinians the effect of power politics was also evident in a decision made in washington that worsened the situation and sent it spiraling toward the flashpoint of conflict and repression as polk notes the senior un food and agriculture organization fao representative in syria turned to the usaid program for help terming the situation a perfect storm in november 2008 he warned that syria faced social destruction he noted that the syrian minister of agriculture had stated publicly that the economic and social fallout from the drought was beyond our capacity as a country to deal with but his appeal fell on deaf ears the usaid director commented that we question whether limited usg resources should be directed toward this appeal at this time reported on november 26 2008 in cable 08damascus847a to washington and leaked to wikileaks syrias suffering people were not to be helped because their government was now on the outs with the potomac imperium just a few years before washington was happy to render innocent people like maher arar to be tortured in syrian prisons as part of the great gwot jihad see the inhuman stain saying yes to state terror and this followup but by 2008 syria was once again a pariah state chiefly due to its alliance with iran so a chance for a true humanitarian intervention in syria one that might have helped stave off social breakdown and the horrific violence that has followed was thrown away left to its own devices the cackhanded asad regime then bungled and brutalized its way into an uprising that was very quickly hijacked by outside forces as abukhalil noted above polk writes lured by the high price of wheat on the world market it sold its reserves in 2006 according to the us department of agriculture it sold 1500000 metric tons or twice as much as in the previous year the next year it had little left to export in 2008 and for the rest of the drought years it had to import enough wheat to keep its citizens alive so tens of thousands of frightened angry hungry and impoverished former farmers flooded constituted a tinder that was ready to catch fire the spark was struck on march 15 2011 when a relatively small group gathered in the town of daraa to protest against government failure to help them instead of meeting with the protestors and at least hearing their complaints the government cracked down on them as subversives the assads who had ruled the country since 1971 were not known for political openness or popular sensitivity and their action backfired riots broke out all over the country as they did the assads attempted to quell them with military force they failed to do so and as outside help money from the gulf states and muslim freedom fighters from the rest of the world poured into the country the government lost control over 30 of the countrys rural areas and perhaps half of its population by the spring of 2013 according to the united nations high commission for refugees unhcr upwards of 100000 people had been killed in the fighting perhaps 2 million have lost their homes and upwards of 2 million have fled abroad additionally vast amounts of infrastructure virtually whole cities like aleppo have been destroyed in his conclusion polk also draws an analogy between the current situation in syria and the saudiamerican intervention in afghanistan 30 years ago after noting the nearinevitability of mission creep involved in obamas plan to kill syrians polk asks the question what could we possibly gain from an attack on syria his answer is grim even if he wanted to could assad meet our demands he could of course abdicate but this would probably not stop the war both because his likely successor would be someone in the inner circle of his regime and because the rebels form no cohesive group the likely result would be something like what happened after the fall of the taliban in afghanistan a vicious civil war among competing factions no one of course can know what would happen then my hunch is that syria like afghanistan would be torn apart not only into large chunks such as the kurds in the northeast but even neighborhood by neighborhood as in the iraqi cities muslims would take revenge on alawis and christians who would be fighting for their lives more millions would be driven out of their homes food would be desperately short and disease probably rampant if we are worried about a haven for terrorists or drug traffickers syria would be hard to beat and if we are concerned about a sinkhole for american treasure syria would compete well with iraq and afghanistan it would probably be difficult or even impossible to avoid boots on the ground there so we are talking about casualties wounded people and perhaps wastage of another several trillion dollars which we dont have to spend and which if we had we need to use in our own country for better heath education creation of jobs and rebuilding of our infrastructure",

            "body": "how long not long the struggle continues write time for peace last summer michigan coalition for human rights sent 34 young people and 12 adult mentors on an exhilarating and at times exhausting freedom tour of the south where we visited historic civil rights sites and met with great nonviolent warriors for justice in georgia alabama and mississippi organizing freedom tour required months of logistical planning and recruiting as well as developing an educational formation program for our youth and mentors that included a community service component before we boarded the bus we had to gather a mountain of legal forms and paperwork and accomplish the daunting goal of raising over 100000 to cover the cost of the tour for over a year michigan coalition for human rights an organization committed to justice issues across the board devoted the lions share of its time and resources to freedom tour when we finally left detroit at the break of dawn on june 16 we were a diverse intergenerational community we were black brown white and red we were from detroit traverse city and oakland county we were from public schools private schools home schools we were straight and we were gay some were wellseasoned activists others were neophytes all of us were open to what freedom tour had to teach us and what a soulshaking lifechanging education we received while we were on the road for those two weeks i teach in a jesuit school where we often tell our students that the experiences that take us out of our comfort zones and show us new worlds and perspectives can ruin us for life i believe there is great truth to this maxim experiences like freedom tour have the ability to ruin unchallenged assumptions to ruin an unconscious acquiescence to injustice borne of a sense of powerlessness and despair to ruin complacency sometimes to maybe even ruin welllaid plans for the future yes i deeply believe that some experiences can ruin us to such an extent that we cant help but give ourselves over to lives of service lives committed to justice lives devoted to building what dr king called the beloved community my prayer as we headed down i75 last summer was that all of us would be ruined for life as a result of our participation in freedom tour in fact this was the point in organizing freedom tour all along the herculean task of organizing the million and one details that go into such a trip was bearable only to the extent that we held onto the vision of transformed lives lives committed to carrying the torch of peace justice and human rights into the future a vision of hands reaching from the civil rights movement of the past to the struggles of today a vision of new voices raising new freedom songs in an idiom suited to this generation and this moment in history reflecting on the past nine months i see that my prayer was answered and that the vision that drove freedom tour is indeed taking root one of the misconceptions that some people had about freedom tour was that it was only about history a nostalgic look at a movement of long ago a twoweek field trip through the museums of the south nothing could be further from the truth to reduce freedom tour to a mere tribute to the past is to misread entirely not only the objective of michigan coalition for human rights but history itself as if history were comprised of neat segments of time as clearly delineated as chapters in a high school text book no our driving mission was to connect the struggles of the past to presentday struggles in order to help all of us better connect the destructive dots of materialism racism and militarism the giant triplets of evil described by dr king in his breaking the silence speech rather than see the civil rights movement as a golden moment frozen in time a time that is long past we grounded the tour in the words of dr king who said the moral arc of the universe is long but it bends toward justice this means that the work of justice is fluid and never static continuous and never fully completed hopefilled and never despairing it is work that must be passed on from generation to generation if we accept kings statement we are not afforded the luxury of being passive observers of history rather history demands that we roll up our sleeves and use all the love and courage and creativity we can muster during our short time on this earth to help bend this often stubborn and unyielding arc a little closer to justice and this is why we organized freedom tour we organized freedom tour to help our youth discern their gifts and passions and to help them develop the spiritual muscles needed to engage in some serious arc bending to help them see that there is nothing soft easy or romantic about the work of peace and justice the great scholaractivist dr cornel west writes of what he calls the santa clausification of leaders like dr king and nelson mandela santa clausification refers to the tendency to place people on pedestals while sanitizing and softening the hard edges of their message and lifes work the tendency to sentimentalize which only serves to marginalize to reduce our fiery lions of justice into declawed teddy bears of popular mythology to turn our prophets – who in their own day were persecuted prosecuted and often killed – into safe public icons who are celebrated but seldom studied much less followed we were acutely aware of this tendency as we planned the trip so we were diligent in providing a contemporary context for everything we did while on the road we did this in order to help us better see the continuum of justice along an arc that spans the past present and future and to help us better understand the risks that are always an inherent part of the struggle for justice – both then and now i apologize for this long preface explaining our rationale in organizing freedom tour but i think it is important to articulate the primary purpose of the tour while it would be wonderful to show you a colorful power point of our trip and offer you a detailed account of our itinerary i think it is far more important to share the heart of the trip which was nothing less than helping young people make the connection between struggles past and present in order to prepare them to continue the long challenging march toward freedom in their own day given the crises facing us today we would never have spent the time money or energy or spent twoweeks in the southern heat on a crowded bus for the mere purpose of revisiting the past – as important as that past is in the time i have left i would like to make some connections between a few of the people we met and the places we visited and some of todays struggles that are straining to bend historys arc a little closer to justice during our first week on the tour we participated in an intensive fourday nonviolence training at the king center in atlanta georgia for several hours a day we were steeped in the principles of kingian nonviolence examining their application to situations of violence today – whether that violence takes place on the level of the playground or the pentagon as a nonviolence trainer with meta peace team formerly michigan peace team i am here to tell you that active nonviolence and the training it requires is evidence of the universe bending in a good direction despite what appears to be evidence to the contrary the world is increasingly turning toward nonviolence as a way to settle differences from the implementation of restorative justice circles in schools and courtrooms to nonviolent peoplepowered revolutions around the world nonviolence is an idea whose time has come built on the backs of such a diverse group as henry david thoreau leo tolstoi mahatma gandhi badshah khan and martin luther king active nonviolence is taking hold in a groundbreaking book entitled why civil resistance works scholars erica chenoweth and maria stephan make the wellresearched and documented claim that since the beginning of the 20th century nonviolent resistance campaigns have been more than twice as effective as violent campaigns for change as we speak meta peace team is on a national training tour offering nonviolent trainings around the country to large groups of people i was in oregon at portland state university a few weeks ago where we trained over 80 college students and community members and will be heading to washington dc in a couple of weeks to help out with the east coast leg of the tour only a few nights ago i was part of a monthly conference call involving over 70 people from around the country who are part of a national effort called campaign nonviolence a broad coalition campaign that is calling for a week of nonviolent actions in late september actions calling for an end to war poverty and environmental degradation these are only a few of the many harbingers of hope suggesting that people are waking up to the goodness and efficacy of nonviolence the rigorous training that our youth received in atlanta connects them to this great continuum of nonviolence and gives them some of the tools they will need to help move their generation forward from atlanta our group went to mississippi to commemorate the anniversary of the martyrdom of the three civil rights workers james chaney andrew goodman and michael schwerner as we drove through the dark twisted backwoods of philadelphia to the very site where the three were slain our bus was flanked by police cars our hosts told us that we were being watched and followed and recounted stories of the brutal repercussions they suffered after each years commemoration the shell of a burned out house near where we held a picnic later in the day stands as a reminder of one such incident orchestrated by local members of the ku klux klan some of the students were scared when we parked the bus on a dusty deserted street in downtown meridian where we joined our hosts and fellow visitors for a march through empty streets to city hall where a spirited rally was organized by local activists the names of the mississippi martyrs whose spirits surrounded us were invoked as we rallied against the schooltoprison pipeline socalled righttowork laws and everwidening gap between rich and poor the reality of ongoing struggle was nowhere more gripping than here in mississippi where we learned that lynchings still occur in the dead of night and that shots are still fired at the tombstone of james chaney the immediacy of the struggle was brought home to me by one of our young women who was too scared to get off the bus in meridian a few of us coaxed her out of her bus seat by taking her hand and offering to walk with her for her this was as frightening and real as it must have been for those taking to streets of the south in the 1960s although she was not met with dogs and fire hoses said she felt the stares of a thousand hostile eyes looking at her from behind shuttered blinds for her this was not about history it was about the reality of racism today as we walked arm in arm down the street i thought of abraham joshua heschel the great rabbi who said that when he walked in the selma to montgomery march felt as though he had been praying with his feet heschels words became very real to me as i watched this young woman grow more confident with each step as she grabbed hold of that inexplicable spiritual power that comes when one is walking righteously for something greater than ones self my final image of mississippi is of our bus leaving a small rural baptist church where we had gathered with great movement leaders such as diane nash who talked to us of agapic love and the connection between struggles past and present as dusk was descending our driver kae whose family lives in this area demanded that we get off the back roads before nightfall her nervousness about our being in this isolated area in the dark was palpable and a sad reminder of how far we have to go as a nation from mississippi we moved on to alabama and then back again to georgia where we met people and visited places that helped us grab hold of the arc that we are now being asked to bend as we journeyed the connections between past and present became more and more apparent and at times even serendipitous if i can use that word in the context of injustice perhaps the greatest most explicit most devastating link between then and now occurred at the very moment –the exact time – that we were walking across the edmund pettus bridge as we walked toward the historic bridge on that sunny selma afternoon we carried signs calling for an end to the schooltoprison pipeline and an end to war for cities free from emergency managers and for neighborhoods free from violence for alternative energy and for food security for peace for unity for love at the very moment we were marching over the summit of the bridge we received word that the supreme court had just struck down section 4 of the voting rights act a stunning and major setback for civil rights all of us were heartbroken by this news and stung by the irony of the timing over and over our teachers along the way reminded us that we must be vigilant about protecting hardwon rights that can be taken away in an instant the wisdom of their warning was borne out that day this was a sobering and important lesson that left us feeling dispirited and depressed other lessons were more inspiring none of us will ever forget our beautiful meeting with 107yearold amelia robinson boynton the deeply spiritual civil rights warrior who in her younger years was left for dead on the pettus bridge on bloody sunday after state police and armed citizens deputized for the purpose of inflicting violence upon marchers beat her and others mercilessly as we sat at her feet and listened to stories of courage and grace i was reminded of the importance of elders across time and movements and offered thanks for people like jimmy carter desmond tutu and grace lee boggs elders whose experience and wisdom reminds us that the we are in this for the long haul who remind us that we need to keep our eyes on the prize and as the song goes keep our hand on the freedom plow another graced moment of insight occurred as we stood on the side of highway 80 next to a monument pocked with bullet holes where detroiter viola liuzzo was gunned down for daring to drive a black man home after the successful selma to montgomery march reflecting on mrs liuzzos life i thought of the high cost of solidarity viola liuzzo was the only white woman martyred in the movement as we stood silently my mind turned to rachel corrie the young peace activist from olympia washington who was crushed by an armored idf bulldozer while trying to prevent a home demolition in the gaza strip both women were slandered and vilified after their deaths as i pondered the lives of these two beautiful women who died so violently i realized that there is a special venom reserved for those who use their privilege in the service of justice for those who step outside the boundaries of race class nation gender or sexual orientation to be an ally then or now is no small thing and usually comes with a cost this same theme of solidarity and crossing boundaries was brought home to me on the final leg of our trip when we visited kentuckys berea college the first integrated college in the south where today children of the working class and poor can attend college for free in return for service work what a gift it was for all of us to be in a place that honors diversity and inclusion the juxtaposition of hallowed ground like this and the bloodstained roadsides where hate had its way if only for a moment was sometimes jarring in the end we were given the grace of seeing what seems like an intractable and immoveable arc extending into our day – a goliath of an arc that seems to be too much for us – an arc colored by racism climate change war income disparity and so on this was a grace because it allowed us to grasp the enormity of the struggle before us and the need to be fully awake and engaged and in community with one another at the same time however we were given an even greater grace to see a movement that is stronger than we know a movement that plants its feet and continues to sing we shall not be moved a movement that reaches far back in time and far into the future a movement made up of the nameless and numberless foot soldiers who through history have prayed marched sang and organized for freedom and dignity a movement being lived out in places like koinonia farm where we experienced deep community rooted in environmental sustainability and spirituality a movement that continues in the streets of downtown meridian and downtown detroit a movement that needs everyone who was on the bus and everyone who is in this church today after the third and finally successful march from selma to montgomery dr king gave a speech entitled god is marching on i would like to close by quoting from that speech acknowledging the movements justifiable impatience with pervasive injustice dr king responded to the question how long will it take this is a perennial question that echoes through time in places where people have had enough it is a question that we ask ourselves on those days when

how long not long because no lie can live forever how long not long because you reap what you sow how long not long truth forever on the scaffold wrong forever on the throne yet that scaffold sways the future and behind the dim unknown standeth god within the shadow keeping watch above his own how long not long because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice amen

credibility of the secretive european central bank ecb and 3 the fear that selfimposed austerity measures are likely to smother any chance of economic recovery in europe threat to the status quo under the current structure and with the current membership the euro is clearly not working the problem facing the euro now is to convince the world that it is more than an act of political levitation underpinned by a series of inconsequential summits that announce a plethora of smokeandmirror policies although the official line has been for month to say that the euro will somehow pull through rising bond market volatility suggests that it most probably will not this is not merely a question of putting trillions of euros together to bail out weaker member nations but creating an organisational structure that will give the currency robustness and resilience which it appears to lack at a fundamental level at present the euro creates more economic costs than benefits for at least some of its members a fact that has become painfully obvious to some of its participants in recent years either the current structure will have to change or the current membership will change the eurozone statusquo can not remain intact exit scenarios if a weaker country such as one of the piigs portugal ireland italy greece or spain leaves the euro the consequences include 1 sovereign default 2 corporate default 3 collapse of the banking system at least in part 4 collapse of international trade and interruptions of supply chains and 5 devaluation of a new currency which may offer limited assistance in the short term as import costs cause inflation italy and spain rank 3rd and 4th within the eurozone in terms of population gdp and contribution to the eu budget together italy and spain make up about a quarter of the eu contributions and together they are bigger than germany and substantially bigger than france that suggests just how grave the situation really is especially from germanys perspective and why the germans know that they cant save themselves as well as italy and spain simultaneously if a stronger country such as germany or france leaves the euro the consequences include 1 corporate default 2 recapitalisation of the banking system 3 collapse of international trade and interruptions of supply chains and 4 appreciation of a new currency which may offer limited assistance in the short term as export prices rise and economic activity begins to stall banking system contagion the banking system is likely to be the most immediate transmission mechanism for carrying the crisis beyond the borders of the nation state seeking exit if bank runs and enforced conversions in the exiting state are witnessed elsewhere in the eurozone citizens of any euro member state that is considered to be a possible candidate for secession would start to liquidate across all asset classes and withdraw their bank deposits from their domestic banking system out of fear and panic this is already happening in the case of greece and beginning to happen in the cases of italy and spain bank runs could spread well before the actual act of secession can takes place therefore the bank runs could become a catalyst for a more widespread financial crisis in the eurozone system as well as the global financial sector this could be mitigated by the intervention of the local central banks to a small extent as far as their domestic needs are concerned on a transnational basis large capital flows are likely to carry the contagion to many financial centres around the world this also means that noneurozone financial institutions particularly us ones would come under pressure due to their exposure to bank financing with european banks through money markets and repurchase agreements resilience and robustness it seems highly unlikely that a government could leave the euro and expect to remain a fully functioning member of the european union itself the act of leaving the euro necessitates a unilateral breach of the treaty of maastricht the treaty of lisbon and by extension the treaty of rome yet we find in those treaties themselves and in the rhetoric which surrounded them the primary delusions behind the creation of the single european currency 1 the belief that political vision can defy markets 2 the belief that a unified currency could underpin europes place in the world politically and economically and 3 the belief that such a currency should be the most significant physical manifestation of europes desire for unification it is clear that these widely mooted viewpoints have bestowed some mystical powers upon the euro allowing it to exist in reality it neither has mystical powers nor the divine right to exist the euro architects managed to convince the world for 12 years that its major flaws were minor inconveniences if its least significant member greece can tip it into a fullblown crisis after only these few years where is the resilience and robustness in its system architecture hedging and financial markets for institutional as well as private investors the only way to hedge against a euro breakup scenario would be to minimise the ownership of paper assets denominated in euros the impact of the eurozone breakup will be to cause the global financial markets to become extremely volatile and dysfunctional this in turn may cause the quadrillion dollar derivatives pyramid to crumble generating massive counterparty losses and systemic risk amongst financial institutions soft power fragmentation of the euro would incur political costs as well the european political union would cease to exist in the way we have come to know it europes soft power influence internationally would fade as the concept of europe as an integrated political entity would be rendered meaningless social economic and political chaos it is certainly worth noting that several countries in the euro area have histories of internal political division belgium italy and spain being amongst the most obvious examples those divisions are likely to be exacerbated as a result of a breakup of the eurozone this could contribute to greater social unrest in those countries it is also true that monetary union breakups in history are nearly always accompanied by extremes of civil disorder civil war or anarchy we have already seen the beginnings of civil disturbances like the opposition to the imfeuecb rescue packages manifest in countries such as greece ireland and portugal as well as new rumblings in italy and spain to quote lord keynes lenin was certainly right there is no subtler no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency almost no modern monetary unions built around fiat currencies have broken up without the rise of some form of authoritarian or military government not to mention the breakout of civil war or its equivalent along the way if a country has gone to the extreme of reversing the introduction of the euro it is at least plausible that fracturing forces may reemerge to break apart key political and other structures of its society at the very least escalating social unrest seems inevitable new equilibrium romano prodi the then eu commission president said in december 2001 i am sure the euro will oblige us to introduce a new set of economic policy instruments it is politically impossible to propose that now but some day there will be a crisis and new instruments will be created the process of disintegration of the financial and banking system in europe even if only in part is now a highly probable outcome resulting from cascading events underway on the other hand in the hegelian tradition of how change happens transformation is bound to take place in the way that europe manages itself the specific steps on the path to disintegration or its lesser cousins can not be fully anticipated at this juncture and in the end they are likely to be a source of surprise for us all conclusion it is becoming increasingly obvious that the eurozone is going to experience the exit of one of its member countries in the very near future the cascading consequences pose existential challenges for the eurozone and the european union given the nature of the interlinked global financial markets the rest of the world including the united states and china will not remain unscathed china has placed significant faith in the eurozone in recent years as the european union has become its number one export market to park its excess reserves and it may have to reassess its strategy of portfolio diversification away from the us as the eurozone crumbles let us not underestimate the gravity of the crisis we are going through and its potential outcomes however we should also consider the possibility that in the midst of crisis political leaders may respond by radically revising their hitherto entrenched positions it remains plausible that out of this historic crisis a more sober and realistic political ethos in the region may yet emerge one that could eventually lead to a renaissance towards a more sustainable europe in the years ahead the scale of the crisis viewed through the prism of history could yet generate opportunities to lead europe forwards in a fundamentally different way this article originally appeared at mi2g copyright 2014",

            "body": "groynes will not prevent overtopping stabroek news georgetown guyana dear editor over recent months there has been disaster after disaster at the sea wall from kitty to liliendaal this is the result of a situation similar to that which winston churchill outlined in his famous speech on november 12 1936 in the british parliament i have taken the liberty of adjusting it somewhat for the guyana situation by adding the two words incompetence and corruption as follows they go on in a strange paradox decided only to be undecided resolved to be irresolute adamant for drift solid for fluidity allpowerful to be impotent corrupt and incompetent owing to past neglect in the face of the plainest warnings we have entered upon a period of danger the era of procrastination of half measures of soothing and baffling expedience of delays of incompetence and corruption is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences at least the british had churchill to help them out of the mess they found themselves in at that time totally unprepared to deal with hitler but here in guyana of all the people on this planet who we have to depend on to steer us out of this morass of incompetence confusion and indecisiveness is someone called robson benn who thinks that jettiesgroynes are there to stop wave action on our seawall to stop overtopping and is wasting our money rebuilding them they are there for an entirely different reason anyone expecting that groynes can stop overtopping of the seawall is in for a big shock see also charles sohans letter last week sn may 17 the answer to this problem is to raise the sea defences 6ft with riprap from kitty to liliendaal the wikipedia dictionaryencyclopaedia tells us that a groyne is a rigid hydraulic structure built from an ocean shore in coastal engineering or from a bank in rivers that interrupts water flow and limits the movement of sediment in the ocean groynes create beaches or avoid having them washed away by longshore drift so you dont have to be an engineer to tell that mr benn and his advisors are completely wrong just look in a dictionary we are no better off in other areas we have robert persaud whose arrogance and incompetence as a minister of agriculture is still apparent especially with regard to his greatest failure the decline of the sugar industry during his tenure as minister 20062011 the industry performed as follows in 2006 industry production was 259470 tonnes dropping by 2012 to 218688 tonnes and still falling during this time the european union gave guyana 276 billion to resuscitatediversify the industry to make it more competitive no one knows where this money went he is now overseeing the mining industry as well the only viable industry we have left i am not going to try to analyse all of the incompetence we have in our countrys governance but i have to mention our attorney general mr anil nandlall as the governments top legal political appointee ‒ he who convened a press conference in freedom house last week is paramountcy of the party still alive in this country he continually violates the law by attempting to block the decisions of the guyana parliament and as such he is constantly violating the constitution he first accuses a section of the media of racially profiling the award of the radio licences and uses the ridiculous concept that the licences were not issued racially since there was a geographic evenness in the way they were awarded this rubbish is total contempt for my intelligence in addition for him to tell us now that the licences were issued to people who had the means to operate a radio station is ludicrous and unacceptable no one is aware that people who had previously applied were called in to assess whether they had the means to operate a radio station before mr jagdeo issued them these misrepresentations and stupid excuses are perpetrated to hide the real agenda of the ppp which is to make everyone else impotent in this country to properly finance an election to challenge them so that they can stay in power but in fact there was an agreement between the ppp and the opposition which is stated clearly in the dialogue as to how the licences should be issued since the bipartisan committee on broadcasting cochaired by gail teixeira and dereck bernard had recommended which both sides signed on to that the most important method of selection of radio and television owners was to choose owners who reflected the ethnic composition of the areas to be served i am appealing to the opposition again publicly the broadcast authority should be immediately dissolved and replaced with a more bipartisan independent and autonomous one and the method of their selection must guarantee their independence if not the consequences will be that in any future election the opposition will have no voice the people of this nation due to their lack of interest in the quality of their governance who are interested only in racial voting and are swayed by the falsehoods perpetrated by the ppp will continue to pay the penalty yours faithfully tony vieira",

issue 43 submit a story the following articles were printed from new times newtimesslocom volume 28 issue 43 climate crisis has no party affiliation we must unite against a problem that is impacting us all by heidi harmon owing to past neglect in the face of the plainest warnings we have now entered upon a period of danger the era of procrastination of halfmeasures of soothing and baffling delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences we can not avoid this period we are in it now this quote isnt from the white houses national climate assessment report although it could be these words are winston churchills on the eve of world war ii as the reality of the desperate situation europeans faced became understood and the worlds responsibility to act became urgent the world again faces a historical moment that challenges us to face our reality and act accordingly the national climate assessment report confirms what scientists have been saying with everincreasing certainty climate change and the crisis it is causing is all around us and we are already feeling the impacts the report states climate change once considered an issue for the distant future has moved firmly into the present to be clear we are not talking about our childrens children we are talking about you and me and all of the people we love being at great risk from the multiple outcomes of climate crisis rain patterns are changing sea level is rising the oceans are acidifying extreme drought and catastrophic wild fires are more likely and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather is increasing to summarize the 800page report we are faced with drought downpours and disease we see these effects here on the central coast with our longterm drought decreased agricultural yields and the recent recordbreaking heat vast amounts of independent evidence confirm these trends and demonstrate that they are the result of warming due largely to human activities up to this moment the climate change conversation has been framed by many as a political battle there are those who suggest this as an issue of conservative vs liberal ideas but thermometers have no political party wildfires blaze their own trail sea level rise will sink all boats at the most divisive time in recent political history we stand against a common foe the most universal foe in human history climate crisis has and will hit those communities hardest that have done the least to contribute to it and are the least able to combat it for this reason alone we must take action as we have a moral obligation to do so but climate has no borders and it is affecting everyone regardless of economic standing or political allegiance this challenge doesnt have to be a burden but can instead be an opportunity to bring us together to create the political will and technological opportunities to solve it the time to act is now the united states and california in particular should be on the forefront of an energy policy supporting technologies to replace fossil fuels we as citizens must demand that our leaders create the pathways to get us off the oil pipeline and on to the innovation pipeline the cost of inaction is great for every dollar we spend today on the mitigation of carbon and climate crisis adaptation strategies we save ourselves at least three dollars just by 2020 we need polices like a revenueneutral carbon incentive that will put market pressure on fossil fuels to create the economically viable pathways to green energy we need the creation of infrastructure that will support these new energies in addition to infrastructure support that will withstand the increased pressure put on existing systems climate change is the greatest threat to our national economy and our national security many businesses and universities are currently working on the solutions we need to move forward in a sustainable way dr mark jacobson at stanford university has a wellresearched and understood plan called the solutions project his plan clearly demonstrates how to get the united states on 100 percent renewable energy by 2050 we can eliminate combustion as a source of energy by utilizing our natural renewable resources the sun gives enough energy in one hour to power the earth for a year and the technology needed for capturing and storing this energy is getting better and cheaper we only need 2 percent of us land mass to support all the wind solar and hydro power required to meet energy demand it is possible now with existing technology all we need now is the political will innovation hope and imagination made this country what it is the united states has stepped up to great challenges before and we are capable of meeting the call today it is time to demand that our leadership bring us into the green energy future that we require to survive a total of 143 million has been spent in california alone by oil companies over the last 15 years supporting candidates and campaigns that support fossil fuels this oil money has corrupted our leaders will and puts into question their allegiance to the people of this state we need leadership with the vision strategy and most importantly the courage to no longer put the shortterm economic gains of the carbon cartels over the long term viability of the people we need system change to fight climate change what we do in the next two years will decide the next 200 its time to vote like climate matters because it does heidi harmon lives in san luis obispo and is a candidate for californias

creation pope francis made the religious case for tackling climate change this week think progress reports pope francis makes biblical case for addressing climate change if we destroy creation creation will destroy us pope francis made the religious case for tackling climate change on wednesday calling on his fellow christians to become custodians of creation and issuing a dire warning about the potentially catastrophic effects of global climate change speaking to a massive crowd in rome the first argentinian pope delivered a short address in which he argued that respect for the beauty of nature and the grandeur of the cosmos is a christian value noting that failure to care for the planet risks apocalyptic consequences safeguard creation he said because if we destroy creation creation will destroy us never forget this the pope centered his environmentalist theology around the biblical creation story in the book of genesis where god is said to have created the world declared it good and charged humanity with its care francis also made reference to his namesake saint francis of assisi who was a famous lover of animals and appeared to tie the ongoing environmental crisis to economic concerns — namely instances where a wealthy minority exploits the planet at the expense of the poor creation is not a property which we can rule over at will or even less is the property of only a few creation is a gift it is a wonderful gift that god has given us so that we care for it and we use it for the benefit of all always with great respect and gratitude francis said francis also said that humanitys destruction of the planet is a sinful act likening it to selfidolatry but when we exploit creation we destroy the sign of gods love for us in destroying creation we are saying to god i dont like it this is not good so what do you like i like myself – here this is sin do you see the popes comments come on the heels of a fiveday summit on sustainability convened at the vatican earlier this month the summit entitled sustainable humanity sustainable nature our responsibility drew together microbiologists legal scholars economists philosophers astronomers and other experts to discuss ways for the catholic church to address a range issues caused by climate change in a joint statement published after the close of the conference participants echoed francis belief that environmental justice and economic justice are inextricably linked human action which is not respectful of nature becomes a boomerang for human beings that creates inequality and extends what pope francis has termed the globalization of indifference and the economy of exclusion evangelii gaudium which themselves endanger solidarity with present and future generations the statement read the pontiffs catechesis and the vaticans summit appear to be part of a renewed effort by the catholic church to draw attention to environmental issues keeping with a long history of catholic environmentalism including several proenvironmentalist sermons delivered by pope benedict xvi francis predecessor francis addressed climate change in his inaugural mass as pope and is rumored to be working on a formal encyclical on the environment and its not just the pope in rome american evangelicals say that climate change is a prolife issue for them evangelical group climate change is a prolife issue mitigate and adapt to climate change hoping that their message will resonate with scotts staunch christian values rev mitch hescox president of the evangelical environmental network een is leading the groups campaign for scott to recognize climate change as a major threat in florida een is collecting signatures for a petition asking gov scott to create a plan for climate change one which so far has garnered about 12000 signatures hescox told thinkprogress that een chose to focus on florida because of its vulnerability to climate change — floridians especially in the southeast region of the state are already struggling to adapt to rising seas that lead to sunnyday flooding and stronger storm surges we wanted to help the evangelical church understand in florida that climate change is not a liberal issue or any issue other than a people issue he said hescox said were hoping that with his values and his understanding of scripture that helping him to understand climate change in a way that uses the values that he and i probably share — more conservative prolife values — will help him understand climate change is a real and very big threat to florida that way of looking at environmental issues in a biblical lens is one thats central to the eens work the group emphasizes creation care the idea that humans have a duty to take care of the earth because the earth and its creatures are the creation of god and to love gods creation is to love god the group also notes that the poor are often those who are affected most by pollution and many christians believe they have a duty to help the poor the first real handbook of sustainability is the biblical book of leviticus it talks about crop rotation about how to care about animals hescox said thats why its a matter of life for us — everything we do as human beings to mess up gods creation impacts human life hescox pointed to the suffering climate change has caused around the world as reason why climate change is something christians should care about air pollution is linked to asthma kidney disease and heart problems and climate change is expected to cause a rise in vectorborne illnesses like malaria and west nile these are some of the most compelling reasons to act on climate change hescox said for us its a prolife issue he said we are prolife from conception to natural death and we believe anything that affects the quality of life is something thats a prolife value hescox said he plans to deliver the petition to gov scott in the coming weeks and hes also participating a panel at a church in florida on tuesday on why christians should care about climate change hes done these types of panels in other states before he said and thinks churchgoers have been very receptive to his ideas hes hoping gov scott will be too not the typical message you hear from the energy company ads on the teevee machine and from the conservative media entertainment complex now is it",

in treating substance abuse his critique on the institute of medicines latest report substance use disorders in the us armed forces in its latest report entitled substance use disorders in the us armed forces the institute of medicine tells us mostly what we already know the military has a drinking problem a growing painkiller problem and outdated recovery options for those with substance abuse troubles the report goes so far as to decree that alcohol and drug use in the armed forces represents a public health crisis barriers inherent to the military that limit access to treatment for substance abuse include a lack of availability of rehabilitation services gaps in tricare coverage stigma fear of negative consequences and lack of confidential services in 2008 according to the report 47 of active duty service members engaged in binge drinking and 11 reported misusing prescription drugs these figures are staggering but consider this thanks to a prevailing attitude of keepyourpersonalproblemstoyourself in the military combined with the fear that an honest response on an anonymous survey would somehow be attributed to a particular individual there is a significant bias for troops to underreport their risky behaviors like drinking and drugging simply put the actual statistics are probably much worse than reported substance use and abuse is often borne of war dating back to the civil war and beyond soldiers that return from combat are particularly vulnerable to seeking refuge from a bottle whether its full of whiskey or hydrocodone pills turning to the bottle for relief can be a natural response to allay the stress anxiety shame and guilt brought home from war after 11 years of combat along two fronts our military is overdeployed overtired and overstressed an estimated 20 of our returning veterans come home from iraq and afghanistan with posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd 40 of these warriors with ptsd are prescribed both painkillers and benzodiazepines addictive antianxiety medication by military and va doctors – its no surprise then that substance use and abuse is becoming a bigger and bigger problem within the military soldiers sailors and marines by and large arent going to drug dealers to buy illegal drugs instead they are going to their military doctors to receive legal yet potent drugs oftentimes these doctors are quick to write prescriptions for powerful narcotics regardless of the medications dangerous side effects because they feel obligated to lessen their suffering patients misery in 2009 alone military physicians wrote nearly 38 million prescriptions for pain medication which equates to more than 25 prescriptions per active duty service member the report provides recommendations for dealing with the growing substance abuse problem within the military one particular recommendation sounds promising health care professionals at all levels need training in recognizing worrisome patterns of substance abuse and misuse and clear guidelines for referring patients to specialists such as pain management experts and mental health providers although its hard to believe many general practitioner physicians that write prescriptions for narcotic pain meds are not well versed in the side effects and hyperaddictive qualities of these medications subsequently without proper training the very doctors that prescribe these powerful medications can miss clear signals that their patients are becoming addicted other recommendations i believe are unlikely to succeed the armed forces should enforce regulations on underage drinking reduce the number of outlets that sell alcohol on bases and limit their hours of operation limiting the amount and availability of alcohol on military bases will be about as effective at tempering alcohol intake as mayor bloombergs campaign against large sodas in new york city will be at keeping people from getting fat if people are thirsty for booze or for soda they will find a way to indulge themselves regardless of edicts that limit the supply of their fix thankfully the experts agree that substance abuse does not happen in a vacuum and is more often than not experienced alongside ptsd andor depression since these afflictions tend to occur together they should be treated concurrently as well according to the report the emerging model of care relies on multidisciplinary treatment teams with carefully prescribed roles and training unfortunately the military is lacking in joint ptsdsubstance abuse rehabilitation options the treatments are generally either for ptsd or for addiction but not for both the need for veterans healing initiative vhi and the dualdiagnosis treatment centers they provide has never been greater vhi offers confidential dualdiagnosis treatment for ptsd and substance abuse that can be free of charge to veterans from any conflict – within a safe and friendly environment veterans are able to finally take charge of their problems and find serenity in their lives vhis model of care can be the solution but only after military leaders begin encouraging their troops to freely seek the help they need without fear of reprisal only then may we begin to chip away at the relentless stigma that prevents many of our service members from getting the ptsd and substance abuse help they so desperately need its time we did right by our service members and give them the treatment and respect they deserve – as churchill once said the era of procrastination of halfmeasures of soothing and baffling expedients of delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences talk is cheap lets commit to seeing these improvements through our soldiers sailors and marines deserve better",

you better believe him because he believes in violence by god and it was just a few week ago he said there is a value in spiritual violence and it is time that you considered the role that you are playing or not playing and whether or not its time for you to become more aggressive in your beliefs so with the appropriate level of fear in your heart for both crazed preacher and illtempered deity

jesus is returning yes hallelujah jesus is finally coming back to earth to clean up his mess the bible says that whenever we approach the coming of the lord jesus christthat there would be strange weather patterns jesus said this in matthew the twentyfifth chapter he also said there would be false prophets take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many he said that in matthew too just sayin so we have a decision to make do we believe what an environmentalist group says and choose to live in a world where were attempting to make everything as clean in the air as possible or do we believe what the bible says that these things were going to happen and that rather than try to clean up all of the air and solve all of the problems of the world by eliminating factories we should start to tell people about jesus christ who is to return well first of all nobody said anything about eliminating all the factories that would be pretty stupid also impractical since factories produce things we all need in our modern technological society hell we need factories to make wind turbines and water turbines and solar panels and other green technologies to combat climate change or as hagee would put it i suppose to combat jesus return turn those wind turbines on him men thats it look matthew if you are going for a straw man argument at least come up with something better than that and look the vicar of christ himself pope francis has just said safeguard creation because if we destroy creation creation will destroy us never forget this the message is pretty clear we have to protect the environment that we are biblically obligated to do so and that to fail in that charge is to face destruction not by the mighty hand of god flattening our puny selves but at the hands of the climate itself this is cause and effect or maybe hagee didnt watch the matrix i bet the merovingian could have drilled the concept into him pope francis said in very unequivocal terms creation is not a property which we can rule over at will or even less is the property of only a few creation is a gift it is a wonderful gift that god has given us so that we care for it and we use it for the benefit of all always with great respect and gratitude but when we exploit creation we destroy the sign of gods love for us in destroying creation we are saying to god i dont like it this is not goodso what do you like i like myself – here this is sin do you see the pope gets it believe in gods or not the pope sees how this whole environmental thing works and in the end it doesnt matter why he believes we must care for the environment but that he does i can live with the whole god says this god says that thing because the inquisitors arent dropping by my house to put me to question and to make sure im recycling there is no earthly reason – for that matter no heavenly reason – to reject the reality of climate change matthew hagee is not out anything if he admits that human effect on the climate has been deleterious in the extreme the evidence is all around us to insist the bible says something it doesnt say while the waters lap around your neck makes no sense at all or maybe it says somewhere in hagees bible that jesus return will be accompanied by water rising up to his neck who knows the fact is climate change deniers like hagee are corporate tools determined to destroy our earth extracting everything of worth from its depths and proving once and for all that it is their sincere belief that humans have less worth than

russell and masten district councilman demone smith both voted for darius pridgen pastor of true bethel baptist church who had narrowly won the endorsement of the ellicott district democratic committee members in the past that endorsement has all but sealed the common council vote too but not this time the fivemember majority were determined not to choose a candidate closely allied with mayor byron brown smith used the occasion of fridays floor vote to rail loudly and at length against the tyranny of the fivemember majority as council president dave franczyk pounded his gavel and insisted that smith was out of order—an exchange that is becoming so common between the two men as to lose its ability to disturb the chambers customary soporific proceedings more interesting sorry demone was the rant unleashed by state senator antoine thompson on facebook in response to hayness selection the common council and the democratic party not doing rev darius pridgen for the ellicott district is slap in the face im so disgusted as hard as pridgen works and played by the rules and he gets kicked in the butt by the council hopefully pridgen will run in september you have my supportthey r on a power trip on the common council and they must be stopped in voting in haynes the council majority won a battle in their continuing standoff with the mayor but the mayor and his political organization grassroots won too pridgen is reported to be so angered by the councils dismissal of his candidacy that he is determined to run for the office in this falls special election

americans have a very strange way of doing things when it comes to celebrating important historical events that appear on our calendars on days like martin luther king day we take the day off rather than focus our energy on appreciating and rededicating ourselves to his clarion call for action meanwhile on days when we should be surrounding ourselves with family friends and community like thanksgiving day we are being told to get out and shop using his wit charm incredible intellect and vision for a better world martin luther king jr would undoubtedly have something to say about the way modern america approaches its holidays our nations failure to make much progress when it comes to martin luther kings broader dream for our country and our world is one of our societys greatest failures a common theme here at wait what has been our states failure to address the real challenges to universal educational achievement the corporate education reform industry be damned poverty language barriers and the failure to provide sufficient services to students with special needs are the true factors that limit student achievement when speaking last week with a fellow public education advocate about the continued segregation of our schools in connecticut the inequitable distribution of educational resources and the colossal waste of time and money associated with the standardized testing frenzy they sent me a copy of school paper written by noah schaffer a thirteen year old student who lives here in connecticut noah wrote first of all martin luther king jrs dream did not come true because there are many examples of racism and segregation in everyday life some will argue that african americans are not struggling financially as they were at the time of the civil rights movement however the unemployment rate for african americans was at 134 in 2013 this is exactly double the amount of the caucasian unemployment rate which was at 64 in 2013 this shows that african americans are still struggling when it comes to finance even 51 years after dr kings speech some people may argue that african americans are now welcome into schools and that schools are less segregated however studies have shown that public schools are more segregated now than they were 40 years ago only a decade after the march on washington noahs understanding that martin luther kings dream for america was broad and deep and our failure to make much progress in achieving that dream is destroying our society i was reminded that we would all do well to use marin luther king day to stop and listen learn and rededicate ourselves to kings call to action and the unfinished task that faces each and every one of us to that end here are some of the speeches letters and quotes that should be mandatory reading for every citizen in preparation of the holiday we call martin luther king jr day letter to coretta his future wife on july 18 1952 i imagine you already know that i am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic and yet i am not so opposed to capitalism that i have failed to see its relative merits it started out with a noble and high motive to block the trade monopolies of nobles but like most human systems it falls victim to the very thing it was revolting against so today capitalism has outlived its usefulness it has brought about a system that takes necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes i have a dream speech at the march on washington for freedom and jobs on august 28 1963 httpwwwamericanrhetoriccomspeechesmlkihaveadreamhtm we have also come to this hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now this is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism now is the time to make real the promises of democracy now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood now is the time to make justice a reality for all of gods children let us not wallow in the valley of despair i say to you today my friends and so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow i still have a dream it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal i have a dream that one day on the red hills of georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood i have a dream that one day even the state of mississippi a state sweltering with the heat of injustice sweltering with the heat of oppression will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character i have a dream today the drum major instinct february 4 1968 httpmlkkpp01stanfordeduindexphpencyclopediadocumentsentrydocthedrummajorinstinct if any of you are around when i have to meet my day i dont want a long funeral and if you get somebody to deliver the eulogy tell them not to talk too long yes and every now and then i wonder what i want them to say tell them not to mention that i have a nobel peace prize—that isnt important tell them not to mention that i have three or four hundred other awards—thats not important tell them not to mention where i went to school yes id like somebody to mention that day that martin luther king jr tried to give his life serving others yes id like for somebody to say that day that martin luther king jr tried to love somebody i want you to say that day that i tried to be right on the war question amen i want you to be able to say that day that i did try to feed the hungry yes and i want you to be able to say that day that i did try in my life to clothe those who were naked yes i want you to say on that day that i did try in my life to visit those who were in prison lord i want you to say that i tried to love and serve humanity yes yes if you want to say that i was a drum major say that i was a drum major for justice amen say that i was a drum major for peace yes i was a drum major for righteousness and all of the other shallow things will not matter yes i wont have any money to leave behind i wont have the fine and luxurious things of life to leave behind but i just want to leave a committed life behind amen and thats all i want to say if i can help somebody as i pass along if i can cheer somebody with a word or song if i can show somebody hes traveling wrong then my living will not be in vain if i can do my duty as a christian ought if i can bring salvation to a world once wrought if i can spread the message as the master taught then my living will not be in vain yes jesus i want to be on your right or your left side yes not for any selfish reason i want to be on your right or

new world methodist student leadership conference address in lincoln nebraska in 1964 httpwwwamericanrhetoriccomspeechesmlkmethodistyouthconferencehtm let me say secondly that we have a christian responsibility in this racial crisis in this revolution to reaffirm the essential immorality of racial segregation now over the last few years we have had many important legal battles and all of these battles of been for the purpose of establishing the constitutionality of integration and the unconstitutionality of segregation it was very important to have these legal battles very important to have the supreme court standing up in 1954 saying that separate facilities are inherently unequal — that the old plessy doctrine of 1896 must go and that to segregate a child on the basis of his race is to not — to deny that child equal protection of the law nobel peace prize acceptance speech in oslo norway on december 10 1964 httpwwwnobelprizeorgmediaplayerindexphpid1853 civilization and violence are antithetical concepts nonviolence is not sterile passivity but a powerful moral force which makes for social transformation sooner or later all the peoples of the world will have to discover a way to live together in peace and thereby transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood i refuse to accept despair as a final response to the ambiguities of history i refuse to accept the idea that man is mere flotsam and jetsam in the river of life unable to influence the unfolding events which surround him i refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to

here and there were those who said that we would get here only over their dead bodies but all the world today knows that we are here and that we are standing before the forces of power in the state of

baptist church in atlanta on july 4 1965 httpmlkkpp01stanfordeduindexphpencyclopediadocumentsentrydoctheamericandream about two years ago now i stood with many of you who stood there in person and all of you who were there in spirit before the lincoln memorial in washington as i came to the end of my speech there i tried to tell the nation about a dream i had i must confess to you this morning that since that sweltering august afternoon in 1963 my dream has often turned into a nightmare ive seen my dream shattered as ive walked the streets of chicago and see negroes young men and women with a sense of utter hopelessness because they cant find any jobs ive seen my dream shattered as ive been through appalachia and ive seen my white brothers along with negroes living in poverty and im concerned about white poverty as much as im concerned about negro poverty a time to break the silence at riverside church in new york on april 4 1967 httpwwwamericanrhetoriccomspeechesmlkatimetobreaksilencehtm a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death we are taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them 8000 miles away to guarantee liberties in southeast asia which they had not found in southwest georgia and east harlem so we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching negro and white boys on tv screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools where do we go from here chaos or community kings last book published in 1967 white americans must recognize that justice for black people can not be achieved without radical changes in the structure of our society the comfortable entrenched the privileged can not continue to tremble at the prospect of change of the status quo this is a multiracial nation where all groups are dependent on each other there is no separate white path to power and fulfillment short of social disaster that does not share power with black aspirations for freedom and human dignity ive been to the mountain top in memphis on april 3 1968 httpwwwamericanrhetoriccomspeechesmlkivebeentothemountaintophtm something is happening in our world the masses of people are rising up and wherever they are assembled today whether they are in johannesburg south africa nairobi kenya accra ghana new york city atlanta georgia jackson mississippi or memphis tennessee — the cry is always the same we want to be free now we are poor people individually we are poor when you compare us with white society in america we are poor never stop and forget that collectively — that means all of us together — collectively we are richer than all the nations of the world with the exception of nine did you ever think about that weve got some difficult days ahead but it really doesnt matter with me now because ive been to the mountaintop and i dont mind like anybody i would like to live a long life longevity has its place but im not concerned about that now i just want to do gods will and hes allowed me to go up to the mountain and ive looked over and ive seen the promised land i may not get there with you but i want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land and so im happy

2014 photo secretary of state john kerry indicated that a reports findings on the rate of climate change would influence foreign policy credit jim lo scalzoeuropean pressphoto agency washington — the accelerating rate of climate change poses a severe risk to national security and acts as a catalyst for global political conflict a report published tuesday by a leading governmentfunded military research organization concluded the cna corporation military advisory board found that climate changeinduced drought in the middle east and africa is leading to conflicts over food and water and escalating longstanding regional and ethnic tensions into violent clashes the report also found that rising sea levels are putting people and food supplies in vulnerable coastal regions like eastern india bangladesh and the mekong delta in vietnam at risk and could lead to a new wave of refugees in addition the report predicted that an increase in catastrophic weather events around the world will create more demand for american troops even as flooding and extreme weather events at home could damage naval ports and military bases in an interview secretary of state john kerry signaled that the reports findings would influence american foreign policy tribes are killing each other over water today mr kerry said think of what happens if you have massive dislocation or the drying up of the waters of the nile of the major rivers in china and india the intelligence community takes it seriously and its translated into action mr kerry who plans to deliver a major speech this summer on the links between climate change and national security said his remarks would also be aimed at building political support for president obamas climate change agenda including a new regulation to cut pollution from coalfired power plants that the administration will introduce in june were going to try to lay out to people legitimate options for action that are not bankbreaking or negative mr kerry said pentagon officials said the report would affect military policy the department certainly agrees that climate change is having an impact on national security whether by increasing global instability by opening the arctic or by increasing sea level and storm surge near our coastal installations john conger the pentagons deputy under secretary of defense for installations and environment said in a statement we are actively integrating climate considerations across the full spectrum of our activities to ensure a ready and resilient force the report on tuesday follows a recent string of scientific studies that warn that the effects of climate change are already occurring and that flooding droughts extreme storms food and water shortages and damage to infrastructure will occur in the near future in march the pentagons quadrennial defense review the agencys main public document describing the current doctrine of the united states military drew a direct link between the effects of global warming — like rising sea levels and extreme weather patterns — and terrorism these effects are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty environmental degradation political instability and social tensions — conditions that can enable terrorist activity and other forms of violence the review said tuesdays report is an update of a report by the centers military advisory board in 2007 the first major study to draw the link between climate change and national security the reports authors said the biggest change in the seven years between the two studies was the increase in scientific certainty about global warming and of the link between global warming and security disruptions the 2007 report also described climate change as a threat multiplier or a problem that could enhance or contribute to already existing causes of global disruption the 2014 report updates that language calling climate change a catalyst for conflict — a phrase intentionally chosen the reports authors said to signal that climate change is an active driving force in starting conflict in the past the thinking was that climate change multiplied the significance of a situation said gen charles f wald who contributed to both reports and is retired from the air force now were saying its going to be a direct cause of instability the most recent scientific reports on climate change warn that increasing drought in africa is now turning arable land to desert the national security reports authors conclude that the slow but steady expansion of the sahara through mali which is killing crops and leaving farmers starving may have been a contributing force in the jihadist uprising in that african country in 2012 since then al qaeda in the islamic maghreb has seized control of northern mali and remains in conflict with the malian government the report warns that rising sea levels in the united states imperil many of the navys coastal installations last week the white house released a national climate assessment report citing norfolk va as one of the cities most vulnerable to damage by rising sea levels norfolk is home to the worlds largest naval base as well as a nuclear submarine construction yard — all of which are vulnerable to destruction by rising sea levels found in tuesdays report norfolk is so big its so important to the navy its important to virginia for jobs and it would go general wald said a scientific report released this week found that global warming has contributed to the melting of a large section of a west antarctica ice sheet which could lead to a rise in sea level of 10 feet or more senator james m inhofe of oklahoma the ranking republican on the senate armed services committee and a vocal skeptic of the established science that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global warming scoffed at the idea that climate change is linked to national security threats there is no one in more pursuit of publicity than a retired military officer he said of the reports authors i look back wistfully at the days of the cold war now you have people who are mentally imbalanced with the ability to deploy a nuclear weapon for anyone to say that any type of global warming is anywhere close to the threat that we have with crazy people running around with nuclear weapons it shows how desperate they are to get the public to buy this rear adm david titley a coauthor of the report and a meteorologist who is retired from the navy said political opposition would not extinguish what he called the

building steam of justice stuck on the rails in its path lumbered americas convoy of racial injustices standing proud at the junction black americans laid tracks for their future it was 1963 and history was accelerating before our eyes it was accelerating after a long slow painful reign of racism and fomenting response so that by 1963 we reached this crossroads—this tipping point and there was a sudden expansion of race into our national consciousness the events of the year spilled across the land dynamically and tragically in january president kennedy requests new civil rights legislation in april the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc and the southern christian leadership conference sclc mount antisegregation demonstrations in birmingham alabama live on national tv for the first time dr martin luther king jr is arrested and writes his letter from birmingham jail and mailman william moore marches for racial justice and is murdered for his efforts may brings mass marches kelly ingram park the childrens crusade and sheriff bull connors dog and firehose response kennedy deploys 3000 troops to birmingham protestors in durham greensboro jackson danville st augustine savannah and orangeburg sit in sing out march and picket for equality governor george wallace blocks the university of alabama door promising segregation today tomorrow and forever until kennedy forces the admission of two black students kennedy gives a belated but bold civil rights speech are we to say to the world that this is a land of the free except for negroes followed in four hours by the murder of naacp mississippi field secretary medgar evers shot in the back in front of his home attorney general bobby kennedy testifies on the civil rights act james meredith graduates from the university of mississippi in august 250000 march on washington and dr king dreams in september klansmen bomb birminghams sixteenth street baptist church killing four little girls in october 200000 chicago students boycott school for freedom day in november president kennedy is assassinated malcolm x says the chickens came home to roost president johnson calls for passage of the civil rights bill no eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedys memory congress finally relents and schedules hearings in 1964 today fifty years down the tracks civil rights and voting rights acts have been passed the gap between the white and black poverty rates is half what it was then and a black man is in the white house but progress on civil rights since slavery has been dialectical almost hegelian in its slow twostepsforwardoneback pace king studied hegel en route to his doctorate the movements thesis antithesis and synthesis are real events with real people and real costs each paring of progress and plight has left suffering and a parade of martyrs in its path the high of 1963 the march on washington was followed days later by the sickening low of birminghams bomb on august 28 the booming baritone of the king of love lifted the nation adlibbing a miraculous jazzpoem from isaiah jeremiah amos psalms the gettysburg address shakespeare black spirituals the declaration of independence and samuel francis smiths my country tis of thee sung stunningly by marian anderson on that very spot easter sunday twentyfour years before less a speech than a song a physicalization of love it gave the movement a musical score born of suffering heart church theater and grit but on september 15 a klan bomb killed denise mcnair cynthia wesley carole robertson and addie mae collins at the sixteenth street baptist church the mornings sermon had been the love that forgives the klansman timed the bombing for the churchs annual youth sunday the physicalization of hate the reverend connie lynch said if theres four less niggers tonight then i say good for whoever planted the bomb in 1964 the civil rights act illegitimatized segregation in public accommodations even a boy born in stonewall texas then suddenly our president told us their cause must be our cause too because it is not just negroes but really it is all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice and we shall overcome words that moved king to tears but there were also the freedom summer tragedies the mississippi summer project to register black voters faced harassment from white supremacists locals and police freedom school buildings and the volunteers homes were targets thirtyseven black churches and thirty black homes and businesses were firebombed or burned more than 1000 black and white volunteers were arrested at least eighty were beaten by white mobs or police and three young civil rights workers—james chaney andrew goodman and michael schwerner—were murdered terrorism homegrown and bred in 1965 king leading a march from selma to montgomery alabama said how long not long and the voting rights act passed but malcolm x was murdered and the watts riot left thirtyfour more dead in 1966 james meredith was shot during the march against fear from memphis tennessee to jackson mississippi mounted to encourage black voting after passage of the voting rights act ten days later while completing the march meredith began stokely carmichael coined the phrase black power any white man in this country knows about power he knows what white power is and he ought to know what black power is huey newton and bobby seale formed the black panther party in oakland in 1967 thurgood marshall became the first black supreme court justice at the arena stage also in our nations capital a black boxer kissed his white wife and the celebrated play scandalized audiences maybe more than jack johnson had in 1910 in natchez mississippi local naacp treasurer wharlest jackson just promoted in his job to a position previously reserved for whites only was murdered by a car bomb across the country seventy separate riots blazed then 1968 april 4 the king of love as nina simone sang was dead murdered on the balcony at the lorraine motel the day after he went to the mountaintop more riots across the land—125 by weeks end chicagos was the biggest our apostle of nonviolence had been assassinated and chicagos mayor daley ordered his police to shoot to kill then bobby how long not long because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice but where was the justice it was on the supreme court in the person of mr justice marshall it was in the 1968 civil rights act banning housing discrimination it was at that summers olympics where tommie smith and john carlos raised blackgloved fists it was on capitol hill where shirley chisholm became the first black woman elected to congress it was even on television where diahann carroll became the first black actress to star in her own series and nichelle nichols and william shatner shared the first interracial kiss on american television it is in the legacy left to us by the leaders of 1963 known and unknown who by sheer force of courage and will bent the long slow arc of the moral universe further toward justice but in 1968 there was cause to wonder how far we had really come as a nation four straight summers of violence and a casualty list long and deep and today fifty years out from the crossroads of 1963 cause for concern continues there is justice in the reelection of our fortyfourth president but there is also the supreme court decision in shelby county v holder eviscerating the 1965 voting rights act eightyfive percent of black and latino households have a net worth below the median for white households only 45 percent of the black population own a home compared with 70 percent of the white population black americans constitute nearly 1 million of the 23 million incarcerated segregation prevails in the university of alabamas greek system perpetuating wallaces legacy obamacares effort to extend health coverage to millions will miss twothirds of the people it was designed to help poor black families and single mothers without insurance because they live in red states that have refused to participate in the expansion of medicaid and even our fortyfourth president can not cross the street without car doors locking there was a time in america when race ran the table maybe now at the 100yard line from the emancipation proclamation and fifty yards out from 1963 at least that is no longer true it can even be said that it is widely viewed as unamerican to be discriminatory but as king wrote from jail black people in this country have waited more than 340 years for our constitutional and god given rights now it is 400 years and yet our country seems to feel the entrenched effects of four centuries of majority privilege and minority oppression have been magically eradicated perhaps by the election of a black president the racism virus has mutated ever cleverer at escaping detection a recent tufts universityharvard business school study found whites believe that they have replaced blacks as the primary victims of racial discrimination in contemporary america reality tells us differently showing black unemployment twice that of white unemployment black men six times more likely to be incarcerated than white men 40 percent of white americans surrounded by friends of their own race and schools more segregated than they were in the late 1960s malcom x said if you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches there is no progress if you pull it all the way out that is not progress the progress is healing the wound that the blow made and they havent even begun to pull the knife out much less trying to heal the wound they wont even admit the knife is there malcolm x was in good company aristotle knew 2000 years ago that treating unequals equally is not equality distributive justice demands we treat equals equally and unequals unequally on august 28 1963 king listened—he listened to history to the crowd to mahalia jackson who broke into his speech saying tell em about the dream martin he heard the truth and acted on conscience he cast aside his text grabbed the lectern shed fear for courage went with his heart and told us of his dream he was the musician of a movement that bent the arc of the moral universe dramatically toward justice and we are in his and its debt fifty years later on august 28 2013 barack obama told another crowd gathered on that same mall stretching out from the lincoln memorial the arc of the moral universe may bend toward justice but it doesnt bend on its own to secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance it requires vigilance and it requires a moral courage and commitment that now seem in short supply looking back through the gauzy patina of history we see the glory but dont feel the gritty sweatstained valor of then these were warriors for justice five months before the march king violated an injunction forbidding him to pray sing or march in public in birmingham and led a march from the same sixteenth street baptist church bombed six months later he had been advised—by his lawyer counselors even his father—not to march to comply with the order and go home he replied that though there might be no money for bail i have to make a faith act he wrote his letter from jail there comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over five months later he told the nation we have also come to this hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now the boy from sweet auburn born michael king jr his father changed their names to martin luther king sr and jr when he was five and bequeathed an innate moral imagination had summoned the great moral courage to march speak live and die for the realization of a dream fifty years later the black preachers words from that white podium in lincolns shadow still roll down our cheeks but we need to do more than cry we need to find the moral courage he and malcolm x and many others taught us a century after emancipation and half a century after the civil rights movement many sacrifices seem to have been in vain and too much of the dream remains unfulfilled john kennedy said americans do things not because they are easy but because they are hard he was talking about going to the moon but his words surely apply to reaching the promised land on earth the arc of the universe over the last fifty years shows we have come far down the tracks but we have yet to do all the hard work to requite the sacrament these three martyred men and so many others made of their lives and to see the wounds finally healed and the dream finally realized",

            "body": "genesis archives climategaga how do you talk about climate change god and stewardship to graduating high school students to not lecture them freak them out or bore them to tears carefully and thoughtfully last night i was the featured speaker for a baccalaureate ceremony at st cecilias church recognizing our graduating high school seniors what follows is my talk this message is about gifts responsibility and hope from luke 1227 notice how the flowers grow they do not toil or spin but i tell you not even solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of them not even solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of them hmmmm think about that line when i read that i think how beautiful nature is and that you cant replicate it we can take photos of nature paint nature record the sounds of nature but when it comes right down to it we cant recreate natures magnificence and from timothy 412 do not let anyone look down on you because you are young but be an example for the believers be an example for the believers well get back to that powerful line later and then we have these lines from genesis after god had created the heavens and earth the atmosphere and oceans animals and fishes trees plants and livestock and humans god saw all that he had made and it was very good and there was evening and there was morning and god rested on the seventh day greatly pleased with all he had created this beautiful planet is a gift lets not forget that were taught as children to take good care of gifts received from others but sometimes we make mistakes sometimes we break the rules i remember as a nineyear old being scolded by my mother for destroying a beautiful glass watch given to me by my aunt libby aunt libby was my dads older sister i loved aunt libby but my curiosity for how the watch operated was too great to overcome and try as i may to carefully unlock its inner contents it was only when i took a hammer to the glass cover that i could peer inside at the watchs shiny metallic interior back in the old days there were no electric watches nearly everything was spring powered my actions satisfied my immediate desire but rendered the watch useless it was with shame i told my aunt what happened to the watch when she asked how i liked the gift shed given me she smiled and nodded though her eyes showed disappointment have you ever had a gift that you damaged perhaps a toy you took apart or something you were careless with a bicycle left outside in the rain a cell phone with a screen broken from being dropped one too many times we receive so many gifts in our lives and sometimes we fail to care for them many things we dont even realize are gifts like this beautiful planet we live on i often wonder how well we are caring for planet earth and would god be pleased pope francis recently spoke about climate change to a huge crowd in rome he said safeguard creation because if we destroy creation creation will destroy us never forget this our pope continued creation is not a property which we can rule over at will or even less is the property of only a few creation is a gift it is a wonderful gift that god has given us so that we care for it and we use it for the benefit of all always with great respect and gratitude god gave us this beautiful beautiful planet as a gift to care for and we have a responsibility to care for that gift now and for generations to come you have a responsibility to care for our planet i have a responsibility to care for our planet we all have a responsibility to care for the planet to speak up when others threaten to harm it and its not always easy to do the right thing to go against the flow you are graduating from high school congratulations your elementary school days are long gone some of you will go off to college others the military and still others to work regardless of your path this chapter of your life is closing you are high school graduates young adults and with graduation comes new responsibilities one of which is to care for the earth—a beautiful beautiful gift from god in case we havent noticed the earth needs some serious loving our climate is changing from burning too much oil coal and natural gas we consume more than we should and we dont always think how our lifestyles affect the earth every thing we do has an impact on this planet the food we eat the way we commute to work or school how we power and heat our homes the people we elect to lead us when you stop and think about it every choice we make impacts the environment to some degree im concerned about the dire predictions for our planets future if we fail to act soon and aggressively 978 of climate scientists say humans are altering the earths climate in fact scientists now refer to the present as the anthropocene a geologic period during which human activity has been the dominant influence on climate and the environment carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have increased over 50 in the past 150 years sea level is rising the arctic ice sheet is melting our weather is more extreme and many species of living organisms are threatened with extinction im not here to depress you but to remind you that gods gift the earth needs to be taken care of now not later a few years ago i felt a call to use my gifts to help others understand climate change perhaps that was gods plan for me all along to study science as a graduate student and work as an oceanographer and later in my career an educator my concerns for the future planet your generation inherits and the generations that follow motivated me to take action i want future generations to experience the beauty of nature as i have lush green forests crisp autumn days trout surfacing on the schroon river the flitter of a hummingbird drawing nectar from flowers or the fresh powder of a new snow these are things worth saving my stewardship is to present the facts about climate change to general audiences as a climate reality leader by helping people understand what climate change is and how the worstcase scenarios can be prevented i am taking responsibility for my part in preserving gods beautiful creation i encourage you to consider how you can be a good steward to the earth how you can fight climate change how you can help educate others each of you has special and unique gifts and talents use them to make a difference i encourage you to look at this challenge with hopefulness and resolution to remember gods creation can heal itself with proper care and attention and to know you are connected to something bigger god is present he has your back returning to luke 412 do not let anyone look down on you because you are young but be an example for the believers you can be the example to others so we can stop climate change make our air and waters cleaner and restore the earths beauty peace like this like loading",

evidence to the contrary i maintain that we might not be as bad off as it seems this isnt an exercise in wideeyed optimism strategic denial or the power of positive thinking rather it is reflective of what i take as an inexorable impulse in nature — and thus within humankind as part of its workings — toward productive sustainable and ultimately just relations at all points in the web in short i want to suggest that life is good and that it matters what is the alternative that we are part of some predestined machinery of death and decay bent on nothing except ushering in our own demise seriously the narrative of a selffulfilling apocalypse is merely another way of keeping us in fear and giving our innate power over to the immanence of security and order — whether its edicts are delivered to us by fiat or artifice now this is not intended to justify any of the calamities we have wrought in the modern era in fact precisely the opposite the belief in a just universe is not a static passive principle but one that must be struggled for and actively promoted at all levels of our lives we dont get to relax and bask in the goodness of creation nor to indulge ourselves in the hedonism of abdication instead we need to wake up every day and be the architects of the world we desire to inhabit these teachings have been reflected to us myriad times throughout history and we likely know the names of many of the oftentimes martyred proponents as peace pilgrim once said the only thing new about any of this would be actually doing it we can make the choice at every turn to humanize our relations with one another and to reorient our roles within the balance of nature manmade law as thoreau argued may turn us into the agents of injustice but perhaps there are even higher principles to be found all around us and within ourselves alike martin luther king jr summoned this potential power on many occasions entreating us to consider the active manner in which we might align our intentions with a greater good i know you are asking today how long will it take i come to say to you this afternoon however difficult the moment however frustrating the hour it will not be long because truth crushed to earth will rise again how long not long because no lie can live forever how long not long because you shall reap what you sow how long not long because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice king delivered these words more than once including at the end of the march from selma to montgomery on march 25 1965 he was of course invoking scripture and spiritual teachings in many of his speeches yet we can also discern that the arc of the moral universe is equally an expression of science and politics as much as it is one of theology or philosophy the origins of the phrase actually date to 1853 with the abolitionist minister theodore parker who said i do not pretend to understand the moral universe the arc is a long one my eye reaches but little ways i can not calculate the curve and complete the figure by experience of sight i can divine it by conscience and from what i see i am sure it bends toward justice in this sense the notion can be read as part observation and part intuition simultaneously a projection of reality and a longing for a better world all at once both practical and idealistic this integration of the empirical and the intuitive represents the best of modern thoughts spirit of interconnection by viewing pieces of the whole as mutually reinforcing rather than oppositional king added to this sensibility with his famous insight that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere again indicating the holistic integral nature of moral inquiry another way of thinking about this is conveyed by the notion of traveling full circle which is actually inspired by the physics of the cosmos itself if one was to trace the edge of a small arc and project it out to infinity eventually it would intersect itself at the place of origin indeed even the orbits of planets and stars — which appear elliptical in nature — are actually straightline movements that lead to cyclical motions based on the curvature of space itself from whence we came so we return yet each revolution also brings new insights and challenges interestingly this potent historical phrase referencing the moral arc has been described as barack obamas favorite quotation on april 4 2008 the 40th anniversary of kings assassination thensenator obama declared dr king once said that the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice it bends towards justice but here is the thing it does not bend on its own it bends because each of us in our own ways put our hand on that arc and we bend it in the direction of justice and in june of 2009 president obama again invoked the phrase in support of the universal rights to assembly and free speech being exercised by demonstrators in iran so now what obama seemingly gets it at least rhetorically yet still we find ourselves steadily descending into moral oblivion rather than ascending on the arc of justice in a recent article asking what happened to obama drew westen eloquently spells out the conundrum when dr king spoke of the great arc bending toward justice he did not mean that we should wait for it to bend he exhorted others to put their full weight behind it and he gave his life speaking with a voice that cut through the blistering force of water cannons and the gnashing teeth of police dogs but the arc of history does not bend toward justice through capitulation cast as compromise it does not bend when 400 people control more of the wealth than 150 million of their fellow americans it does not bend when the average middleclass family has seen its income stagnate over the last 30 years while the richest 1 percent has seen its income rise astronomically it does not bend when we cut the fixed incomes of our parents and grandparents so hedge fund managers can keep their 15 percent tax rates it does not bend when only one side in negotiations between workers and their bosses is allowed representation and it does not bend when as political scientists have shown it is not public opinion but the opinions of the wealthy that predict the votes of the senate the arc of history can bend only so far before it breaks westens stark prose is an effective statement of the tenor of these angstridden times yet while it rightly reflects the proactive sense in which we must be participants in destiny rather than mere observers it also makes a strategic miscalculation in assuming that the force of the entrenched powers that be can somehow use economic coercion and political chicanery to forestall the advance of justice in the long run of human andor natural affairs king and parker before him did not promise immediate returns on our activist investment in the service of righteousness indeed things didnt get to be this way overnight and it will take a long time — even an eternity perhaps — to set it right again in this sense justice is asymptotic something to be forever and vigilantly pursued without regard for its ultimate realization still as we continue to work toward it and increasingly approach its arc we can see it begin to infuse our relationships with one another and with the balance of existence as a whole part of the task is to relieve ourselves of the unattainable burden of fixing it all or making some sort of heaven on earth focusing instead on the small steps we can take often thanklessly at each moment in our lives being a good person — or a good people for that matter — isnt about being perfect and never doing wrong such a quest for moral certitude especially in a fully wired postmodern world is pragmatically impossible and thoroughly immobilizing rather the signs of goodness are more about what we make of our missteps whether we regret them appropriately and strive to learn their lessons as we forge ahead in this manner the essence of morality isnt about absolutism or punishment for inevitable letdowns but more so about the direction in which we are moving in fact we might say that this sense of directionality is the arc of justice it proceeds regardless as a function of the unity in diversity inherent in the cosmos with or without our willing engagement the question before us is whether we want to be part of it or instead remain on a course toward selfimposed annihilation we can help shape the moral arc by promoting economic fairness environmental sustainability and nonviolence through our efforts toward ending warfare rejecting consumerism and stabilizing the biosphere and by the virtue of teaching ourselves and our children to abandon hatred embrace nonmonetary values and work in concert with others to produce both sustenance and justice in our communities this is the nascent arc now coming into view calling upon us to help imagine and implement it the journey may be long and the destination unfixed but i have no doubt that we will get there someday indeed by embarking on the enterprise at all we may have already arrived",

            "body": "the frequencies a poem some values of landscape and weather in the frequencies noah eli gordon disconnects the flat utilitarian sentence of normal discourse from any sense of normality if google is the new typewriter thats what my guess is we need to explore this simultaneously bright and dull instrument like the modernists explored the typewriter everything everyone throws into the ether is now getting archived the collagist can play cornell or darger with greater immediate access cutandpasting the linguistics of the market and chatroom and business proposal and usa patriot act into his or her oracles gordon is of the first wave of what is sure to be a sea of poets testing the um jagged banks of language on the internet these banks are evidences of how people actually put their words together gordon is disc jockeying for the everyman station where in classic american fashion the profane gleefully tangles with the lyrical which gordon reminds us is just a few dictionary entries away from lynch 1003 you told me that in the center of every bird there is a tiny radio but your trying on of different voices wont help the notes exit dare i say you werent exactly born with wings at heart im a ham operator whether lips make regret beaks music is irrelevant to a birds desire to touch i dont understand you said its easy enough to move on i was stuck with fundraising duties handling the complaint line the producer handed me a passage from moby dick made me cross out the word whale replace it with our call letters read it over the air i was creaking the broadcast afraid theyd come with torches to oust me from the isolation brought on by excess listening i could always mention the albatross but itd be the obvious out besides even a birdsound is a radio sputtering in white noise enticed more by the bleached pigeon bones on the roof than your lackluster reception i havent met mr gordon but im curious if he has b i r d r a d i o tattooed on his fingers night of the hunter style the words are repeated obsessively compulsively as though they are hardwired into whatever forces conspired to put this collection together telling totems bird radio each could be championed as models for gordons booklength poem which swiftly navigates the currents of now like a bird skittery afloat tuneful in flight while also employing polyvocal harmonies and commentaries as well as static like your old boombox i latched onto the bird and radio images as insights to the poems methods some examples i jotted down culled from throughout the poembook the little cities of the radio fold like mountains into the seduction of order theres poignancy in keeping ones mouth shut in pine needles which also fade some birds flap their wings to keep the air moving i just stare at the clock radio wondering why the numbers dont flip a scratch inside the radio is how many times rome can catch fire is how many fiddles are hidden along the horizon line i keep telling myself the more radios i buy the better my reception my radios been walking with a variable foot maybe im projecting here but i tell it everything everything except i want to be a radio the title says the frequencies a poem i may be overreading to interpret that as the radio a poetics a few more excerpts would it be melodramatic to say an angel took herself apart over the airwaves we were composing the new radio from cutups of edgar allen poes collected prose it may be more difficult than ever to talk about poetry and still get laid if only because its hard to not sound like an academic and no one wants to sleep with academics except their students to me to use someone elses language is to signify that you want to sleep with that person i personally dont want to sound academic not because i want to get laid more often but because i dont want to be somebodys schoolboy gordon has found a way to talk about poetry in the frequencies and still sound like a virile adult its not just the use of radio and bird as possible standins for poetry its the use of usable ordinary syntax we were getting as close to silence as possible saturating the space of no thinking remembering the sound of the radio once removed this is almost the selfromanticism and selfdeception of memoir writing but with the abstract presented as the lifehurdle as the something you can with courage get close to the something that has a space that needs the speakers attention the something that produces characterbuilding memories one could use the same sentence structure and alter the wording to produce a believable excerpt from a gulf war memoir perhaps we were getting as close to the enemy as possible scanning the space of engagement remembering the sound of battles once fought my point is gordon is conscious of not only the cliches of poetic imagery and phrasing but those of rhythm and syntax as well and doesnt settle for the easy victory of mocking the cliches either those who cant subvert instead he works through to a new space those who can resuscitate saturating it with intelligence getting as close to poetry as possible remembering the sounds of poems once believed the frequencies is at times closer to the emails of a brilliant autodidactic gas attendant than to anything that announces itself as poetry that may be why it feels so alive most of the sparks theres a lot of sparks come from watching gordon work on the border between how poets and actual people write instead of condescendingly dropping slang words and such into wellworn poetic structures gordon commits to the structures of common discourse and finds something human and breathless there in some values of landscape and weather peter gizzi achieves the contemporary dream he balances accident and precision shaping trajectories throughout his poems allowing the vectors and volleys of language to shape him it is a book of obstinate lyricism that accounts for the world as it actually is but still insists on finding a type of beauty even if its unfamiliar from the title poem not wanting to disturb an ant i lift my leg to let it carry on its pursuit of whatnot its impressive all this matter crawling marching even achieving an acorn of the instant so this isnt exactly novelty here babysitting the wood grain wanting to step up inside myself courage carrots charity the word says in a notebook to accept the ink of the possible this proves i have dreamed allen grossman has developed a beautiful trope for how poems from different stages of a poets life can interact both with each other and with the poet in all his guises in sweet youth he describes the old and young allen meeting on a stairway exchanging a kiss gizzis book performs a similarly passionate vulnerable and possibly sweetly nostalgic act but theres a lot on his staircase the scottish band belle sebastian jim jarmuschs movie dead man the history of the lyric some dust wallace stevens the poem revival is like a roll call a brief history of the human desire to create beauty amidst chaos and death and other violent orders heres a hefty quote from the poems beginning its good to be dead in america with the movies curtains and drift the muzak in the theater its good to be in a theater waiting for the best years of our lives to begin our first night back were here entertaining a hunch our plane did crash somewhere over the rockies luggage and manuscripts scattered charred fragments attempting to survive the fatal draft to be dead in america at the movies distracted by preview music in dimming lights i never once thought of alfred deller or kathleen ferrier singing kindertotenlieder its good to be lost among pillars of grass i never once thought of my last duchess or the pines of rome isnt it great here just now dying along with azaleas trilliums myrtle viburnums daffodils blue phlox the poem has shaken off italics and distancing quotation marks and allows mahler and ottorino respighi two composers who in tandem seem to conjure ezra pound and browning and hollywood director william wyler the best years of our lives being the years three soldiers and their families lost during world war ii to infect the poem and thus the speaker directly the list of flowers in the above excerpt can also be found in wallace stevens the man on the dump now in the time of spring azaleas trilliums myrtle viburnums daffodils blue phlox between that disgust and this between the things that are on the dump azaleas and so on and those that will be azaleas and so on one feels the purifying change one rejects the trash gizzis technique of allowing stevens into his poem breathes life into both his poem and stevens one could adopt this as a working role for a poet walking around and giving soul kisses to every dead and living thing which is where gizzi seems to alter from stevens by not rejecting the trash one personal riddle i ask myself about a poets work is if her poems are a labyrinth whats the minotaur in the center poet a i answer has an actual minotaur poet b has a bunch of mirrors for a minotaur poet c has a picture from childhood of him embracing his father peter gizzi it seems has a dead or dying person whom he could have saved or whom he could still save or whom he would save if he could or knew how to save or even knew the dead or dying person was there his poems often seem en route to rescue another personal riddle i make what kind of world would it be if one used that poets texts as the blueprint all snow and vixen nothing but the poets backyard gizzis world would likely look familiar and american in its objects but would be charged with strange that is spiritual possibilities for instance the possibility of finding the sufficient verb to breathe life into and to join together all or many of the poems nouns from wind follow the kite tail its party bows and ribbons it will renew your faith in small things a specific word so spoken will do the notes they are everything reconstitute twilight as you enter the song the street the house the shower i think its the combination of craft and possibility that makes gizzis book so full of beautiful writing like the above gizzi jumps from musicianspeak the notes they are everythingreconstitute twilight as you enterthe song and extends the line to a discussion of a you the reader feels invited to enter these lines as the you follows a usual routine coming home cleaning off that takes on a spiritual glow not just from the invocation of song but by the invitation to enter a vaguely familiar but strangely valuable world stevens once wrote after the final no there comes a yesand on that yes the future world depends gizzi appears to have heard the final no and waits the subsequent yes hes

forty years after the clean water act became law the data are clear iowas rivers and streams are still murky the pollution that continues to degrade them has become a case study on the consequences of the most serious flaw in this historic and otherwise effective federal law it does little or nothing to address agricultural pollution an ewg analysis shows that from 2008 to 2011 water quality was rated poor or very poor at 60 percent of the 98 stream segments monitored by the iowa water quality index the index produced by the iowa department of natural resources idnr uses data from a

bea johnson does author of zero waste home the ultimate guide to simplifying your life by reducing your waste though at one point in her life is seemed as impossible to her as it might now to you and me back in 2006 she and her husband and two young sons lived in a 3000squarefoot house in the suburbs of san francisco but they were unhappy with that lifestyle and decided to downsize they got rid of 8090 percent of their belongings including a second car and found a 1400squarefoot home within walking distance of amenities since then bea hasnt looked back every aspect of her lifestyle and household has been tweaked to create as little waste as possible she uses reusable bags and jars for shopping buying most food in bulk almost all of the familys clothes are secondhand and each persons can fit inside a carryon bag making travel easier – and probably more feasible considering that living thriftily has cut down 40 percent on family expenses when the family is gone they rent out their home so its not wasted last summer when bea was in france to launch the french edition of zero waste home she posted daily pictures on instagram of her wearing the same black wraparound skirt tied in different ways for a month the secret bea believes is to reduce the amount of waste brought into the home in the first place her mantra is refuse reduce reuse recyle rot — and even though recycling is important it should only be thought of as a last option here are some tips that she gives for tackling household waste refuse fight junk mail and turn down freebies declutter lighten the load at home use a list when you shop so you bring home less and create less waste to deal with afterwards reuse swap disposables for reusables by using handkerchiefs refillable bottles cloth napkins rags etc avoid grocerystore waste by bringing reusable totes cloth bags for dry bulk items and jars for wet items such as cheese and deli foods recycle know your citys recycling policies but think of it was a last resort question the need and life cycle of your purchases buy primarily in bulk and secondhand but if you must buy new avoid plastic much gets shipped across the world for recycling and ends up in landfill or the ocean rot compost as many things as possible turn your kitchen trash can into a large compost receptacle the bigger it is the more likely you are to use it beas blog has much more

planetary consciousness as a scientific development he also wrote of this noosphere in mystical terms as mankinds quest for closeness with the divine and he sounded prescient notes of warning there is a danger that the elements of the world should refuse to serve the world he wrote in the phenomenon of man published in 1957 what is forming and growing is nothing less than an organic crisis in evolution pope francis sounded a lot like his fellow jesuit at a may 21 general audience creation is a gift he told 50000 people at st peters square that god has given us so that we care for it and we use it for the benefit of all we are custodians of creation not masters of creation the pope continued his sermon would well fit an anthology on conscious evolution a school of thought that bridges science and faith in arguing that humanity has an urgent moral duty for care of the planet i am the master of creation but to carry it forward i will never destroy your gift the pope asserted and this should be our attitude towards creation safeguard creation because if we destroy creation creation will destroy us never forget this franciss remarks came two weeks after cardinal gerhard müller head of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith issued a rebuke of leadership conference of women religious representing most of americas 57000 nuns for their promotion of conscious evolution the lcwr is operating under a vatican mandate to submit its speakers and writings for vetting and to show greater obedience to the bishops i apologize if this seems blunt but what i must say is too important to dress up in flowery language müller declared the fundamental theses of conscious evolution are opposed to christian revelation and when taken unreflectively lead almost necessarily to fundamental errors regarding the omnipotence of god the incarnation of christ the reality of original sin and other matters of church dogma müller stopped short of using the hword but heresy was on his mind conscious evolution does not offer anything which will nourish religious life as a privileged and prophetic witness rooted in christ revealing divine love to a wounded world how did a movement of theology and nature go so terribly wrong either muller doesnt understand what conscious evolution means margaret susan thompson a syracuse university scholar on religious life told globalpost or hes using it like in cold war when they accused sen claude pepper of having a sister who was a thespian because it sounded like lesbian responding to müller in a post on national catholic reporter website barbara marx hubbard a noncatholic who spoke at an lcwr conference and is president of the foundation for conscious evolution cited teilhard and the late passionist father thomas berry no relation to this writer a prolific writer on ecology and spirituality as major influences on the burgeoning movement for me the most vital source of meaning of conscious evolution is the catholic understanding of god and christ as the source of evolution as its driving force as well as its direction said hubbard through science research technology communications and virtually every other area of human activity we are weaving a delicate membrane of consciousness what teilhard called the noosphere or the thinking layer of earth that is embracing and drawing into itself the entire planet teilhard who died before climate change became an issue saw the noosphere in a mystical light a reach closer to god father berry wrote with a lyrical sensibility setting what he called deep ecology in a thematic line with dante and early mystic saints notably francis of assisi and hildegard of bingen in the dream of the earth 1988 berry called for a spiritual context to the ecological age and bemoaned societys neglect of faith in favor of reason its exaltation of technology as the instrument for the conquest of nature in this disintegrating phase of our industrial society the priest wrote we now see ourselves not as the splendor of creation but as the most pernicious mode of earthly beingwe are the violation of the earths most sacred aspects cardinal müller did not respond to an interview request his denunciation of conscious evolution suggests that the first duty of theology is to uphold past teaching rather than draw from an interdisciplinary well as the nuns leadership conference has done in choosing their speakers theology can not continue to develop apart from 21stcentury cosmology and ecology nor can science substitute for religion franciscan sister ilia delio a research theologian at georgetown university wrote in a 2011 essay for america magazine both the light of faith and the insights of science can help humanity evolve toward a more sustainable future as the standoff between the vatican doctrinal office and lcwr deepens the sisters leadership has chosen a path of silence — selfmuzzling —apparently to avoid the risk of more punishment pope francis though speaking passionately about care of the earth has through his silence given de facto support to cardinal müller müller did not give a considered response to conscious evolution sister christine schenk of cleveland who is writing a book on women in the early church told globalpost to me he clearly has not engaged the deep strand of theological reflection from thomas berry and teilhard its not lightweight stuff theres a lot of science involved why is this an issue the lcwr conferences are not presented as official teachings of the catholic church — another source of conflict with the bishops the nuns are trying to engage the world as it is says schenk how do we live the gospel in the midst of an evolving universe these are important questions that need to be engaged by anyone curious about the gospel this article was published by global post print this story",

piece that al gores published in rolling stone during the summer of 2011 in discussing it last week with some college freshman a group old enough to be voting in next months election i mentioned that al gore was a few dimpled chads away from having become president not understanding the allusion they reminded me that bush v gore was decided when they were 6 very few of them had ever read rolling stone although several had heard of it an inconvenient truth was released when they were 11 or 12 years old — a really long time ago — and a few had gone to see it with their parents not a single one had heard of the sierra club but this piece by al gore resonated with them i am reposting in its entirety because like them i think it might be more important than the attention it received when it came out not because there is anything new in it certainly not new to me this has all been said by many people sometimes more eloquently over and over again but the themes are ones that meant a lot to them and some of this was indeed new to them that climate change is real that is a serious threat to their future and that american democracy has so far failed to do much about it ok they suspected that that our collective inaction is no accident that was mostly new how there have been initiatives aimed at sowing doubt discrediting not just climate science but smearing and harassing respected climate scientists and even science itself just like what happened with tobacco and ddt and that journalism is failing us with its underreporting and its false balance raising even more doubt about indisputable facts in america than anywhere in the world see this the connections among doubting climate science oil and gas interests and money in politics is not lost on them but neither is it something with which they are particularly familiar they found gores way of describing these connections plausible and hard to believe at the same time so they plan to look into it more and they noticed that no one seems to be talking much about climate change on the campaign trail during a presidential election year students found that hard to understand could it be that after saying at the dnc that climate change is not a hoax obama does not want to actively position himself as the one who believes in science as one of those 18yearolds put it if that is too risky were really fked •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• al gore july 6 2011 illustration by matt mahurin climate of denial can science and the truth withstand the merchants of poison the first time i remember hearing the question is it real was when i went as a young boy to see a traveling show put on by professional wrestlers one summer evening in the gym of the forks river elementary school in elmwood tennessee the evidence that it was real was palpable theyre really hurting each other thats real blood look athere they cant fake that on the other hand there was clearly a script or in todays language a narrative with good guys to cheer and bad guys to boo but the most unusual and in some ways most interesting character in these dramas was the referee whenever the bad guy committed a gross and obvious violation of the rules — such as they were — like using a metal folding chair to smack the good guy in the head the referee always seemed to be preoccupied with one of the cornermen or looking the other way yet whenever the good guy — after absorbing more abuse and unfairness than any reasonable person could tolerate — committed the slightest infraction the referee was all over him the answer to the question is it real seemed connected to the question of whether the referee was somehow confused about his role was he too an entertainer scorched earth how climate change is spreading drought throughout the globe that is pretty much the role now being played by most of the news media in refereeing the current wrestling match over whether global warming is real and whether it has any connection to the constant dumping of 90 million tons of heattrapping emissions into the earths thin shell of atmosphere every 24 hours admittedly the contest over global warming is a challenge for the referee because its a tagteam match a real freeforall in one corner of the ring are science and reason in the other corner poisonous polluters and rightwing ideologues the referee — in this analogy the news media — seems confused about whether he is in the news business or the entertainment business is he responsible for ensuring a fair match or is he part of the show selling tickets and building the audience the referee certainly seems distracted by donald trump charlie sheen the latest reality show — the list of serial obsessions is too long to enumerate here but whatever the cause the referee appears not to notice that the polluters and ideologues are trampling all over the rules of democratic discourse they are financing pseudoscientists whose job is to manufacture doubt about what is true and what is false buying elected officials wholesale with bribes that the politicians themselves have made legal and can now be made in secret spending hundreds of millions of dollars each year on misleading advertisements in the mass media hiring four anticlimate lobbyists for every member of the us senate and house of representatives question would michael jordan have been a star if he was covered by four defensive players every step he took on the basketball court this script of course is not entirely new a halfcentury ago when science and reason established the linkage between cigarettes and lung diseases the tobacco industry hired actors dressed them up as doctors and paid them to look into television cameras and tell people that the linkage revealed in the surgeon generals report was not real at all the show went on for decades with more americans killed each year by cigarettes than all of the us soldiers killed in all of world war ii this time the scientific consensus is even stronger it has been endorsed by every national academy of science of every major country on the planet every major professional scientific society related to the study of global warming and 98 percent of climate scientists throughout the world in the latest and most authoritative study by 3000 of the very best scientific experts in the world the evidence was judged unequivocal but wait the good guys transgressed the rules of decorum as evidenced in their private emails that were stolen and put on the internet the referee is all over it penalty go to your corner and in their 3000page report the scientists made some mistakes another penalty and if more of the audience is left confused about whether the climate crisis is real well the show must go on after all its entertainment there are tickets to be sold eyeballs to glue to the screen part of the script for this show was leaked to the new york times as early as 1991 in an internal document a consortium of the largest globalwarming polluters spelled out their principal strategy reposition global warming as theory rather than fact ever since they have been sowing doubt even more effectively than the tobacco companies before them to sell their false narrative the polluters and ideologues have found it essential to undermine the publics respect for science and reason by attacking the integrity of the climate scientists that is why the scientists are regularly accused of falsifying evidence and exaggerating its implications in a greedy effort to win more research grants or secretly pursuing a hidden political agenda to expand the power of government such slanderous insults are deeply ironic extremist ideologues — many financed or employed by carbon polluters — accusing scientists of being greedy extremist ideologues after world war ii a philosopher studying the impact of organized propaganda on the quality of democratic debate wrote the conversion of all questions of truth into questions of power has attacked the very heart of the distinction between true and false is the climate crisis real yes of course it is pause for a moment to consider these events of just the past 12 months • heat according to nasa 2010 was tied with 2005 as the hottest year measured since instruments were first used systematically in the 1880s nineteen countries set alltime high temperature records one city in pakistan mohenjodaro reached 1283 degrees fahrenheit the hottest temperature ever measured in an asian city nine of the 10 hottest years in history have occurred in the last 13 years the past decade was the hottest ever measured even though half of that decade represented a solar minimum — the low ebb in the natural cycle of solar energy emanating from the sun • floods megafloods displaced 20 million people in pakistan further destabilizing a nucleararmed country inundated an area of australia larger than germany and france combined flooded 28 of the 32 districts that make up colombia where it has rained almost continuously for the past year caused a thousandyear flood in my home city of nashville and led to alltime record flood levels in the mississippi river valley many places around the world are now experiencing larger and more frequent extreme downpours and snowstorms last years snowmaggedon in the northeastern united states is part of the same pattern notwithstanding the guffaws of deniers • drought historic drought and fires in russia killed an estimated 56000 people and caused wheat and other food crops in russia ukraine and kazakhstan to be removed from the global market contributing to a record spike in food prices practically everything is burning russian president dmitry medvedev declared whats happening with the planets climate right now needs to be a wakeup call to all of us the drought level in much of texas has been raised from extreme to exceptional the highest category this spring the majority of the counties in texas were on fire and gov rick perry requested a major disaster declaration for all but two of the states 254 counties arizona is now fighting the largest fire in its history since 1970 the fire season throughout the american west has increased by 78 days extreme droughts in central china and northern france are currently drying up reservoirs and killing crops • melting ice an enormous mass of ice four times larger than the island of manhattan broke off from northern greenland last year and slipped into the sea the acceleration of ice loss in both greenland and antarctica has caused another upward revision of global sealevel rise and the numbers of refugees expected from lowlying coastal areas the arctic ice cap which reached a record low volume last year has lost as much as 40 percent of its area during summer in just 30 years these extreme events are happening in real time it is not uncommon for the nightly newscast to resemble a nature hike through the book of revelation yet most of the news media completely ignore how such events are connected to the climate crisis or dismiss the connection as controversial after all there are scientists on one side of the debate and deniers on the other a fox news executive in an internal email to the networks reporters and editors that later became public questioned the veracity of climate change data and ordered the journalists to refrain from asserting that the planet has warmed or cooled in any given period without immediately pointing out that such theories are based upon data that critics have called into question but in the real world the record droughts fires floods and mudslides continue to increase in severity and frequency leading climate scientists like jim hansen and kevin trenberth now say that events like these would almost certainly not be occurring without the influence of manmade global warming and thats a shift in the way they frame these impacts scientists used to caution that we were increasing the probability of such extreme events by loading the dice — pumping more carbon into the atmosphere now the scientists go much further warning that we are painting more dots on the dice we are not only more likely to roll 12s we are now rolling 13s and 14s in other words the biggest storms are not only becoming more frequent they are getting bigger stronger and more destructive the only plausible explanation for the rise in weatherrelated catastrophes is climate change munich re one of the two largest reinsurance companies in the world recently stated the view that weather extremes are more frequent and intense due to global warming coincides with the current state of scientific knowledge many of the extreme and destructive events are the result of the rapid increase in the amount of heat energy from the sun that is trapped in the atmosphere which is radically disrupting the planets water cycle more heat energy evaporates more water into the air and the warmer air holds a lot more moisture this has huge consequences that we now see all around the world when a storm unleashes a downpour of rain or snow the precipitation does not originate just in the part of the sky directly above where it falls storms reach out — sometimes as far as 2000 miles — to suck in water vapor from large areas of the sky including the skies above oceans where water vapor has increased by four percent in just the last 30 years scientists often compare this phenomenon to what happens in a bathtub when you open the drain the water rushing out comes from the whole tub not just from the part of the tub directly above the drain and when the tub is filled with more water more goes down the drain in the same way when the warmer sky is filled with a lot more water vapor there are bigger downpours when a storm cell opens the drain in many areas these bigger downpours also mean longer periods between storms — at the same time that the extra heat in the air is also drying out the soil that is part of the reason so many areas have been experiencing both record floods and deeper longerlasting droughts moreover the scientists have been warning us for quite some time — in increasingly urgent tones — that things will get much much worse if we continue the reckless dumping of more and more heattrapping pollution into the atmosphere drought is projected to spread across significant highly populated areas of the globe throughout this century look at what the scientists say is in store for the mediterranean nations should we care about the loss of spain france italy the balkans turkey tunisia look at what they say is in store for mexico should we notice should we care maybe its just easier psychologically to swallow the lie that these scientists who devote their lives to their work are actually greedy deceivers and leftwing extremists — and that we should instead put our faith in the pseudoscientists financed by large carbon polluters whose business plans depend on their continued use of the atmospheric commons as a place to dump their gaseous heattrapping waste without limit or constraint free of charge the truth is this what we are doing is functionally insane if we do not change this pattern we will condemn our children and all future generations to struggle with ecological curses for several millennia to come twenty percent of the globalwarming pollution we spew into the sky each day will still be there 20000 years from now we do have another choice renewable energy sources are coming into their own both solar and wind will soon produce power at costs that are competitive with fossil fuels indications are that twice as many solar installations were erected worldwide last year as compared to 2009 the reductions in cost and the improvements in efficiency of photovoltaic cells over the past decade appear to be following an exponential curve that resembles a less dramatic but still startling version of what happened with computer chips over the past 50 years enhanced geothermal energy is potentially a nearly limitless source of competitive electricity increased energy efficiency is already saving businesses money and reducing emissions significantly new generations of biomass energy — ones that do not rely on food crops unlike the mistaken strategy of making ethanol from corn — are extremely promising sustainable forestry and agriculture both make economic as well as environmental sense and all of these options would spread even more rapidly if we stopped subsidizing big oil and coal and put a price on carbon that reflected the true cost of fossil energy — either through the muchmaligned capandtrade approach or through a revenueneutral tax swap all over the world the grassroots movement in favor of changing public policies to confront the climate crisis and build a more prosperous sustainable future is growing rapidly but most governments remain paralyzed unable to take action — even after years of volatile gasoline prices repeated wars in the persian gulf one energyrelated disaster after another and a seemingly endless stream of unprecedented and lethal weather disasters continuing on our current course would be suicidal for global civilization but the key question is how do we drive home that fact in a democratic society when questions of truth have been converted into questions of power when the distinction between what is true and what is false is being attacked relentlessly and when the referee in the contest between truth and falsehood has become an entertainer selling tickets to a phony wrestling match the wrestling ring in this metaphor is the conversation of democracy it used to be called the public square in ancient athens it was the agora in the roman republic it was the forum in the egypt of the recent arab spring tahrir square was both real and metaphorical — encompassing facebook twitter aljazeera and texting in the america of the late18th century the conversation that led to our own spring took place in printed words pamphlets newsprint books the republic of letters it represented the fullest flower of the enlightenment during which the oligarchic power of the monarchies the feudal lords and the medieval church was overthrown and replaced with a new sovereign the rule of reason the public square that gave birth to the new consciousness of the enlightenment emerged in the dozen generations following the invention of the printing press — the gutenberg galaxy the scholar marshall mcluhan called it — a space in which the conversation of democracy was almost equally accessible to every literate person individuals could both find the knowledge that had previously been restricted to elites and contribute their own ideas ideas that found resonance with others rose in prominence much the way google searches do today finding an ever larger audience and becoming a source of political power for individuals with neither wealth nor force of arms thomas paine to take one example emigrated from england to philadelphia with no wealth no family connections and no power other than that which came from his ability to think and write clearly — yet his common sense became the harry potter of revolutionary america the public interest mattered was actively discussed and pursued but the public square that gave birth to america has been transformed beyond all recognition the conversation that matters most to the shaping of the public mind now takes place on television newspapers and magazines are in decline the internet still in its early days will one day support business models that make true journalism profitable — but up until now the only successful news websites aggregate content from struggling print publications web versions of the newspapers themselves are with few exceptions not yet making money they bring to mind the classic image of wile e coyote running furiously in midair just beyond the edge of the cliff before plummeting to the desert floor far beneath him the average american meanwhile is watching television an astonishing five hours a day in the average household at least one television set is turned on more than eight hours a day moreover approximately 75 percent of those using the internet frequently watch television at the same time that they are online unlike access to the public square of early america access to television requires large amounts of money thomas paine could walk out of his front door in philadelphia and find a dozen competing lowcost print shops within blocks of his home today if he traveled to the nearest tv station or to the headquarters of nearby comcast — the dominant television provider in america — and tried to deliver his new ideas to the american people he would be laughed off the premises the public square that used to be a commons has been refeudalized and the gatekeepers charge large rents for the privilege of communicating to the american people over the only medium that really affects their thinking citizens are now referred to more commonly as consumers or the audience that is why up to 80 percent of the campaign budgets for candidates in both major political parties is devoted to the purchase of 30second tv ads since the rates charged for these commercials increase each year the candidates are forced to raise more and more money in each twoyear campaign cycle of course the only reliable sources from which such large sums can be raised continuously are business lobbies organized labor a shadow of its former self struggles to compete and individuals are limited by law to making small contributions during the 2008 campaign there was a bubble of hope that internetbased fundraising might even the scales but in the end democrats as well as republicans relied far more on traditional sources of large contributions moreover the recent deregulation of unlimited — and secret — donations by wealthy corporations has made the imbalance even worse in the new ecology of political discourse specialinterest contributors of the large sums of money now required for the privilege of addressing voters on a wholesale basis are not squeamish about asking for the quo they expect in return for their quid politicians who dont acquiesce dont get the money they need to be elected and reelected and the impact is doubled when special interests make clear — usually bluntly — that the money they are withholding will go instead to opponents who are more than happy to pledge the desired quo politicians have been racing to the bottom for some time and are presently tunneling to new depths it is now commonplace for congressmen and senators first elected decades ago — as i was — to comment in private that the whole process has become unbelievably crass degrading and horribly destructive to the core values of american democracy largely as a result the concerns of the wealthiest individuals and corporations routinely trump the concerns of average americans and small businesses there are a ridiculously large number of examples eliminating the inheritance tax paid by the wealthiest one percent of families is considered a much higher priority than addressing the suffering of the millions of longterm unemployed wall streets interest in legalizing gambling in trillions of dollars of derivatives was considered way more important than protecting the integrity of the financial system and the interests of middleincome home buyers its a long list almost every group organized to promote and protect the public interest has been backpedaling and on the defensive by sharp contrast when a coalition of powerful special interests sets out to manipulate us policy their impact can be startling — and the damage to the true national interest can be devastating in 2002 for example the feverish desire to invade iraq required convincing the american people that saddam hussein was somehow responsible for attacking the united states on september 11th 2001 and that he was preparing to attack us again perhaps with nuclear weapons when the evidence — the facts — stood in the way of that effort to shape the public mind they were ridiculed maligned and ignored behind the scenes the intelligence was manipulated and the public was intentionally deceived allies were pressured to adopt the same approach with their publics a recent inquiry in the uk confirmed this yet again we knew at the time that the purpose of the dossier was precisely to make a case for war rather than setting out the available intelligence maj gen michael laurie testified to make the best out of sparse and inconclusive intelligence the wording was developed with care why as british intelligence put it the overthrow of saddam was a prize because it could give new security to oil supplies that goal — the real goal — could have been debated on its own terms but as bush administration officials have acknowledged a truly candid presentation would not have resulted in sufficient public support for the launching of a new war they knew that because they had studied it and polled it so they manipulated the debate downplayed the real motive for the invasion and made a different case to the public — one based on falsehoods and the referee — the news media — looked the other way some like fox news were hyperactive cheerleaders others were intimidated into going along by the vitriol heaped on any who asked inconvenient questions they know it many now acknowledge it sheepishly and apologetically senators themselves fell with a few honorable exceptions into the same two camps a few weeks before the united states invaded iraq the late robert byrd — god rest his soul — thundered on the senate floor about the pitiful quality of the debate over the choice between war and peace yet this chamber is for the most part silent — ominously dreadfully silent there is no debate no discussion no attempt to lay out for the nation the pros and cons of this particular war there is nothing the chamber was silent in part because many senators were somewhere else — attending cocktail parties and receptions largely with specialinterest donors raising money to buy tv ads for their next campaigns nowadays in fact the scheduling of many specialinterest fundraisers mirrors the schedule of votes pending in the house and senate by the time we invaded iraq polls showed nearly threequarters of the american people were convinced that the person responsible for the planes flying into the world trade center towers was indeed saddam hussein the rest is history — though as faulkner wrote the past is never dead its not even past because of that distortion of the truth in the past we are still in iraq and because the bulk of our troops and intelligence assets were abruptly diverted from afghanistan to iraq we are also still in afghanistan in the same way because the banks had their way with congress when it came to gambling on unregulated derivatives and recklessly endangering credit markets with subprime mortgages we still have almost doubledigit unemployment historic deficits greece and possibly other european countries teetering on the edge of default and the threat of a doubledip recession even the potential default of the united states of america is now being treated by many politicians and too many in the media as yet another phony wrestling match a political game are the potential economic consequences of a us default real of course they are have we gone completely nuts we havent gone nuts — but the conversation of democracy has become so deeply dysfunctional that our ability to make intelligent collective decisions has been seriously impaired throughout american history we relied on the vibrancy of our public square — and the quality of our democratic discourse — to make better decisions than most nations in the history of the world but we are now routinely making really bad decisions that completely ignore the best available evidence of what is true and what is false when the distinction between truth and falsehood is systematically attacked without shame or consequence — when a great nation makes crucially important decisions on the basis of completely false information that is no longer adequately filtered through the factchecking function of a healthy and honest public discussion — the public interest is severely damaged that is exactly what is happening with us decisions regarding the climate crisis the best available evidence demonstrates beyond any reasonable doubt that the reckless spewing of globalwarming pollution in obscene quantities into the atmospheric commons is having exactly the consequences long predicted by scientists who have analyzed the known facts according to the laws of physics the emergence of the climate crisis seems sudden only because of a relatively recent discontinuity in the relationship between human civilization and the planets ecological system in the past century we have quadrupled global population while relying on the burning of carbonbased fuels — coal oil and gas — for 85 percent of the worlds energy we are also cutting and burning forests that would otherwise help remove some of the added co2 from the atmosphere and have converted agriculture to an industrial model that also runs on carbonbased fuels and stripmines carbonrich soils the cumulative result is a radically new reality — and since human nature makes us vulnerable to confusing the unprecedented with the improbable it naturally seems difficult to accept moreover since this new reality is painful to contemplate and requires big changes in policy and behavior that are at the outer limit of our ability it is all too easy to fall into the psychological state of denial as with financial issues like subprime mortgages and credit default swaps the climate crisis can seem too complex to worry about especially when the shills for the polluters constantly claim its all a hoax anyway and since the early impacts of climatic disruption are distributed globally they masquerade as an abstraction that is safe to ignore these vulnerabilities rooted in our human nature are being manipulated by the tagteam of polluters and ideologues who are trying to deceive us and the referee — the news media — is once again distracted as with the invasion of iraq some are hyperactive cheerleaders for the deception while others are intimidated into complicity timidity and silence by the astonishing vitriol heaped upon those who dare to present the best evidence in a professional manner just as tv networks who beat the drums of war prior to the iraq invasion were rewarded with higher ratings networks now seem reluctant to present the truth about the link between carbon pollution and global warming out of fear that conservative viewers will change the channel — and fear that they will receive a torrent of flame emails from deniers many politicians unfortunately also fall into the same two categories those who cheerlead for the deniers and those who cower before them the latter group now includes several candidates for the republican presidential nomination who have felt it necessary to abandon their previous support for action on the climate crisis at least one has been apologizing profusely to the deniers and begging for their forgiveness intimidation and timidity are connected by more than a shared word root the first is designed to produce the second as yeats wrote almost a century ago the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity barack obamas approach to the climate crisis represents a special case that requires careful analysis his election was accompanied by intense hope that many things in need of change would change some things have but others have not climate policy unfortunately is in the second category why first of all anyone who honestly examines the incredible challenges confronting president obama when he took office has to feel enormous empathy for him the great recession with the high unemployment and the enormous public and private indebtedness it produced two seemingly interminable wars an intractable political opposition whose true leaders — entertainers masquerading as pundits — openly declared that their objective was to ensure that the new president failed a badly broken senate that is almost completely paralyzed by the threat of filibuster and is controlled lock stock and barrel by the oil and coal industries a contingent of nominal supporters in congress who are indentured servants of the same special interests that control most of the republican party and a ferocious wellfinanced and dishonest campaign poised to vilify anyone who dares offer leadership for the reduction of globalwarming pollution in spite of these obstacles president obama included significant climatefriendly initiatives in the economic stimulus package he presented to congress during his first month in office with the skillful leadership of house speaker nancy pelosi and committee chairmen henry waxman and ed markey he helped secure passage of a capandtrade measure in the house a few months later he implemented historic improvements in fuelefficiency standards for automobiles and instructed the environmental protection agency to move forward on the regulation of globalwarming pollution under the clean air act he appointed many excellent men and women to key positions and they in turn have made hundreds of changes in environmental and energy policy that have helped move the country forward slightly on the climate issue during his first six months he clearly articulated the link between environmental security economic security and national security — making the case that a national commitment to renewable energy could simultaneously reduce unemployment dependence on foreign oil and vulnerability to the disruption of oil markets dominated by the persian gulf reserves and more recently as the issue of longterm debt has forced discussion of new revenue he proposed the elimination of unnecessary and expensive subsidies for oil and gas but in spite of these and other achievements president obama has thus far failed to use the bully pulpit to make the case for bold action on climate change after successfully passing his green stimulus package he did nothing to defend it when congress decimated its funding after the house passed cap and trade he did little to make passage in the senate a priority senate advocates — including one republican — felt abandoned when the president made concessions to oil and coal companies without asking for anything in return he has also called for a massive expansion of oil drilling in the united states apparently in an effort to defuse criticism from those who argue speciously that drill baby drill is the answer to our growing dependence on foreign oil the failure to pass legislation to limit globalwarming pollution ensured that the muchanticipated copenhagen summit on a global treaty in 2009 would also end in failure the president showed courage in attending the summit and securing a rhetorical agreement to prevent a complete collapse of the international process but thats all it was — a rhetorical agreement during the final years of the bushcheney administration the rest of the world was waiting for a new president who would aggressively tackle the climate crisis — and when it became clear that there would be no real change from the bush era the agenda at copenhagen changed from how do we complete this historic breakthrough to how can we paper over this embarrassing disappointment some concluded from the failure in copenhagen that it was time to give up on the entire unsponsored process for seeking an international agreement to reduce both globalwarming pollution and deforestation ultimately however the only way to address the climate crisis will be with a global agreement that in one way or another puts a price on carbon and whatever approach is eventually chosen the us simply must provide leadership by changing our own policy yet without presidential leadership that focuses intensely on making the public aware of the reality we face nothing will change the real power of any president as richard neustadt wrote is the power to persuade yet president obama has never presented to the american people the magnitude of the climate crisis he has simply not made the case for action he has not defended the science against the ongoing withering and dishonest attacks nor has he provided a presidential venue for the scientific community — including our own national academy — to bring the reality of the science before the public here is the core of it we are destroying the climate balance that is essential to the survival of our civilization this is not a distant or abstract threat it is happening now the united states is the only nation that can rally a global effort to save our future and the president is the only person who can rally the united states many political advisers assume that a president has to deal with the world of politics as he finds it and that it is unwise to risk political capital on an effort to actually lead the country toward a new understanding of the real threats and real opportunities we face concentrate on the politics of reelection they say dont take chances all that might be completely understandable and make perfect sense in a world where the climate crisis wasnt real those of us who support and admire president obama understand how difficult the politics of this issue are in the context of the massive opposition to doing anything at all — or even to recognizing that there is a crisis and assuming that the republicans come to their senses and avoid nominating a clown his reelection is likely to involve a hardfought battle with high stakes for the country all of his supporters understand that it would be selfdefeating to weaken obama and heighten the risk of another step backward even writing an article like this one carries risks opponents of the president will excerpt the criticism and strip it of context but in this case the president has reality on his side the scientific consensus is far stronger today than at any time in the past here is the truth the earth is round saddam hussein did not attack us on 911 elvis is dead obama was born in the united states and the climate crisis is real it is time to act those who profit from the unconstrained pollution that is the primary cause of climate change are determined to block our perception of this reality they have help from many sides from the private sector which is now free to make unlimited and secret campaign contributions from politicians who have conflated their tenures in office with the pursuit of the peoples best interests and — tragically — from the press itself which treats deception and falsehood on the same plane as scientific fact and calls it objective reporting of alternative opinions all things are not equally true it is time to face reality we ignored reality in the marketplace and nearly destroyed the world economic system we are likewise ignoring reality in the environment and the consequences could be several orders of magnitude worse determining what is real can be a challenge in our culture but in order to make wise choices in the presence of such grave risks we must use common sense and the rule of reason in coming to an agreement on what is true so how can we make it happen how can we as individuals make a difference in five basic ways first become a committed advocate for solving the crisis you can start with something simple speak up whenever the subject of climate arises when a friend or acquaintance expresses doubt that the crisis is real or that its some sort of hoax dont let the opportunity pass to put down your personal marker the civil rights revolution may have been driven by activists who put their lives on the line but it was partly won by average americans who began to challenge racist comments in everyday conversations second deepen your commitment by making consumer choices that reduce energy use and reduce your impact on the environment the demand by individuals for change in the marketplace has already led many businesses to take truly significant steps to reduce their globalwarming pollution some of the corporate changes are more symbolic than real — greenwashing as its called — but a surprising amount of real progress is taking place walmart to pick one example is moving aggressively to cut its carbon footprint by 20 million metric tons in part by pressuring its suppliers to cut down on wasteful packaging and use lowercarbon transportation alternatives reward those companies that are providing leadership third join an organization committed to action on this issue the alliance for climate protection climateprotectorg which i chair has grassroots action plans for the summer and fall that spell out lots of ways to fight effectively for the policy changes we need we can also enable you to host a slide show in your community on solutions to the climate crisis — presented by one of the 4000 volunteers we have trained invite your friends and neighbors to come and then enlist them to join the cause fourth contact your local newspapers and television stations when they put out claptrap on climate — and let them know youre fed up with their stubborn and cowardly resistance to reporting the facts of this issue one of the main reasons they are so wimpy and irresponsible about global warming is that theyre frightened of the reaction they get from the deniers when they report the science objectively so let them know that deniers are not the only ones in town with game stay on them dont let up its true that some media outlets are getting instructions from their owners on this issue and that others are influenced by big advertisers but many of them are surprisingly responsive to a genuine outpouring of opinion from their viewers and readers it is way past time for the ref to do his job finally and above all dont give up on the political system even though it is rigged by special interests it is not so far gone that candidates and elected officials dont have to pay attention to persistent engaged and committed individuals president franklin roosevelt once told civil rights leaders who were pressing him for change that he agreed with them about the need for greater equality for black americans then as the story goes he added with a wry smile now go out and make me do it to make our elected leaders take action to solve the climate crisis we must forcefully communicate the following message i care a lot about global warming i am paying very careful attention to the way you vote and what you say about it if you are on the wrong side i am not only going to vote against you i will work hard to defeat you — regardless of party if you are on the right side i will work hard to elect you why do you think president obama and congress changed their game on dont ask dont tell it happened because enough americans delivered exactly that tough message to candidates who wanted their votes when enough people care passionately enough to drive that message home on the climate crisis politicians will look at their hole cards and enough of them will change their game to make all the difference we need this is not naive trust me on this it may take more individual voters to beat the polluters and ideologues now than it once did — when specialinterest money was less dominant but when enough people speak this way to candidates and convince them that they are dead serious about it change will happen — both in congress and in the white house as the great abolitionist leader frederick douglass once observed power concedes nothing without a demand it never did and it never will what is now at risk in the climate debate is nothing less than our ability to communicate with one another according to a protocol that binds all participants to seek reason and evaluate facts honestly the ability to perceive reality is a prerequisite for selfgovernance wishful thinking and denial lead to dead ends when it works the democratic process helps clear the way toward reality by exposing false argumentation to the best available evidence that is why the constitution affords such unique protection to freedom of the press and of speech the climate crisis in reality is a struggle for the soul of america it is about whether or not we are still capable — given the ill health of our democracy and the current dominance of wealth over reason — of perceiving important and complex realities clearly enough to promote and protect the sustainable wellbeing of the many what hangs in the balance is the future of civilization

notion of manmade climate change well yeah i dont agree with the notion that some are putting out there including scientists that somehow there are actions we can take today that would actually have an impact on whats happening in our climate he said yesterday on abcs this week he continued our climate is always changing and what they have chosen to do is take a handful of decades of research and say that this is now evidence of a longerterm trend thats directly and almost solely attributable to manmade activitiesi dont know of any era in world history where the climate has been stable

long time justin gillis at the new york times has a good summary heres an excerpt the collapse of large parts of the ice sheet in west antarctica appears to have begun and is almost certainly unstoppable with global warming accelerating the pace of the disintegration two groups of scientists reported monday the finding which had been feared by some scientists for decades means that a rise in global sea level of at least 10 feet may now be inevitable the rise may continue to be relatively slow for at least the next century or so the scientists said but sometime after that it will probably speed up so sharply as to become a crisis graphic credit above in this graphic the red regions are areas where temperatures have increased the most during the last 50 years particularly in

            "body": "the need for clear demands at the peoples climate march climate action vs climate justice the need for clear demands at the peoples climate march in new york city in new york city on september 21st a major climate march is planned it will take place two days before un secretary general ban kimoons un climate summit–a oneday closed door session where the worlds leaders will discuss ambitions for the upcoming climate conference cop20 in lima peru 350org and avaaz originally called for the march but environmental and climate justice organizations and alliances based in the new yorknew jersey region and across the us demanded and won a seat at the organizing table to attempt to ensure that the voices of front line and impacted communities are heard so what are the demands of the march there are none thats right the march will simply bring together an estimated 200000 people to march through the streets of new york and then there will be no rally no speakers and no strong political demands just people showing up with the overarching message that the worlds leaders should take action on climate change why no solid demands ive been informed by organizers that the reason this march is being held with no actual demands is because we need a big tent a big tent as in the circus is coming to town but this tent is so big that it even includes organizations that support fracking and the tar sands gigaproject yup theyre in the tent too call me crazy but i think that tent is too damn big according to some of the organizers as long as everyone agrees that climate action is needed then its all good but are all climate actions created equal no in fact there is another entity called the climate group that is planning a whole week of activities around the ban kimoon summit to call for climate action who is this climate group they are a selfdescribed campaign whose goal is a low carbon economy okay so well their idea of action on climate change includes many solutions debunked as false by the global climate justice movement including carbon capture and storage and other technologies that allow business as usual to bounce happily along while the planet slowly burns this is not surprising since the climate groups corporate partners include duke energy hsbc goldman sachs greenstone nike and many others the existence of this climate group is why clear justicebased and transformational demands are critical after all this corporate climate group has on its website a call for people to join the peoples climate march using the very language from the marchs own website in september world leaders are coming to new york city for a historic un summit on climate change with our future on the line and the whole world watching lets take a weekend and use it to bend the course of history lets make the peoples climate march the largestever demonstration demanding action on climate change together well take to the streets to demand the world we know is within our reach a world with an economy that works for people and the planet a world safe from the ravages of climate change a world with good jobs clean air and healthy communities for everyone this is the moment to bring our different movements together articulate our common challenges and solutions and go big somehow i really dont think goldman sachs has real solutions to climate change in mind climate justice activists organizations social movements and indigenous peoples all over the world for decades have debated what kind of action should be taken to successfully and justly address climate change because climate action can mean so many different things it can include for example geoengineering—manmade manipulations of nature on such a massive scale that the impacts cant possibly be known but could definitely be catastrophic it can also include actions already taking place such as the building of vast hydroelectric dams that flood vast expanses of land and displace thousands of indigenous peoples or landbased communities climate action also includes ongoing grabbing of land for the development of vast plantations of oil palm gmo soy or nonnative trees for socalled bioenergy so clearly not all climate action is created equal a lack of clear justicebased and ecologically sound demands in this march will leave a vacuum and no vacuum remains empty for long its simple physics the climate group has already set up shop in that space the problem is not just these really creepy bedfellows the media will not cover a march with no demands they will find a message and if its not the climate groups business will save the planet message what will it be i predict the media will head to the us climate movements oddly charismatic de facto leader bill mckibben why is this a problem while the man is a brilliant conservation biologist with a very full grasp of the dire nature and science of climate change he is not an activist and has a very limited understanding of movement strategy and history take for example his june piece in rolling stone magazine a call to arms an invitation to demand action on climate change in the article he explains the importance of the september 21st march in making real strides for climate action he states so in this case taking to the streets is very much necessary its not all thats necessary – a sprawling fossilfuel resistance works on a hundred fronts around the world from putting up solar panels to forcing colleges to divest their oil stocks to electioneering for truly green candidates and its true that marching doesnt always work at the onset of the war in iraq millions marched to no immediate avail but there are moments when its been essential this is how the vietnam war was ended and segregation too – or consider the nuclearfreeze campaign of the early 1980s when half a million people gathered in new yorks central park right okay where to start first of all as has been pointed out to mr mckibben on countless occasions stopping fossil fuels will not stop climate change—though i guess now with this big tent were not even calling for that but anyway if business as usual continues based not on fossil fuels but on bioenergy the us military for example is transitioning some of their fleet to biofuels and is investigating the manufacture of green bombs using synthetic biology then we still lose as a scientist friend calculated replacing the amount of fossil fuels we are currently using with bioenergy would require six planets worth of land we truly do have to change the system not what is fueling it business as usual has to go unfortunately power concedes nothing without a demand in fact power concedes nothing without being given no other options which brings me back to the rolling stone article marching mckibben writes about the power of marching to make great change two of the examples he gives are ending the vietnam war and stopping segregation lets just focus on the vietnam war for a moment yes there were marches and they were huge and they were great there were also mass direct actions such as may day 1971 when affinity groups took over the bridges and traffic circles of washington dc with the aim of shutting down the city my husband orin langelle who was part of an affinity group there watched the marines land at the washington monument the weather underground conducted over 6000 bombings of military targets in the us there were the yippies white panthers the sds and the vvaw moreover the gis in vietnam sick of the pointless and bloody war started turning their weapons on their officers the army was facing a mounting internal rebellion and of course the vietnamese people staged an effective and tireless resistance to the us invasion—even in the face of casualty numbers of more than 50 to one—and even in the face of their luscious homeland being turned into a toxic wasteland by monsantos agent orange the sum total of these parts is what ended the vietnam war not a march not promoting green alternatives to the war and not electoral politics unless you count the yippies running pegasus the pig for president in 1968 people on many fronts made both the war and business as usual impossible likewise with segregation the civil rights movement did not make the gains it made with a march that was organized with the permission of the police there were marches yes but the marches themselves were unpermitted acts of civil disobedience and they were met with extreme repression fuelled by hate we all remember the black and white videos of the fire hoses and the police dogs the many civil rights activists who were beaten jailed murdered and not to forget the crucial role of the black panther party which took up arms in 1966 in order to further advance civil rights and to defend their communities against attacks by the police but they also ran breakfast programs for children and promoted a comprehensive set of demands but back to this march in new york city planned in cooperation with the police and void of demands will the mere presence of 200000 people including representatives of duke energy and goldman sachs marching in the city be meaningful enough to make a difference—to shake up the worlds leaders to take climate change more seriously in his rolling stone piece mckibben quotes a princeton scientist who stated we are all sitting ducks that is true however the missing analysis in this assertion is identifying just exactly who is holding the shotgun the inference is that it is climate change pointing its double barrels at us but i disagree we are sitting ducks alright but the ones threatening our existence are the ones on wall street and its equivalents buying policies that maintain business as usual like chad holliday the chair of bank of america who cochairs the uns absurdly named sustainable energy for all initiative the koch brothers chase manhattan bank oh yes and duke energy and goldman sachs a smorgasbord of the power elite my hope is that folks coming for the march will be inspired by the powerful accomplishments of the movements that came before and will form affinity groups to take their outrage and their demands directly to the source directly to the ones holding the shotguns making their business as usual impossible the climate groups climate week from september 2228 for instance might be an excellent choice take our rage right to the source as dr martin luther king jr pointed out the question is not whether we will be extremists but what kind of extremists we will be the nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists",

era of procrastination of halfmeasures of soothing and baffling expedients of delays is coming to a close posted jan 30 2014 those who fail to learn from history are destined to repeat it goes the saying while there are few historical parallels to the existential threat posed by climate change there is perhaps one nazi aggression during the second world war as the arctic sea ice shrinks we are truly once again in a period of consequences in the years before he served as britains wartime prime minister winston churchill was an outoffavor conservative politician who raised a lone voice about the threat posed by the german nazis—long before most of his colleagues in parliament were prepared to recognize it churchills words from a speech he delivered to the house of commons in november 1936 give an example of how climate change might be described now owing to past neglect in the face of the plainest warnings we have now entered upon a period of danger the era of procrastination of halfmeasures of soothing and baffling expedients of delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences we can not avoid this period we are in it now churchills warnings were wellfounded hitler invaded poland then france and the low countries by may 1940 the continental side of the english channel was occupied illustration by robert patricy as the arctic sea ice shrinks glaciers retreat and devastating floods and heat waves signal profound changes taking place in our earth system we are truly once again in a period of consequences and as was the case in 1936 most politicians are happy to sit on their hands and not even offer halfmeasures quite the opposite in fact as demonstrated by widespread political backing for expanding the exploitation of coal tar sands and shale gas when the threat of aggression became very obvious to the british with dozens of german army divisions and fleets of bombers stationed just a few miles from england churchills words galvanized the nation for the titanic struggle that lay ahead therefore in casting up this dread balance sheet and contemplating our dangers with a disillusioned eye i see great reason for intense vigilance and exertion but none whatever for panic or despair what general weygand called the battle of france is over i expect that the battle of britain is about to begin upon this battle depends the survival of christian civilization hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war if we can stand up to him all europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad sunlit uplands but if we fail then the whole world including the united states including all that we have known and cared for will sink into the abyss of a new dark age made more sinister and perhaps more protracted by the lights of perverted science let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties and so bear ourselves that if the british empire and its commonwealth last for a thousand years men will still say this was their finest hour britain became doggedly focused and swung behind a campaign virtually without parallel president roosevelt moved with similarly determined leadership after the attack on pearl harbor with the united states shifting to a war economy in a matter of months the mobilization between 1939 and 1945 perhaps teaches us that a successful response to broad systemic peril requires a combination of factors scaling up technology broad public support and participation and inspiring leadership spitfires sherman tanks and submarines were massproduced technology was refined leading to the emergence of innovations including jet engines and computers like what youre reading yes is nonprofit and relies on reader support click here to chip in 5 or more to help us keep the inspiration coming when it comes to climate change we have technology with the potential to meet the challenge wind turbines and solar photovoltaics are among a suite of lowcarbon power technologies electric vehicles work we know how to farm more sustainably and have the means to reduce deforestation the fact that these solutions are not being deployed is down to absence of leadership an apparent absence of public demand and crucially the lack of perception of an immediate threat the rapid reorientation of the western economies during wwii was achieved with the backing of voters women went to work in factories rationing schemes were accepted and men queued up to join the fighting forces arousing a similar degree of popular support for action on climate change is a greater challenge not least because the gradual warming of the atmosphere is different from tangible dangers such as imminent invasion the situation is made worse by the activities of a fifth column of climate change deniers their campaign has successfully confused debate to the point where in the united states and united kingdom policy and technology are going into reverse instead of pandering to these dangerous interests as many modern politicians do the street fighter in churchill would have taken them on despite his age and shape churchill was a deft political operator who routinely outmaneuvered his opponents before they struck in his own words churchill summed up his approach thus one ought never to turn ones back on a threatened danger and try to run away from it if you do that you will double the danger but if you meet it promptly and without flinching you will reduce the danger by half never run away from anything never as well as being a gifted brawler churchill knew how to do deals even with people he considered murderous despots his pact with stalin might be compared to modern leaders working with the financial markets that some regard as enemies of democracy but which have the massive resources needed to win the climate war such climate change action could herald a new industrial revolution one rich in jobs and business opportunities when it comes to climate change we have technology with the potential to meet the challenge compared to the second world war the economic reorientation needed to do this is modest great britain devoted more than 40 percent of its gdp to fighting the axis powers just 2 percent of annual global gdp is required to win the carbon war as humankind drifts toward its monumental showdown with nature one that might well leave the second world war looking like a modest emergency the biggest need of all is for leaders who articulate the threat and galvanize action churchill wasnt able to predict events any more than politicians today but he looked squarely at the facts and made judgments that proved correct on climate change and in the face of the plainest warnings we need similarly inspired leadership now tony juniper wrote this article for how to eat like our lives depend on it the winter 2014 issue of yes magazine tony is a campaigner writer and sustainability adviser his latest book what has nature ever done for us is published by synergistic press acknowledgement the idea of churchill as a figure we can learn from in inspiring action on climate change emerged from

associated with tropical cyclone washi known locally as sendong has killed 521 people with many still missing and unaccounted for and displaced over 100000 people the cities of cagayan de oro and iligan were particularly hard hit tropical storm washi dumped on the island of mindanao more than a month of average rains in just 12 hours according to weather forecaster leny ruiz the records show that storms that follow washis track come only once in about 12 years officials claim it was one of the most destructive calamities in southern philippines in recent years and struck areas not used to severe flooding river flooding was worsened by the high tide the storm has left many areas in northern mindanao particularly in cagayan de oro city without electricity and with disruptions to the cities water supply for the population of more than 500000 people there are unidentified bodies piled up in morgues with a shortage of coffins and body bags philippine red cross chairman richard jgordon said that mindanao is not usually a typhoon prone area and residents were caught unprepared mostly shocked by the flash floods that swept away their belongings and source of livelihood such as crops and livestock according to the red cross the worst hit areas were cagayan de oro city with 215 dead and iligan with 195 other areas with casualties were bukidnon 47 compostela valley 5 zamboanga del norte 3 lanao del norte 9 surigao del sur 1 and dumaguete negros oriental 22 vicente emano the mayor of cagayan de oro said i believe the city death toll would eventually reach about 500 in a telephone interview on manila radio station dzmm a nineman team of police and volunteer rescuers for a rescue mission in the flooded libona township were caught by a flashflood as they were about to cross the bubunawan river one policeman was washed away in the incident extreme weather and climate change in all the reports of this extreme weather disaster there is no mention of climate change indeed the philippines region experiences up to 1920 tropical cyclones or typhoons each year with 69 making landfall on a regular basis so this cyclone was just another tropical storm except it dumped an extreme amount of torrential rain over 12 hours was the storm caused by global warming probably not it was in the range of natural variability did human co2 emissions contribute to the storm conditions at least in a small way this is quite likely anthropogenic global warming has warmed the atmosphere so that it carries more moisture that increases the amount of rain a one degree rise in average global temperatures probably adds about 5 in atmospheric carrying capacity kevin trenberth senior scientist at the us national center for atmospheric researchs climate analysis section stated in june 2011 at yale environment 360 the environment in which all storms form has changed owing to human activities global warming has increased temperatures and directly related to that is an increase in the waterholding of the atmosphere over the ocean where there are no water limitations observations confirm that the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere has increased by about 4 percent consistent with a 1 degree f warming of sea surface temperatures since about the 1970s the human component does not change much from year to year and affects all storms the recent un report on extreme weather said that with precipitation it is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation or the proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls will increase in the 21st century over many areas of the globe this is particularly the case in the high latitudes and tropical regions and in winter in the northern midlatitudes heavy rainfalls associated with tropical cyclones are likely to increase with continued warming the torrential rain and flash flooding hit during the middle of friday night catching people largely unawares with many people drowning trapped in their own homes and contributing to the large numbers of dead heavy rain events causing ankle deep flooding is often experienced near the rivers but the flash flood was over 1 metre in iligan and flooding a much greater area than previously experienced this was an extreme weather event that most people were not expecting the flooding was further exacerbated by high tides 2011 started in the philippines with 42 deaths in january from torrential rain and floods brought by la niña in october twin typhoons battered luzon killing 76 people and affecting 285 million people with several months worth of rain falling within a week with projected sea level rise in the future many more people will be affected by storm surge exacerbating flooding during tropical cyclones and typhoons us secretary of state hilary clinton sent a message of support on behalf of president obama and the people of the united states i want to send my deepest condolences for the devastation and loss of life caused by flooding from tropical storm washi in southern philippines clinton said in a statement the us government stands ready to assist philippine authorities as they respond to this tragedy talk is very cheap actions speak much louder maybe the best way the us could help is to make deep cuts in us carbon emissions to mitigate climate change and help reduce the frequency and intensity of future extreme weather events that the philippines and indeed everyone on the globe will experience the obstructive role of the us has resulted in delaying for 10 years further meaningful cuts in emissions in international climate talks under the durban mandate agreement sources",

community and from that community i have received reams of responses most hellos and thankyous many descriptions of their circumstances they have offered to help to come to talk to students to plan a scholarship for a lost neighbors child to take in students for the thanksgiving holiday i read to you from that community now asking you to hear those voices from a wide array of ages and points of views from people who want to write home to this home about themselves they include people in complicated political places like tom dine 62 head of radio free europe who writes as he departs for prague from washington of his need to keep his worldwide 2200 employees well informed they include captain bob shore 69 presently chief pilot in new york for american airlines who took time out to tell of his pride in colgate and ed mcguinn 73 who writes i lost a brother three lifelong friends along with 31 people that had worked with or for me during my 20 years on wall street i was very comforted by the response of the students and faculty to this national crisis they include haleh tavakol wolfe 88 who writes as an iranianamerican alumna i urge you to talk to the students about backlash against muslims arabs and people who appear middle eastern my sister and i both attended colgate as did my husband colgate was a refuge for me while my parents were stuck in iran and being bombed by iraq they include jack butterworth 63s memories of how he and his fraternity brothers stood on the sidewalk for hours to see for ourselves to participate in john f kennedys funeral 38 years ago they include oliver caspers 93s words to us sent from germany where he writes of a nationwide mourning and moment of silence saying im beginning to have hope in the human race if we deal with this delicate situation tenderly and with regard for the future and the future of our children they include buzz buse 64 retired colonel who writes of his service in vietnam and of returning to campus 35 years later for the wonderful experience of discussing varying opinions on that war with alumni and of his hope for students now they include rob cleveland 95 who writes from new york i can only read a portion of his most moving letter which begins dear president pinchin since i graduated from colgate six years ago i have been working in my family business ho penn we are a caterpillar dealer covering connecticut and southern new york that supports the construction and power generation industries normally we are involved in the creation of things like roads buildings and homes that all changed september 11 2001 when we were thrust into the recovery effort in lower manhattan like everyone else i had seen the images of the destruction on tv and i felt confident that i could handle it in person it may be a cliché now but the images on tv are nothing compared to the sight from ground zero what you see on tv is a grated preview to an xrated horror show the size and magnitude of the destruction and the feelings one has upon seeing it are impossible to completely convey i will never forget the burning sensation in my eyes from the smoke that still rises today when i first arrived at ground zero i was struck at how everything for blocks and blocks was covered in concrete dust people had used their fingers to write in that dust the names of loved ones missing of firefighters lost and of promises never to forget these images are a scar etched into my memory and soul for the rest of my life there is something else forever etched into my memory the incredible unity and patriotism i have seen the dedication of people working beyond exhaustion is unbelievable right behind these people are waves of volunteers helping the workers with a warm sandwich or a homemade cup of soup my heart swells with pride at these sights the old image of new york is a thing of the past the cars drive slower and their infamous horns have fallen silent people all over the city are asking each other what they can do to help the emails and phone calls from my colgate classmates have been incredible in their number and reassuring to say the least just the other day a middle eastern man stopped me in the street he asked me if i was working on the world trade center i told him i was as he shook my hand with both of his a lump began to grow in his throat thank you was all he could manage to say it was all i needed to hear i was born here grew up nearby and now live here never until now though could i say with absolute certitude that this is the greatest city in the world we are one now we have a tremendous task ahead but there is no doubt in my mind that we will triumph the voices continue to come forward even as we know nestor cintron 96s scott coleman 94s edward porter felt 81s aaron jacobs 96 david retik 90s todd pelino 89s will not even as sharon balkcom 80 remains missing even as we know of brian lemek 03s sister and bill edwards 52 son and joe burkett 03 and ana calle 05s cousin as we mourn christina cruikshank 91s father and ed mcguinn 73s brother as we mourn with sandra valdez felt 81 megan pezzutti pelino 89 susan zalesne retik 90 and julia wilcox rathkey 84 all of whom lost husbands there will be a time for studied reflection for debate and particularly for a deep acquaintance with world history and ranging perspectives all of which is the duty and responsibility of the university in a serious democracy it is what we do best now is the time for memory for a sense of the heroism we see in these letters for the terrible beauty that yeats saw born in irelands crisis in 1916 taking normal men and women out of their ordinary roles that we see now now is the time that we hold tight to our students including those like gifford foley 03 who is a corporal in the usmc reserves and time when we think of both our own colgate community here and in the world at large and as america the beautiful reminds us of the brotherhood of man remarks made at the family weekend memorial service",
