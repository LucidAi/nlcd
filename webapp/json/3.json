            "text": "Israel has agreed to a ceasefire proposal to end a week of deadly, cross-border fire with the Gaza Strip, but the plan appears doomed after Palestinian militants rejected it.\n\nThe proposal, put together by Egypt, involves the cessation of attacks by both sides and the opening of border crossings from today, while negotiations are held on other details.\n\nHigh-level delegations from Israel and the Palestinian factions would hold separate talks in Cairo within 48 hours to consolidate the ceasefire with \"confidence-building measures\".\n\nAt Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, the security cabinet convened by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu voted to approve the truce deal.\n\nMr Netanyahu said Israel saw in the deal an opportunity to strip the Palestinian enclave of rockets but is prepared to redouble military action there if the cross-border launches persist.\n\n\"We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarisation of the Strip - from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels - through diplomatic means,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"But if Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet.\"\n\nIsrael has mobilised tens of thousands of troops for a threatened Gaza invasion if the rocket salvoes persist.\n\n\"We still have the possibility of going in, under cabinet authority, and putting and end to them (the rockets),\" said Amos Gilad, a senior Israeli defence official and envoy to Cairo.\n\nBut Hamas has reportedly rejected the proposal, and says it only learned of the plan in the media.\n\nSami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, repeated its position that demands it has made must be met before it lays down its weapons.\n\nHamas wants Israeli restrictions on the authorised crossing for food and building materials between Israel and Gaza lifted, and it wants hundreds of its members who have been detained by Israel to be freed.\n\nHamas's armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, rejected the reported text of the truce deal, saying: \"Our battle with the enemy continues and will increase in ferocity and intensity.\"\n\nPalestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, who reached an agreement with Hamas in April that led to the formation of a unity government last month, welcomed the proposal and urged its acceptance.\n\nGaza-based militants fired more than 100 rockets into Israel on Monday, according to the Israeli military, while Israel kept up its air and naval bombardments of the Gaza Strip.\n\nGaza health officials say Israeli attacks have so far killed at least 180 Palestinians and wounded more than 1,300, most of them civilians.\n\nHamas rocket attacks have been regularly intercepted but more than half a dozen Israelis have been wounded since the start of the week-old offensive.\n\nThe frequent rocket salvoes have disrupted life as air raid sirens sent people in much of the country racing to shelters.\n\nAn Israeli official today said the nation has found funding for three new Iron Dome rocket interception batteries\n\nIsrael had seven Iron Domes set up to shoot down missiles when cross-border fighting with Hamas-led militants surged on July 8, and has since brought two more into service, Israel's Defence Ministry said.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, the Israeli official said that as a result of the Gaza crisis, three new Iron Dome units were now \"in the pipeline\".",

            "body": "the absurd times gaza egypt and israel idiotic coverage above a collection of the recent work of carlos latuff contrary to us corporate media there was no genuine ceasefire proposal by egypt a document presented to only one side of the conflict could hardly be taken seriously and it was not presented to hamas it made no provision for all that israel is inflicting on gaza the recent bombings such as the attack on a center for the disabled are called targeted precision attacks against militant leaders abcs dianne sawyer recent aired a devastated palestinian home with people scraping through the rubble as israelis so misinformed and biased is coverage here below are a couple interviews that make all this clear but first a word on the pernicious effect this coverage is having here we fortunately have been immune from such idiocy for a few years perhaps such illbegotten and illraised ignorant idiots have long since abandoned all hope of spreading their delisions here or perhaps out of sheer luck however the following nonsense was posted on a social site as a response to someone else who posted a note all the same i pointed out that all religions have been made ridiculous by their fanatics defined somewhere as someone who would do what god would if he had all the facts this included the christian fanatics who spread their antigay mission to those in africa who now torture and the execute anyone suspected of such deviancy i quote it verbatim and as it appeared so as not to distort you are not going to persuade me to support the palestinian arab cause i abhor the brutality of the arab world beheadings amputations misogyny ignorance i shudder to think of islamic jurisprudence ever being recognized in any country palestinians who live under the israeli jurisdiction are better off financially socially psychologically and emotionally than palestinians who live under hamas che guevara is long dead and so too is the mythology of the freedom warrior the arab world can not develop beyond its current pitiful state unless it recognizes the democratic rights of all people and that includes women and nonarabs inside israel aabs are treated a whole lot better than they might be in arab dominated counties the may suffer the odd incidence of humiliation or some such slight but they will be given due process of a humane and civilized law the biggest favour israel could do for gaza is to rid palestine of hamas﻿ so this is what is out there boldly and proudly stated now for some sense on the issues after palestinian unity deal did israel spark violence to prevent a new peace offensive it is widely thought that the flareup in israel and the occupied territories began with the kidnapping of three israeli teens in the west bank just more than a month ago but our guests — author norman finkelstein and palestinian political analyst mouin rabbani — argue that such a narrative ignores the broader context of decades of occupation and recent events highlighting the expansionist goals of the israeli government in the palestinian land under its control whenever the palestinians seem like they are trying to reach a settlement of the conflict — which the fatahhamas unity government was — at that point israel does everything it can to provoke a violent reaction in this case from hamas break up the unity government and then israel has its pretext finkelstein says rabbani and finkelstein are coauthors of the forthcoming book how to solve the israelpalestine conflict transcript this is a rush transcript copy may not be in its final form amy goodman israeli musician and peace activist david broza whats so funny bout peace love and understanding recorded in an east jerusalem recording studio with israeli palestinian and american musicians the jerusalem youth choir comprised of both palestinian and israeli members lends their voice to the recording this is democracy now democracynoworg the war and peace report im amy goodman with aaron maté aaron maté well with the potential for a ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants in gaza we turn now to the roots of the latest crisis and what can be done to avoid another in the future it is widely thought the flareup began with the kidnappings of three israeli teens in the west bank just over a month ago their dead bodies were found later on but our next guests argue the narrative ignores the broader context of decades of occupation and recent events highlighting the expansionist goals of the israeli government in the palestinian land under its control amy goodman for more were joined by norman finkelstein author and scholar his most recent books are old wine broken bottle ari shavits promised land and knowing too much why the american jewish romance with israel is coming to an end and were joined by mouin rabbani a palestinian political analyst formerly with the international crisis group today both norman finkelstein and mouin rabbani have coauthored a forthcoming book how to solve the israelpalestine conflict we welcome you both to democracy now mouin rabbani were speaking to you over at the hague can you respond to this latest news of the egyptian ceasefire israel accepting and hamas weighing this mouin rabbani well i think amira explained it quite well so far as we can tell hamas has been neither directly nor indirectly consulted on a proposal that basically the egyptians have concocted together with tony blair and the israelis and some other parties the purpose of which appears to be something that hamas can not accept and that can then be used to legitimize an intensification of the israeli assault on the gaza strip the problem for hamas is twofold on the one hand as amira explained it basically restores an acceptable status quo while on the other hand it has been endorsed by the arab league by the pa in ramallah by most of the western powers and so on so it will be difficult for them to either accept or reject it so to speak while at the same time i think the parties that are proposing this ceasefire are making it clear that theyre not really interested in any further negotiation of its terms aaron maté norman finkelstein give us a sketch of the broader context for how this latest flareup began norman finkelstein well before i do im going to just briefly comment on the ceasefire the ceasefire first of all says nothing about the rampages by israel against hamas in the west bank and it was those rampages which caused the current conflict to escalate it gives israel a green light to continue arresting hamas members blowing up homes in the west bank ransacking homes and killing palestinians which was the prelude to the current fighting secondly if you look at the ceasefire its exactly what was agreed on in june—excuse me june 2008 and the same ceasefire that was agreed to in november 2012 namely in both cases it was said that there would be a relaxing of the illegal blockade of gaza in both cases after the ceasefire was signed the blockade was maintained and in fact the blockade was escalated so now in the current version of the ceasefire it said the blockade will be lifted after there has been calm restored and the security situation has been established but if israel says hamas is a terrorist organization then the security situation can never be calm in the gaza and therefore there will be never a lifting of the blockade of gaza so were right back to where we were in june 2008 november 2012 of course hamas is going to reject that kind of agreement it means it legalizes it legitimizes the brutal merciless heartless illegal blockade of gaza as to how we got to where we are the general context is perfectly obvious for anyone who wants to see it a unity government was formed between the pa and hamas netanyahu was enraged at this unity government it called on the us it called on the eu to break relations with the palestinian authority surprisingly the united states said no were going to give this unity government time well see whether it works or not then the eu came in and said it will also give the unity government time lets see lets see what happens at this point netanyahu virtually went berserk and he was determined to break up the unity government when there was the abduction of the three israeli teenagers he found his pretext there isnt a scratch of evidence not a jot of evidence that hamas had anything to do with the kidnappings and the killings nobody even knows what the motive was to this point even if you look at the july 3rd report of human rights watch they said nobody knows who was behind the abductions even the us state department on july 7th there was a news conference and the us state department said we dont have hard evidence about who was responsible but that had nothing to do with it it was just a pretext the pretext was to go into the west bank attack hamas arrest 700 members of hamas blow up two homes carry on these rampages these ransackings and to try to evoke a reaction from hamas this is what israel always does anybody who knows the history its what the israeli political scientist the mainstream political scientist—name was avner yaniv—he said its these palestinian peace offensives whenever the palestinians seem like they are trying to reach a settlement of the conflict which the unity government was at that point israel does everything it can to provoke a violent reaction—in this case from hamas—break up the unity government and israel has its pretext we cant negotiate with the palestinian authority because they only represent some of the palestinian people they dont represent all of the palestinian people and so netanyahu does what he always does—excuse me what israeli governments always do you keep pounding the palestinians in this case pounding hamas pounding hamas trying to evoke a reaction and when the reaction comes—well when the reaction comes he said we cant deal with these people theyre terrorists amy goodman mouin rabbani on this issue of the israeli teens who were kidnapped and then killed when did the israeli government understand that they had been murdered as they carried out the siege to try to find them mouin rabbani well what we know is that one of these youths called the police emergency line immediately after they were abducted and that gunshots can be clearly heard on the recording of that telephone conversation on that basis the israeli security establishment concluded that the three youths had been killed almost as soon as they were abducted and this information was of course known to the israeli government nevertheless netanyahu deliberately suppressed this information using the broad censorship powers that the israeli government has and during this period launched into this organized rampage— amy goodman put a gag order on reporters from reporting this mouin rabbani basically yes that you know this was treated as sensitive security information subject to military censorship and there were only allusions to it and only days after by some israeli journalists and then only referring to some elliptical statements that were being made by israeli military commanders suggesting that you know this is not a hostage rescue situation as netanyahu was presenting it but is more likely to be a search for bodies which is of course how it turned out and the reason that netanyahu suppressed this information is because it gave him the opportunity to launch this organized rampage throughout the west bank to start rearresting prisoners who had been released in 2011 in the prisoner exchange between hamas and israel to intensify the bombing of the gaza strip and generally to whip up mass hysteria within israel which of course resulted in the burning death of the 16yearold palestinian from jerusalem several days later aaron maté mouin youve interviewed hamas leaders the response from the israeli government is always that hamas is committed to israels destruction so therefore how can we possibly negotiate with a unity government that includes them whats your sense of hamass willingness over a long term to reach some sort of agreement or a longterm truce with israel mouin rabbani i think hamas or at least the organization and not necessarily all of its members but its key leaders have long since reconciled themselves with a twostate settlement to the israelipalestinian conflict i think whats been surprising in the past several months has been that the hamas leadership has gone well beyond that in the context of the reconciliation agreement signed on 23 april between fatah and hamas in that agreement they agreed to the formation of a new government which neither hamas nor fatah would enter the cabinet but that the political program of that government would be the political program of the pa president—at the moment mahmoud abbas and what you basically had was abbas stating publicly that he not only accepts the socalled quartet conditions but that in addition he would continue security coordination with israel and you know was making these statements almost on a daily basis and hamas more or less looked the other way and didnt withdraw from the government and this i think reflects in some respects the increasing difficulty hamas was experiencing in governing the gaza strip and funding its government there because of its—because of the increasing hostility or the exceptional inaudible the regime in egypt the deterioration in its relations with iran the inability to replace those with funding from qatar or other sources so you effectively had a government that was not only amenable to a twostate settlement with the support of hamas but it went significantly further and effectively accepted the quartet conditions which most inaudible view as illegitimate and additionally was continuing security coordination with israel that was largely directed at hamas and islamic jihad in the west bank i think—you know and this is—as norman was explaining this is a key reason why netanyahu sought to undermine this agreement and the resulting government amy goodman norman finkelstein why do you think israel has hesitated to launch the invasion their you know thousands of soldiers are lined up along the gaza border norman finkelstein well its interesting because all the—there are a large number of theories that are being spun in particular in the israeli press the answer i think to that question is pretty obvious the israeli domestic population wont tolerate a large number of israeli combatant casualties thats out israel likes to fight—not unlike president obama israel likes to fight hightech—likes to commit hightech massacres and it doesnt want to fight a real war and in 2008 israel carried out executed the big hightech massacre in gaza killed about 1400 palestinians up to 1200 of whom were civilians left behind 600000 tons of rubble dropped the white phosphorus and so forth and for the first time the international community reacted very harshly to it the climax of course was the goldstone report and at that point israel was placed in a very difficult position because on the one hand it cant stop the rocket attacks unless it conducts a ground invasion which is exactly the situation it faced in lebanon in 2006 also the air force cant knock out these rockets theyre shortrange rockets mostly theyre not even rockets but well call them that the air force cant knock them out the only way to get rid of them—exactly as in lebanon in 2006 the only way to get rid of them is by launching a ground invasion however the domestic population wont accept a large number of casualties and the only way you dont have a large number of casualties is if you blast everything in sight within a miles radius which is what israel did in 2008 09 there were only 10 israeli military casualties of those 10 half of them were friendly fire israelis accidentally killing israelis but after the goldstone report and after 2008 09 they cant do that again they cant carry out that kind of massive destruction the 22 days of death and destruction as amnesty international called it they cant do that again a new constraint has been placed on israels political and military echelon so thats the dilemma for them domestically they cant tolerate large numbers of combatant casualties but the only way to prevent that is blasting everything in sight the international community says you cant do that you kill 150 even kill 200 human rights watch said killing 200 palestinians in gaza thats not a war crime they said thats just collective punishment only hamas commits war crimes because one woman apparently died of a heart attack while—israeli woman apparently died of a heart attack while trying to enter a shelter so thats horrible awful thats a war crime but when you kill 200 palestinians 80 percent of whom are civilians about 20 percent of whom are children according to human rights watch thats not a war crime but the international community will accept that much 200 but even human rights watch wont accept if you go in and you do 2008 09 again and so the israeli government is faced with a real dilemma and thats the problem for netanyahu domestically he loses if there are large number of casualties combatant casualties internationally he loses if he tries to do 2008 09 all over again amy goodman which resulted in how many deaths norman finkelstein 2008 09 as i said was about 1400 of whom about up to 1200 were civilians i say 600000 tons of rubble they just left nothing there and by the way that was demanded by tzipi livni on june 8th—excuse me on january 18th tzipi livni the foreign minister then the justice minister now the person whos called a moderate by j street tzipi livni boasted—she went on tv and boasted we demanded hooliganism in gaza thats what i demanded she said and we got it according to j street shes the moderate aaron maté norman as we wrap what needs to be done norman finkelstein what needs to be done is perfectly obvious amnesty international which is a real human rights organization unlike human rights watch—amnesty international issued a statement it said number one there has to be a comprehensive arms embargo on israel and palestine—perfectly reasonable because under international law its illegal to transfer weapons to countries which are major violators of human rights so comprehensive arms embargo on israel and palestine number two international investigation of war crimes on both sides and im saying number three number three has to be—there has to be the imposition of sanctions on israel until and unless it negotiates an end to the occupation according to international law now thats not my suggestion im basing it on the international court of justice south africa occupied namibia the international court of justice said in 1971 if south africa does not engage in goodfaith negotiations to end its occupation of namibia that occupation is illegal under international law israel has refused to engage in goodfaith negotiations to end the occupation of palestine just like in the case of namibia it is now an illegal occupier of palestine and there should be a comprehensive sanctions imposed on israel until and unless it ends the occupation of palestine under the terms of international law amy goodman well leave it there norman finkelstein author and scholar mouin rabbani senior fellow at the institute for palestine studies that does it for this discussion today of course we will continue the discussion of whats happening in gaza this is democracy now back in a minute with 192 dead in gaza is lasting ceasefire possible under israeli occupation the next phase of the violence that has killed nearly 200 palestinians in gaza is in flux after a ceasefire proposal from egypt the egyptian government proposed a temporary halt to violence and the reopening of gazas border crossings followed by talks in cairo on a longterm truce israels security cabinet has endorsed the proposal but hamas has yet to officially respond the hamas military wing has rejected the pact as a surrender saying the ceasefire fails to meet any of its core demands these include a lifting of the siege of gaza the release of prisoners recently detained in israeli raids an end to israeli attacks on the occupied territories and respect for the palestinian unity government but it is hamas political wing that will have the final say earlier today israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu vowed to widen the attack on gaza if hamas rejects the ceasefire and if rocket fire continues the potential for a ceasefire follows a week that saw israel kill at least 192 palestinians in a massive bombing campaign on one of the worlds most densely populated areas the united nations estimates more than 80 percent of gazas dead are civilians including 36 children more than 1000 rockets from gaza have hit israel over the same period with just a fraction landing in urban areas around a dozen israelis have been wounded no casualties have been reported we are joined from ramallah by amira hass haaretz correspondent for the occupied palestinian territories the only israeli journalist to have spent several years living in and reporting from gaza and the west bank transcript this is a rush transcript copy may not be in its final form aaron maté the next phase of the violence thats killed nearly 200 palestinians in gaza is in flux today with a ceasefire still on the table on tuesday the egyptian government proposed a temporary halt to violence and the reopening of gazas border crossings followed by talks in cairo on a longterm truce israels security cabinet has endorsed the proposal but hamas has yet to officially respond the hamas military wing has rejected the pact as a quote surrender saying the ceasefire fails to meet any of its core demands these include a lifting of the seige of gaza the release of prisoners recently detained in israeli raids an end to israeli attacks on the occupied territories and respect for the palestinian unity government but its hamass political wing that will have the final say earlier today israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu vowed to widen the attack on gaza if hamas rejects the ceasefire and if rocket fire continues prime minister benjamin netanyahu translated we agreed to the egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarization of the gaza strip from missiles from rockets and from tunnels through diplomatic means but if hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal as would now seem to be the case israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet amy goodman the threat of more violence follows a week that saw israel kill at least 192 palestinians in a massive bombing campaign on one of the worlds most densely populated areas the united nations estimates more than 80 percent of gazas dead are civilians including 36 children more than a thousand rockets from gaza have hit israel over the same period with just a fraction landing in urban areas around a dozen israelis have been wounded there have been no israelis reported killed for more were joined by amira hass shes the haaretz correspondent for the occupied palestinian territories the only israeli journalist to have spent years living in and reporting from gaza and the west bank she is joining us from ramallah amira hass can you talk about this latest development the egyptian proposal for a ceasefire israel accepting it hamas is weighing it amira hass yeah its exactly because hamas feels that this was a proposal boiled up with israel without any consultation with hamas and this is something thats forced on them and also reported through the media and not through negotiations or prior negotiations everybody knows that the leadership of egypt right now is an enemy of hamas an enemy of the muslim brothers and they feel humiliated and they feel that it is not meant to bring progress and change for the palestinians in gaza but to further marginalize them as a movement as a political movement aaron maté amira youve spoken to members of hamas youve interview them for haaretz what demands do they have for a ceasefire that they would respect amira hass their demands are of course to return first to the 2012 agreement or understanding that israel should open the crossings at least for goods and raw material and then allow people to leave through rafah they more or less neglected the idea i mean the hope that israel would allow palestinians leaving from erez from the northern west—northern gaza strip to the west bank this is something they have neglected but—or dont have much hope about this but at least for goods and raw materials and movement peoples movement through egypt this is one another thing that they say we see that israel always does not abide by its commitments and we need guarantees international guarantees that it does for next ceasefire because its time we find—have some understanding israel comes and has breaches—for example the fishermen it was agreed in 2012 the fishermen would be able to fish and not be shot at all whenever they move—i dont know—one kilometer away one maritime mile from the shore as israel does shoot at them things like that this is one another one of course is the release of all the prisoners that had been released in the last two three years within the shalit exchange of prisoners that israel in the past two months arrested most of them or many the great majority of them who are associated with hamas and there is a demand to release them again there is a demand to—yeah these are the basic demands there are other prisoners that israel—hamas prisoners hamas activists in the west bank political activists who have been arrested and they should also be released so these are very very—as i was told by somebody who is a great israel—an old opponent of hamas he said these demands are very very reasonable and even minimal we should even demand more we should demand more that israel does not fight for example the reconciliation government that it allows it to function we should demand that people move leave the west bank—leave gaza strip and be able to reconnect with the west bank so the demands the hamas demands are quite basic amy goodman so far amira hass here in the united states the coverage of the egyptian ceasefire proposal is that here is a ceasefire that israel says it will embrace it will stop the attack and hamas is probably going to reject it that is the story here in the united states that is being told amira hass yeah unfortunately just as the story has been told that israel was attacked and the palestinians are the aggressor and i mean we know—i dont remember which channel but there was this absurd report showing destruction of a palestinian home that was bombed by israel and it was said that this was an israeli home israeli house amy goodman that was diane sawyers report on abc showing a weeping palestinian mother in front of her destroyed home— amy goodman —and it said palestinians destroyed this israeli home amira hass inaudible but so far it seems that the international or at least the western community is not appalled by israels attack onslaught and as somebody told me if this is ok according to international law then there is something—something stinks with international law a senior diplomat told me that who does not succeed in convincing his government to have a clear stand against it now its true that according to international law palestinians also—the palestinian rockets are against international law and also targeting civilians and they succeeded they have succeeded hamas in inflicting fear among many many israelis and also in somehow ridiculing the israeli security establishment who boasted in the first two days that hamas has suffered a big blow a great blow which it hasnt i mean militarily speaking the great gain of hamas is that it has united—or israel actually has united also the opponents of hamas who are behind hamas the people see the ability of hamas and islamic jihad to launch missiles at israel toward israel while they are being attacked and so severely by such a strong military power its already an achievement and somebody told me its not about killing its about a message a message that we are not going—that if you expect palestinians to give up the struggle against the end of occupation you are mistaken this is how palestinians understand the missiles the launching of missiles its true that there are—also the international media gives a lot of—and also of course the israeli—gives a lot of prominence to demands of palestinians for revenge but this is not so much about the revenge as the feeling that one is standing up against israel and this is something that the palestinian authority has not done israel has been really humiliating the palestinian authority for so many years even though the palestinian authority has given so many—has had so many concessions and agreed with so many demands of the israeli government so people are weighing this one against the other and they even secular who really detest hamas ideology feel that right now hamas represented them in saying no we are not going to give up the struggle against occupation aaron maté amira and can you give us a rundown of what you see as israels goals here in this gaza conflict amira hass thats even more difficult every fight israel did everything possible to foil the very very weak reconciliation government which is not a unity government because hamas has left it so it does over and over what people say mistake but we think its not a mistake but it has had a policy for the past 20 years to disconnect gaza from the west bank it succeeded in it enormously and especially when hamas and fatah had split and created the two governments of the two territories gaza and the west bank but now when palestinians show signs that they understand that this is so much against their struggle this split between gaza and the west bank a split within the palestinian movement and they tried to change it israel comes and has to defend its main achievement of the past 20 years which was this separation between gaza and the west bank because the twostate solution is based on the not only assumption but on this principle that gaza and the west bank are the palestinian state alongside israel and israel has done everything possible to foil it from 93 94—actually since 91 so in essence this war again is in order to protect or to maintain this main achievement of israeli policy of the past 20 years in the past five six years both fatah and hamas played into the hands of the israel in that the hamas government did not think really about reconnecting with the west bank and the pa in ramallah really didnt care about gaza and made all kind of mistakes to let it go and create a vacuum there that hamas with full right filled in especially vacuum in the administration of gaza and now they tried to fix it because the results were publicdemanded popular demand mostly in gaza—i think in the west bank people do not—it has always been so people in the west bank feel very far away detached from gaza and we see these days during the attacks on gaza there isnt mobilization in the west bank to show the shock that people feel im sure they are but there isnt much movement except of some villages where villagers young people young men of also refugee camps go and clash with the army as a symbol of protest but this is the main—this is the main goal and of course the main goal is to maintain the occupation i mean to repress any opposition any resistance so the means change sometimes it is a mass arrest in the west bank and then a mass—i mean intensive colonization of what is left in the west bank or more construction and sometimes it is a negotiation process that leads nowhere and sometimes these are bloody attacks as we are experiencing now amy goodman amira hass we want to thank you for being with us haaretz correspondent for the occupied palestinian territories shes the only journalist to have spent—well she lived for 20 years in

Egyptian sources claim that its ceasefire initiative was based on consultations with Israel, the Palestinian Authority and all Palestinian factions, although this claim is denied by the Islamic organizations. The Israeli prime minister stated that if Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, it will be legitimate for Israel to broaden its military operation against the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"To avoid confusion and to be clear with our people, al-Qassam Brigades confirm that we haven't been contacted by any official or unofficial entities about terms of this alleged initiative,\" said the Azz a Din al Qassam brigades in a statement.\n\n\"If what has been circulated is true, this initiative means kneeling and submissiveness and so we\n\ncompletely refuse it and to us, it's not worth the ink used in writing it,\" the military organization added.\n\nSenior Islamic Jihad official Khalid al-Batsh welcomed Egypt's role, but said that there was only contact between Egypt and Israel. He stressed the Islamic Jihad was never consulted.\n\n\"Initiatives shouldn't be proposed through media outlets, but rather through the obvious channels, which are resistance factions and their leaders”, al-Batsh stated.\n\nDeputy secretary-general of the group, Ziad al-Nakhalah, said late Monday that there couldn't be a ceasefire agreement without guarantees to end Israeli aggression and the blockade on Gaza.\n\n\"We are open to any initiative, but rocket fire won't stop unless a real and appropriate agreement is reached,\" he added.\n\nIsrael's security cabinet on Tuesday accepted the Egyptian ceasefire proposal, a government spokesman said, after a week of deadly bombings on Gaza which killed over 180 Palestinians.\n\n\"The cabinet has decided to accept the Egyptian initiative for a ceasefire starting 9am today,\" Ofir Gendelman, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Twitter.\n\n\"We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarization of the (Gaza) Strip - from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels - through diplomatic means,\" he told reporters during an earlier press conference with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier.\n\nThe Prime Minister added, \"but if Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet.\"",

            "text": "Hamas’s rejection of the cease fire “gives Israel full legitimacy to expand the operation to protect our people,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday, after dozens of rockets hit Israel after the 9am start of the Egyptian-offered truce. Israel’s cabinet voted in favor of the truce, while Hamas’ military wing rejected the proposal.\n\n“We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarization of the (Gaza) Strip – from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels – through diplomatic means,” he told reporters during an earlier press conference with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier.\n\n“But if Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet.”\n\nHamas rejected the Egyptian proposal, saying Cairo did not consult the group over the deal. The organization’s armed wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, rejected the offer completely, saying it was “a surrender” and “wasn’t worth the ink it was written with.”\n\nAbout an hour after the cabinet agreed to the truce, Code Red sirens sounded in Ashkelon and nearby regional councils. Two rockets landed outside a community in Eshkol, and were followed by additional barrages of rockets.\n\nYisrael Beiteinu chairman, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, voted against accepting the ceasefire proposal, as did Bayit Yehudi leader Naftali Bennett. Voting in favor of the offer were Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, Finance Minister Yair Lapid, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and ministers Gilad Erdan and Yitzhak Aharonovich.\n\nEgyptian paper Al-Youm Al-Sabee purported to publish the details of the deal on Monday night. According to the report in Arabic, Israel will stop its aerial and naval attacks on Gaza, specifically refraining from any ground incursion into the Strip.\n\nHamas for their part will rein in the Palestinian factions, and work to put an end to all types of attacks on Israel, including by rockets, sea or even underground tunnels; specifically attacks on civilians and the border region between Gaza and Israel.\n\nAccording to the report, the two sides also agreed to increase the flow of goods into Gaza, as well as the gradual opening of the crossings into Gaza, in return for calm. However, further details regarding security arrangements are still supposed to be discussed.\n\n“If the offer is what was reported, then this is surrender. We’ll intensity our fight against the enemy,” the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades said in a statement.\n\nHamas spokesman Fauzi Barhum said that the Egyptian ceasefire offer was unacceptable. “A ceasefire without an agreement is out of the question. During a war, you don’t hold your fire and only then start negotiating,” he said.\n\nHamas official Osama Hamdan added the Egyptian initiative was a “joke.”\n\n“We did not receive this declared paper from the Egyptians … which means it’s an initiative for the media. It’s not a political initiative,” he told CNN.\n\nThe initiative was meant to “push the Palestinians into a corner and aid the Israelis.”\n\nHowever, Hamas didn’t close the door to negotiations on ending a week of fighting that killed at least 192 Palestinians and exposed millions of Israelis to rocket fire.\n\nThe militant group appeared to be holding out for better cease-fire conditions, with senior officials saying the current proposal offers no tangible achievements, particularly on easing a border blockade of Gaza enforced by Israel and Egypt.\n\nHamas also wants to be recognized by Egypt as a partner in any truce efforts. Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official in Gaza, said the movement was not consulted by Egypt.\n\n“We did not receive any official draft of this Egyptian proposal,” he said, adding that the plan, as is, was “not acceptable.”\n\nHamas officials are weary of promises by Egypt and Israel to ease the border blockade. Such promises were also part of a truce that ended more than a week of fighting in 2012, but were quickly broken as violence flared again.\n\nIsraeli government spokesman Mark Regev warned that Israel would strike Gaza even harder if Hamas does not accept the truce.\n\n“If Hamas rejects the Egyptian proposal, if Hamas continues to shoot rockets at Israeli cities, we are prepared to continue our military operation and intensify it as needed to protect our people,” he said.\n\nRoi Kais, Attila Somfalvi, Meir Ohayon, Eli Senyor and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Israel has agreed to a ceasefire proposal to end a week of deadly, cross-border fire with the Gaza Strip, but the plan appears doomed after Palestinian militants rejected it.\n\nThe proposal, put together by Egypt, involves the cessation of attacks by both sides and the opening of border crossings from today, while negotiations are held on other details.\n\nHigh-level delegations from Israel and the Palestinian factions would hold separate talks in Cairo within 48 hours to consolidate the ceasefire with \"confidence-building measures\".\n\nAt Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, the security cabinet convened by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu voted to approve the truce deal.\n\nMr Netanyahu said Israel saw in the deal an opportunity to strip the Palestinian enclave of rockets but is prepared to redouble military action there if the cross-border launches persist.\n\n\"We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarisation of the Strip - from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels - through diplomatic means,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"But if Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet.\"\n\nIsrael has mobilised tens of thousands of troops for a threatened Gaza invasion if the rocket salvoes persist.\n\n\"We still have the possibility of going in, under cabinet authority, and putting and end to them (the rockets),\" said Amos Gilad, a senior Israeli defence official and envoy to Cairo.\n\nBut Hamas has reportedly rejected the proposal, and says it only learned of the plan in the media.\n\nSami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, repeated its position that demands it has made must be met before it lays down its weapons.\n\nHamas wants Israeli restrictions on the authorised crossing for food and building materials between Israel and Gaza lifted, and it wants hundreds of its members who have been detained by Israel to be freed.\n\nHamas's armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, rejected the reported text of the truce deal, saying: \"Our battle with the enemy continues and will increase in ferocity and intensity.\"\n\nPalestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, who reached an agreement with Hamas in April that led to the formation of a unity government last month, welcomed the proposal and urged its acceptance.\n\nGaza-based militants fired more than 100 rockets into Israel on Monday, according to the Israeli military, while Israel kept up its air and naval bombardments of the Gaza Strip.\n\nGaza health officials say Israeli attacks have so far killed at least 180 Palestinians and wounded more than 1,300, most of them civilians.\n\nHamas rocket attacks have been regularly intercepted but more than half a dozen Israelis have been wounded since the start of the week-old offensive.\n\nThe frequent rocket salvoes have disrupted life as air raid sirens sent people in much of the country racing to shelters.\n\nAn Israeli official today said the nation has found funding for three new Iron Dome rocket interception batteries\n\nIsrael had seven Iron Domes set up to shoot down missiles when cross-border fighting with Hamas-led militants surged on July 8, and has since brought two more into service, Israel's Defence Ministry said.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, the Israeli official said that as a result of the Gaza crisis, three new Iron Dome units were now \"in the pipeline\".",

through 1 on january 1516 2013 a reported 100106 people were killed in the farming town of basatin alhaswiyeh orchards of haswiyeh or just haswiyeh arabic Ø§ÙØ­ØµÙÙØ© meaning gravel for more on the name see talk page on the northern edge of the central syrian city of homs locatable here on wikimapia and here on google maps its dominated by orchards and small fields with only about 1500 residents plus refugees from other areas surely reduced now as the story was first announced by opposition sources via the world media the massacre was of whole families as many as 13 of them including 32 from one specific sunni family the victims were reportedly shot slashed and whatnot and then burnt in their homes not surprisingly the killers are reported as alawites and shiites from surrounding villages for the first time its being alleged this is part of a strategy of creating an alawiteshiitechristian breakaway state purified of sunnis in advance see sectarian claims this was all conveyed by oppositionrebel sources by phone and internet to the outside world but quickly a competing set of reports emerged from mainstream british news outlets interviewing people living with the aftermath in busatin alhaswiyeh as well as local official sources these suggestemphatically that the assailants and killers were rebels dressed blacker than usual possibly from jabhat alnusrah see locals blame alnusrah activists speak the uk daily telegraph cited opposition sources from homs who blamed loyalist militiamen backed by government troops for the attack which featured torching houses and slashing victims to death with knives ukbased syrian observatory for human rights sohr said whole families were executed with one family losing up to 32 members including women and children 2 cnn heard from antigovernment activist abu rami that 13 families all of them sunni were killed in husweyeh rami also blamed the massacre on in part a lack of nato bombing 3 james miller at enduring america has assembled a collection of news items and analysis on this incident one feature is a detailed facebook post from homs uptodate citing 105 victims in part reports emerging from husweyeh massacre behold such intolerable pain of an extremely appalling massacre committed against 13 families according to eyewitnesses on tuesday 1512013 the regimes military security forces entered the village 1200 pm syria time and arbitrarily arrested a number of men at 1 pm some captives were released and at 2 pm six buses with shabiha and security forces arrived and parked near al boushi factory for ceramics they began their hunt for various sunni families and killed their members where they found them including hiding in trees this continued for an unspecified span apparently though the night and into the next day pillage and rape were apparently involved by this account most of the eyewitnesses recounts said that the gold women were wearing was robbed after they were disgustingly humiliated whilst others were kidnappedarrested and no one know anything about them nor about how many are they 4 telegraph haswiyeh is not far from the region of houla where 108 people were killed over two days last may the un described the houla killings as a war crime perpetrated by the government forces and shabiha militia backing assads regime 2 the towns proximity to alhoula site of the houla massacre is often mentioned as helping to suggest the government is responsible clicking that link might be instructive sectarian claimsbreakaway state the massacre in alhaswiyeh and the widelymentioned one in alhoula plus others are now alleged to be part of a broad government strategy the common patterns of allegations appear again here the telegraph reported waleed alfares an activist in the area said that most of the victims were sunnis and that many of the attackers came from the nearby village of mazraa which he said is predominantly shia 2 more than usual there is talk of who was spared and why homs uptodate the village includes sunnis christians and alawties but the massacre is proven to be purely driven by sectarianism since all the families massacred are sunni families only 4 cnn rami said the families killed were sunnis suggesting that the killers were motivated by sect differences sunnis christians and alawites in the village were spared he said 3 aps bassem mroue and zeina karam pulled this together with other activist claims into the spectacular genocidal grand strategy behind these patterns sweep of majority sunni village could pave way for alawite enclave the opposition believes the mass killings that have occurred mostly in overwhelmingly sunni villages that lie near main routes into the alawite sects coastal strip are meant to lay the groundwork for a breakaway enclave 5 where the alleged aqrab massacre in the same area fits into that strategy is unclear by combined implication this breakaway state will not be just a greater latakia for the alawites but for other shia christians and apparently everyone but sunnis but to get it they need to liquidate the local sunnis in the same kind of fits and spurts countrybased rebels could pull off if they wanted the implications are clearly troubling and also troubling in less clear ways locals blame alnusrah brits speak to locals not one but two british news teams swiftly brought some questions into the mix ala alex thomsons pioneering approach most journalists gather their reports by phone from activists and from available sources note that they cant verify anything and use the standard fallacies to explain that its the syrian governments fault in contrast itvs international editor bill neely and a team visited the town given as basatin al huwaisa just as news broke on thursday january 17 homs has been the scene of several massacres he would write more than one has been contested as one side blames the other for the atrocity this is yet another 1 bbcs chief international correspondent lyse doucet headed a team that arrived on friday the 18th 6 this is a war crime she would quip but who committed it came through less clearly than it did in the standard sohrtype reports what they heard from soldiers authorities and most importantly from presumably genuine local civilians was completely at odds with what activists had been saying the men who approached neely told him the attack was by rebel fighters but the fighters were different from before they wore black uniforms and had headbands with jihadi slogans most but not all were syrians they felt one attacker witness said they were from jabhat al nusra the governor of homs province ahmad moneir mohammed also said the attackers were with the alnusrah front 1 lyse doucet heard the same soldiers who escorted the team to the area said hundreds of men from a militant islamist rebel group the alnusra front committed the killings of course they would say that some would observe the local support was there one woman told the bbc the same the main article passed on 6 but another bbc article from the 19th more directly from doucet herself noted others in the village confirmed the armys account 7 note the difference between singular and plural the other side emerges bbcs lyse doucet was able to salvage some doubts about the picture she saw which have been amplified successfully by others and helped neutralize the effects of this reporting soldiers mainly were cited as the source with a local or locals passingly mentioned as supporting it more attention was given to the lone dissenter but out of earshot of the official syrian minders another woman said the army was present at the time and that some soldiers even apologised for the murders saying others had acted without orders 6 this serves to underscore the very real but easy to overrate ambiguity that comes from the presence of government soldiers and apparently minders it cant really be known whether that second woman is a window onto the truth in a town of enforced lies or if shes a representative of the lie establishment standing out in an area where truth prevails doucets second report enforces the singularity others in the village confirmed the armys account but one woman who spoke to us offcamera said otherwise 7 a new york times report by anne barnard managed to more than invert the witness situation laid out above she ignored neelys unambiguous itv report and mentioned only the bbcs slightly mixed report which comes through quite differently soldiers escorting the bbc journalists blamed the extremist group jabhet alnusra for the killings while out of earshot of the soldiers villagers blamed the army and said some soldiers had apologized for the killings 8 errors no locals are cited as supporting the soldiers the one disagreeing with them is transformed to more than one and those are given as implicitly representatives of all villagers this constitutes a serious distortion that turns the established record almost completely on end its made to seem that even ontheground reporting of the kind nyt reuters ap and almost everyone else avoids still manages to support the initial activist version but thats simply not true doucets report managed to set the stage quite well for this mistreatment being in touch with the alnusrah front the bbc had gotten a denial that they refrain from killing civilians both sides say they do she notes but one is lying here when the offcamera woman speaks and implicates the soldiers the broll footage they chose was of burned remains and then soldiers their boots and rifles as a reminder then she reminds us over footage of some charred bodies that activists say this was the work of progovernment militia known as shabiha some day well know for certain who did this a war crime happened here 6 emphasis in original the someday is presumably in the inevitable future period called postassad the activists will probably be proven correct here and everywhere else punished for helping or not helping rebel attacks as for the purpose of the raid neely was told the men in black had come to use the town for an attack on the military intelligence headquarters nearby he was shown one of the massacre homes to support this local men say a woman and five children were killed there they say rebels in black uniforms had come to the house and wanted to use the roof to attack the base many of the locals had refused at that point say the men they were shot the bodies of the women and children were burned i saw blood on the floor a room where there had been a fire and human remains the childrens clothes were hanging on a washing line 1 one opposition activist gave reuters a totally inverted version of that claim on the 19th locals were killed by the militaryshabiha for allowing rebels to use their homes in the past he said abu yazen an opposition activist in homs said the rebel free syrian army occasionally entered the farmland of basatin alhasawiya to attack a nearby military academy assads forces punish civilians for allowing the rebels to enter the area he said other activists said the raid was carried out by proassad militia 9 questioning the alnusrah id one woman seen on video retelling her story in arabic in neelys itv news report is said to fail to identify the killers describing them only as armed men the armed men killed my three children she says they came at night i couldnt tell who they were were just farmers now we have nothing 1 this is unusual all other survivorswitnessesinformed sources are quite clear who they believe the killers were that theyd be hard to see at night makes most sense if they were wearing black although she doesnt specify that presented with the conflict between shabiha or rebel terrorists the everinventive james miller at enduring america tried rejecting both miller speculated that other parties dressed as alnusrah to trick people carried out the killings the identity of the attackers may have been confused depending on who saw them its possible that the attackers were meant to look like jabhat al nusra but he noted that the described outfit with islamistslogan headband is hardly a positive identification and in fact doesnt sound exactly like their known costume style he raised the possibility that al nusra has been framed either by other rebels as he says neely suggests or by lebanese men perhaps from hezbollah as one unverified source claimed as support he pointed out there is more evidence of larger numbers of hezbollah working in homs than jabhat al nusra 4 even if this is true unverified hard for anyone to really know it ignores the swathes of coutryside to the north and west where rebels and sunni islamists have numerous held towns to base attacks from in case this falseflag notion has any merit and its worth at least brief consideration there are a few inherent problems first there was no black flag cited the best clue to fighting under the flag of alnusrah especially in a fake operation to that end the claims that it was them seem to be guesses perhaps to tap into known antialqaeda sentiment the fighters might have never even claimed that and were just some other dark jihadists furthermore activist reports didnt mention how they saw through any such ruse to tag the true killers and dont even mention the ruse at all they said that busedin shabiha and security forces not the same disguised as alnusrah carried out the killlings either their sources didnt see the blackclad killers in action or there were no no such people they wore otherregular clothing or there were black outfits on the killers but the activists blackclad sources chose not to mention it the reported victims massacre vs battle deaths a tweet from the 17th by journalist zaid benjamin said breaking over 180 people killed during 3 days of assad troops operations in hasawayah town in homs syrian activist abu jaafar 4 nothing else supports such a high number with 106 being the most common a tally perhaps not final of 100 was cited by youssef alhomsi an activist based in homs who spoke to the telegraph he had a list ready of exactly 100 names including 15 women and 10 children 2 that is his list of killed families was of 75 men this would suggest as with tremseh or qubeir a smaller rebel massacre of maybe 3045 civilians mostly of one family then many battle dead from after the army responded even if we take the smaller portion as families why so many women 15 and so few children 10 it could be that rebels count adults from a young age 13 or 14 so some girls are women and some boys among the 75 men adjusted then that 100 might be better read an example 12 women 15 civilian men 18 children and 55 battle dead perhaps including government troops killed but mostly rebel fighters neelys report brought back supports for that interpretation only dozens were massacred by the blackclad militants with a common figure of around 30 the governor mohammed stated that there had been killings civilians had died four children and four women he thought as well as men who had been killed in fighting between the army and rebels a commander told neely there had been fighting for days by the 17th they have killed rebels he said but not civilians not deliberately anyway though they can be hit in the middle of a battle he said that would clearly be irrelevant to the charges in question 1 however this interpretation with only 3040 does not jibe at all with the opposition claims of 13 familes one family with 32 killed and large numbers suggested from others this is worth a subsection arrests the assault on haswiyeh was accompanied by arrests of some number of people falling into three categories of unknown size some of them were released according to homs uptodate cited by enduring america and some killed two captives are named there abdul haseeb deyab was killed another prisoner was imam of al tayyar mosque in husweyyeh village or so someone said anyway he was likely among those releasednot killed probably a stanch sunni who blames nonsunnis for the massacre homs uptodate also mentioned a third category of those who were taken away by the killers perhaps dead by now but unknown others were kidnappedarrested and no one know anything about them nor about how many are they 4 neelys crew was shown two alleged rebel supporters arrested in the raids following the massacre the two men are paraded out blindfolded apparently beaten and acting very frightened even in front of the camera they are abused a guard is seen burning one of the mens fingers with a cigarette to keep him from locking his hands behind his back its a troubling sequence neely is told the men had been found with a m16 rifle americanmade 1 some like eas james miller fairly point out this overlyobvious american model is the perfect choice to frame someone with if one wanted to accuse them of being a foreign agent 4 stricken families as reported reuters reported on the 19th from the sohr a set of three families two unnamed suggesting that at least 63 of the victims came from these alone unless the 14 including 3 is the same in error as the one of 17 activists said 17 members of the khazam family had been killed during tuesdays raid on basatin alhasawiya the observatory has the names of 14 members of one family including three children and information on other families who were completely killed including one of 32 people rami abdelrahman head of the observatory told reuters 9 that would make 46 actually reported by sohr neely speaking to nonrebel locals was given the names of families who had been killed including at least members of the the hamza family the khoulis and ghalouls 1 thats four families named homs uptodate cited a fifth family deyab as taking special hits among those first arrested a number of men were martyr abdul haseeb deyab some were released but not apparently martyr deyab then a abu mashhour shehab deyabs house hosted the burning of some young men who were extrajudicially executed in other houses and then burnt in his house then on the al deyab farmlands they also executed the whole family and burnt their corpses numbers not specified 4 homs uptodate also cited al mahbani family with farmlands right beside al deyab farmlands where they killed more than 17 members and finally the al ghaloul family â mentioned to neely had their orchards raided they say by the shabihatypes who executed all the men women and children they found from that family 4 bodies tied to trees several claims from both sides of the divide over blame jointly suggest some kind of grisly death in the orchards outside of town where bodies were left to rot homs uptodate related a few of the young men were able to escape as they climbed on trees and hid in orchards but the regimes shabiha thugs caught them executed them and tied them to trees 4 james miller at enduring america citing this report made this unusual observation that manages to reject both competing versions and propose a third explanation casting the sensationalism of the bodiesintrees claim as evidence against itself a problem was immediately apparent the claims made by some activists included beheadings knife attacks and summary executions but the evidence did not show any of this instead it was obvious that the villages had been heavily bombed likely by aircraft but possibly by tanks and artillery and the reports of knifewielding shabiha and bodies hanging in trees were exaggerated 4 however summary inhome executions are clearly evidenced and there remains no evidence or claim of tanks and fighter jet attacks both sides blame upclose slashandburn massacres but there is supporting evidence for executed bodies in the orchards if not necessarily strung up on trees itvs bill neely reported on meeting the local men it became clear many people had been killed in the streets in houses and in orchards the bodies of those in houses and streets had been removed but the orchard was in the open and snipers were still firing bodies were still there they said 1 he specified i did not see any bodies but he didnt seem to doubt the claim there is a sick and compelling logic to tying victims visibly to trees inviting loved ones to recover them and then sniping anyone who tries but no one has specifically proposed that yet and the whole bodiesintheorchards substory remains unclear crime scene clues macro town level james miller passed on from a discussion with bill neely of itv that the river divides the village half of which the rebels control and the other half of which the military controls the rebels use the orchards and nearby homes to attack the intelligence headquarters to the east 4 wikimapia has an entry for Ø§ÙØ­ØµÙÙØ© that highlights a broad area including a small patch of builtup streets like both video reports show this must be the half the government can bring them to the near east side and the northcenter anyway see more detailed map below and theres the much larger area of scattered homes set amongst orchards the town part stops at the orontes river as shown on the inset map with the green stretch residing mostly across it to the west and southwest wikimapia and visual common sense indicate as shown here the military intelacademyartillery basearmy terrain area is to the west of town not the east nearer the orchard half the attacks werewould be launched from doucet had soldiers corroborated by locals who said hundreds of men had entered the village from adjoining fields 7 to the south is more orchards and the bulk of homs to the west and north are city areas probably under government control so the direction of entry is most likely from the northwest where orchards soon yield to fields and a bit off to places like arrastan alhoula aqrab mazraaf halfaya etc where hundreds of rebels can gather and act at a time theyd have to cross the highway and over or very near the army terrain to get into haswiyehs orchards but otherwise its small town fields and backroads all the way from their closest known hotbed of taldou 20 km northwest as support for that rebels said the killers came in the opposite way the east end of town closer to governmentcontrolled homs has a factory of some sort with piles of perhaps clayrich soil scrapedup nearby this might well be the al boushi factory for ceramics cited by homs uptodate as the shabiha killer congregation point its next to the mosque and was recently built appearing on satellite images as a construction site in 2011 and as complete in early 2012 the square tower went up early over a pit some underground firing area apparently both itv and bbc teams were escorted in from the east on a road right to a tower of this factory area the grounds are also where neely and his local witnesses walked and talked the same tower visible the base from which the army escorted both journalist teams is at the other end of that road in an unsure location it was apparently at or near the massive sugar refinery the proximity of that to the alleged massacre parking lot will not be lost on some and thats likely why the activists said the killers came in that way the killing locations are of course a clue and they tend to support the locals not the activists doucet says in her bbc report most of the killings took place in houses down this hill with a heavily treelined dirt road sloping down to a walled complex of large redroofed buildings that would put the kill area on the west end of town here on gm 6 circled in red belowthe northwest end of town it would seem the rebels could have entered this nearest part of town with more scatted peopleresistance crossing where the river is at its narrowest and a crossing through a building lays nearby they would most likely be on foot at this point and dragging the bodies back would be a hassle as for the other version these homes are clear across haswiyeh from the possible ceramics factory for the armyshabihashiitehezbollah killers in the activist story this would require a drive of at most 033 km frompast the sugar plant parking the buses there at the east edge of town as reported and then a walk of the same distance or more through town when there is a perfectly drivable road all the way there how many of the killings and abductions were in the rebelheld orchards and homes across the way is unclear many lived there with even less concentration and presumably less protection some people say some of them wound up tied to the trees they tried to hide in see above micro home level as mentioned above bill neelys itv crew was shown a home where it was said a woman and her five young children the oldest seven were killed after refusing to let the rebels have the roof they were burnt in a sideroom the locals said and that room had clearly been burned thoroughly with a lesscharred blanket where one of the bodies had been in the outer room next to it laundry hangs on a line and an empty clothes basket lies in a puddle of blood on the linoleum floor with a smear showing where the victim was the dragged away in that spot however a man possibly a rebel fighter was killed syrian private broadcaster addounia tv showed the scene in a report of jan 17 before his body was removed the nature of his injuries and cause of death are unclear third image below 10 they show the same charred room to the side itv was shown itv news shows the burn room in the home where locals say a woman and her children were murdered local men show itv a pool of blood in that home the man previously in that spot addounia tv its not certain where the home neely was shown is located but most or all of his exterior shots seem to be on the east edge of town or in the open areas right next to it bbcs doucet took a foray much further in due west to the top of the hill overlooking the bad place at the far end of town only by a safer roundabout route northern presumably did soldiers get her up closer to where some victims charred ones only had still not been removed she had just said that the soldiers said they had already removed the bodies and this was the 18th at least two days after the killings 7 this and the fact that bodies were left behind and not reclaimed by the hypothetical rebel killers who usually do truck away and copiously videorecord the victims they frequently find are both interesting aspects of this case worth considering the buildings she shows seem to be in the compound in the north half of the redcircled area above exact buildings perhaps will be proposed at right a sample scene of victims she said seemed to have been killed while trying to flee the fuel bottle was left behind in total she saw at least three scenes where bodies were or had been which she described as within two family compounds one body in the doorway and one a bit outside it were seen at one house as shown in the inset image above another building was gutted by fire and had a few charred bodies inside another spot with no burning was a kitchen with long blood smears on the floor which suggested at least two bodies were dragged away poignantly she wondered had people been hiding in the cupboards 7 a less verifiable rebel video posted january 16 shows 18 seconds of the interior of a large home charred and jumbled with what seems to be two charred bodies the cameraman is sobbing loudly as he films suggesting its his own home or that were to believe that it was online and available to activists like the posters here sham syrian news network on the 16th after the massacres ended perhaps before the fighting and a day before news flashes were going out 11 world reaction french foreign ministry spokesman vincent floreani said on thursday jan 17 that the killings at alhaswiyeh were new proof of the savagery of president bashar alassads regime 12 saudi gazette reported a homsbased activist who identified himself as abu bilal said via the internet that the killings are a stain on the worlds conscience 12 the syrian observatory for human rights urged the un to send a factfinding mission as quoted by the afp observatory member rami abdelrahman said this needs to be investigated by the united nations 13 the sohrs facebook page said we urge the office of the un high commissioner for human rights to send an international investigation team to homs immediately so as to investigate and fully document the massacre in order to bring all those responsible to justice 14 this is unlikely to happen in part for reasons the sohr is familiar with asking for a similar investigation of killings in ras alayn they said we also bring to the uns attention that they can not refuse to send a mission by using the syrian authorities refusal as an excuse since the regime has no control whatsoever on that part of syria 15 that excuse would probably work in governmentheld homs and would likely be cited if any explicit refusal to investigate is ever issued unicef issued a nonspecific statement on the incident on january 20 media reports today friday from the scene of mass killings in the village of hasawiya

            "text": "From A Closer Look On Syria\n\nOn January 15/16, 2013, a reported 100-106 people were killed in the farming town of Basatin Al-Haswiyeh (Orchards of Haswiyeh) or just Haswiyeh (Arabic الحصوية, meaning \"gravel\"). (for more on the name, see talk page) On the northern edge of the central Syrian city of Homs (locatable here on Wikimapia and here on Google maps), it's dominated by orchards and small fields, with only about 1,500 residents, plus refugees from other areas, surely reduced now.\n\nAs the story was first announced by opposition sources via the world media, the massacre was of \"whole families,\" as many as 13 of them, including 32 from one specific (Sunni) family. The victims were reportedly shot, slashed, and whatnot and then burnt in their homes. Not surprisingly, the killers are reported as Alawites and Shi'ites from surrounding villages. For the first time, it's being alleged this is part of a strategy of creating an Alawite/Shi'ite/Christian breakaway state, purified of Sunnis in advance (see Sectarian Claims. This was all conveyed by opposition/rebel sources by phone and internet to the outside world.\n\nBut quickly, a competing set of reports emerged, from mainstream British news outlets interviewing people living with the aftermath in Busatin Al-Haswiyeh (as well as local official sources). These suggest-emphatically - that the assailants and killers were rebels, dressed blacker than usual, possibly from Jabhat al-Nusrah. (see Locals Blame Al-Nusrah)\n\nThe UK Daily Telegraph cited \"opposition sources from Homs\" who blamed \"loyalist militiamen backed by government troops\" for the attack, which featured \"torching houses and slashing victims to death with knives.\" UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said \"whole families were executed\", with one family losing up to 32 members, including women and children. [2] CNN heard, from \"anti-government activist Abu Rami,\" that \"13 families,\" all of them Sunni, were killed in \"Husweyeh.\" (Rami also blamed the massacre on, in part, a lack of NATO bombing). [3]\n\nJames Miller at Enduring America has assembled a collection of news items and analysis on this incident. One feature is a detailed Facebook post from \"Homs Up-To-Date,\" citing 105 victims. In part:\n\nAt 1 PM some captives were released, and at 2 PM six buses with Shabiha and security forces arrived \"and parked near Al Boushi factory for ceramics.\" They began their hunt for various Sunni families and killed their members where they found them, including hiding in trees. This continued for an unspecified span, apparently though the night and into the next day. Pillage and rape were apparently involved, by this account:\n\nTelegraph: \"Haswiyeh is not far from the region of Houla, where 108 people were killed over two days last May. The UN described the Houla killings as a war crime perpetrated by the government forces and shabiha militia backing Assad's regime.\" [2] The town's proximity to Al-Houla, site of the Houla massacre is often mentioned as helping to suggest the government is responsible. Clicking that link might be instructive.\n\nThe massacre in Al-Haswiyeh and the widely-mentioned one in Al-Houla, plus others, are now alleged to be part of a broad government strategy. The common patterns of allegations appear again here: The Telegraph reported \"Waleed al-Fares, an activist in the area said that most of the victims were Sunnis and that many of the attackers came from the nearby village of Mazraa, which he said is predominantly Shia. [2]\n\nMore than usual, there is talk of who was spared and why. Homs Up-to-Date: \"The village includes Sunnis, Christians, and Alawties, but the massacre is proven to be purely driven by sectarianism since all the families massacred are Sunni families only....\" [4] CNN: \"Rami said the families killed were Sunnis, suggesting that the killers were motivated by sect differences. Sunnis, Christians and Alawites in the village were spared, he said.\" [3]\n\nAP's Bassem Mroue and Zeina Karam pulled this together with other activist claims into the spectacular, genocidal, grand strategy behind these patterns: \"Sweep of majority Sunni village could pave way for Alawite enclave\"\n\nBy combined implication, this breakaway state will not be just a greater Latakia for the Alawites, but for other Shia, Christians, and apparently everyone but Sunnis. But to get it, they need to liquidate the local Sunnis, in the same kind of fits and spurts country-based rebels could pull off, if they wanted. The implications are clearly troubling, and also troubling in less clear ways.\n\nNot one, but two British news teams swiftly brought some questions into the mix, a-la Alex Thomson's pioneering approach. Most journalists gather their reports by phone from activists and from available sources, note that they can't verify anything, and use the standard fallacies to explain that it's the Syrian government's fault. In contrast, ITV's international editor Bill Neely and a team visited the town (given as \"Basatin al Huwaisa\") just as news broke on Thursday, January 17. \"Homs has been the scene of several massacres,\" he would write. \"More than one has been contested, as one side blames the other for the atrocity. This is yet another.\" [1] BBC's Chief International Correspondent, Lyse Doucet, headed a team that arrived on Friday, the 18th. [6] \"This is a war crime,\" she would quip. But who committed it came through less clearly than it did in the standard SOHR-type reports.\n\nWhat they heard from soldiers, authorities, and most importantly from presumably genuine local civilians, was completely at odds with what activists had been saying. The men who approached Neely told him the attack was by rebel fighters, but \"the fighters were different from before. They wore \"black uniforms\" and had headbands with Jihadi slogans.\" Most, but not all, were Syrians, they felt. \"One [attacker? witness?] said they were from Jabhat al Nusra.\" The Governor of Homs province, Ahmad Moneir Mohammed, also said the attackers were with the Al-Nusrah front. [1]\n\nLyse Doucet heard the same: \"Soldiers who escorted the team to the area said hundreds of men from a militant Islamist rebel group, the al-Nusra Front, committed the killings.\" Of course they would say that, some would observe. The local support was there. \"One woman told the BBC the same,\" the main article passed on. [6] But another BBC article from the 19th, more directly from Doucet herself, noted \"others in the village confirmed the army's account.\" [7] Note the difference between singular and plural.\n\nBBC's Lyse Doucet was able to salvage some doubts about the picture she saw, which have been amplified successfully by others and helped neutralize the effects of this reporting. Soldiers, mainly, were cited as the source, with a local or locals passingly mentioned as supporting it. More attention was given to the lone dissenter.\n\nThis serves to underscore the very real (but easy to overrate) ambiguity that comes from the presence of government soldiers (and apparently \"minders.\") It can't really be known whether that second woman is a window onto the truth in a town of enforced lies. or if she's a representative of the lie establishment standing out in an area where truth prevails. Doucet's second report enforces the singularity: \"Others in the village confirmed the army's account. But one woman, who spoke to us off-camera\" said otherwise. [7]\n\nA New York Times report by Anne Barnard managed to more than invert the witness situation laid out above. She ignored Neely's unambiguous ITV report and mentioned only the BBC's slightly mixed report, which comes through quite differently:\n\nErrors: No locals are cited as supporting the soldiers, the one disagreeing with them is transformed to more than one, and those are given as, implicitly, representatives of all villagers. This constitutes a serious distortion that turns the established record almost completely on end. It's made to seem that even on-the-ground reporting (of the kind NYT, Reuters, AP, and almost everyone else avoids) still manages to support the initial activist version. But that's simply not true.\n\nDoucet's report managed to set the stage quite well for this mistreatment. Being in touch with the Al-Nusrah front, the BBC had gotten a denial, that they refrain from killing civilians. Both sides say they do, she notes, but one is lying here. When the off-camera woman speaks and implicates the soldiers, the b-roll footage they chose was of burned remains and then soldiers, their boots and rifles, as a reminder. Then she reminds us, over footage of some charred bodies, that \"activists say this was the work of pro-government militia known as Shabiha. Some day, we’ll know for certain who did this. A war crime happened here.\" [6] (emphasis in original). The someday is presumably in the inevitable future period called \"Post-Assad.\" The activists will probably be \"proven\" correct here and everywhere else.\n\nAs for the purpose of the raid, Neely was told the men in black had come to use the town for an attack on the military intelligence headquarters nearby. He was shown one of the massacre homes to support this:\n\nOne opposition activist gave Reuters a totally inverted version of that claim on the 19th; locals were killed by the military/Shabiha for allowing rebels to use their homes in the past. He said:\n\nOne woman seen on video retelling her story in Arabic, in Neely’s ITV news report, is said to fail to identify the killers, describing them only as armed men. \"The armed men killed my three children, she says. They came at night. I couldn't tell who they were. We're just farmers. Now we have nothing.\" [1] This is unusual; all other survivors/witnesses/informed sources are quite clear who they believe the killers were. That they'd be hard to see at night makes most sense if they were wearing black, although she doesn't specify that.\n\nPresented with the conflict between Shabiha or rebel terrorists, the ever-inventive James Miller at Enduring America tried rejecting both. Miller speculated that other parties, dressed as al-Nusrah to trick people, carried out the killings. \"The identity of the attackers may have been confused, depending on who saw them ... it's possible that the attackers were meant to look like Jabhat al Nusra.” But he noted that the described outfit with Islamist-slogan headband “is hardly a positive identification,” and in fact doesn’t sound exactly like their known costume style. He raised the possibility that “Al Nusra has been framed,” either by other rebels (as he says Neely suggests) or by “Lebanese men, perhaps from Hezbollah” as one unverified source claimed. As support, he pointed out “there is more evidence of larger numbers of Hezbollah working in Homs than Jabhat al Nusra.” [4] Even if this is true (unverified, hard for anyone to really know), it ignores the swathes of coutryside to the north and west where rebels and Sunni Islamists have numerous held towns to base attacks from.\n\nIn case this false-flag notion has any merit - and it’s worth at least brief consideration - there are a few inherent problems. First, there was no black flag cited, the best clue to fighting under the flag of Al-Nusrah (especially in a fake operation to that end). The claims that it was them seem to be guesses, perhaps to tap into known anti-Al-Qaeda sentiment. The fighters might have never even claimed that, and were just some other dark Jihadists.\n\nFurthermore, activist reports didn’t mention how they saw through any such ruse to tag the true killers, and don’t even mention the ruse at all. They said that bused-in Shabiha and security forces, not the same disguised as Al-Nusrah, carried out the killlings. Either their sources didn’t see the black-clad killers in action, or there were no no such people (they wore other/regular clothing), or there were black outfits on the killers, but the activists' (black-clad?) sources chose not to mention it.\n\nA tweet from the 17th by journalist Zaid Benjamin said \"#BREAKING: Over 180 people killed during 3 days of Assad troops operations in Hasawayah town in Homs - Syrian Activist Abu Ja'afar.\" [4] Nothing else supports such a high number, with 106 being the most common. A tally, perhaps not final, of 100 was cited by \"Youssef al-Homsi, an activist based in Homs\" who spoke to the Telegraph. He had a list ready of exactly 100 names, \"including 15 women and 10 children.\" [2]That is, his list of \"killed families\" was of 75% men. This would suggest, as with Tremseh or Qubeir, a smaller rebel massacre of maybe 30-45 civilians, mostly of one family, then many battle dead from after the army responded. Even if we take the smaller portion as families, why so many women (15) and so few children (10)? It could be that rebels count adults from a young age (13 or 14), so some girls are women, and some boys among the 75 men. Adjusted, then, that 100 might be better read (an example): 12 women, 15 civilian men, 18 children, and 55 battle dead (perhaps including government troops killed, but mostly rebel fighters)\n\nNeely's report brought back supports for that interpretation. Only \"dozens\" were massacred by the black-clad militants, with a \"common figure\" of \"around 30\" The governor, Mohammed, \"stated that there had been killings. Civilians had died; four children and four women, he thought, as well as men who had been killed in fighting between the army and rebels.\" A commander told Neely there had been fighting for \"days\" by the 17th. \"They have killed rebels, he said. But not civilians, not deliberately anyway, though they can be hit in the middle of a battle, he said.\" That would clearly be irrelevant to the charges in question. [1]\n\nHowever, this interpretation with only 30-40 does not jibe at all with the opposition claims of 13 familes, one family with 32 killed, and large numbers suggested from others. This is worth a sub-section.\n\nThe assault on Haswiyeh was accompanied by arrests of some number of people, falling into three categories of unknown size. Some of them were released, according to Homs Up-To-Date (cited by Enduring America), and some killed. Two captives are named there; Abdul Haseeb Deyab was killed. Another prisoner was “Imam of Al Tayyar mosque in Husweyyeh village,” or so someone said anyway. He was likely among those released/not killed, probably a stanch Sunni who blames non-Sunnis for the massacre. Homs Up-To-Date also mentioned a third category of those who were taken away by the killers, perhaps dead by now but unknown. \"others were kidnapped/arrested and no one know anything about them nor about how many are they.\" [4]\n\nNeely's crew was shown two alleged rebel supporters arrested in the raids following the massacre. The two men are paraded out, blindfolded, apparently beaten, and acting very frightened. Even in front of the camera, they are abused; a guard is seen burning one of the men's fingers with a cigarette to keep him from locking his hands behind his back. It's a troubling sequence. Neely is told the men had been found with a M-16 rifle, American-made. [1] Some, like EA's James Miller, fairly point out this overly-obvious American model is the perfect choice to frame someone with, if one wanted to accuse them of being a foreign agent. [4]\n\nReuters reported, on the 19th from the SOHR, a set of three families (two unnamed) suggesting that at least 63 of the victims came from these alone (unless the 14 including 3 is the same, in error, as the one of 17).\n\nNeely, speaking to non-rebel locals, was given \"the names of families who had been killed,\" including (at least) \"members of the the Hamza family, the Khoulis and Ghalouls.\"[1] That's four families named.\n\nHoms Up-To-Date cited a fifth family - Deyab - as taking special hits. Among those first arrested (a number of men) were \"martyr Abdul Haseeb Deyab.” Some were released, but not apparently martyr Deyab. Then a Abu Mashhour Shehab Deyab's house hosted the burning of “some young men [who] were extrajudicially executed” in other houses and then burnt in his house. Then on the Al Deyab farmlands, \"they also executed the whole family and burnt their corpses.\" Numbers not specified. [4]\n\nHoms Up-To-Date also cited Al Mahbani family with \"farmlands right beside Al Deyab farmlands, where they killed more than 17 members.\" And finally, the Al Ghaloul family – mentioned to Neely - had their orchards raided, they say by the Shabiha-types, who “executed all the men, women, and children” they found from that family. [4]\n\nSeveral claims from both sides of the divide over blame jointly suggest some kind of grisly death in the orchards outside of town, where bodies were left to rot. Homs Up-To-Date related \"[A] Few of the young men were able to escape as they climbed on trees and hid in orchards. But the regime's Shabiha (thugs) caught them, executed them and tied them to trees.\" [4] James Miller at Enduring America, citing this report, made this unusual observation that manages to reject both competing versions and propose a third explanation, casting the sensationalism of the bodies-in-trees claim as evidence against itself:\n\nHowever, summary in-home executions are clearly evidenced, and there remains no evidence or claim of tanks and fighter jet attacks (both sides blame up-close slash-and-burn massacres). But there is supporting evidence for executed bodies in the orchards, if not necessarily strung up on trees. ITV's Bill Neely reported on meeting the local men:\n\nJames Miller passed on, from a discussion with Bill Neely of ITV, that \"the river divides the village, half of which the rebels control and the other half of which the military controls. The rebels use the orchards and nearby homes to attack the Intelligence Headquarters to the east.\" [4] [Wikimapia has an entry for \"الحصوية\" that highlights a broad area including a small patch of built-up streets like both video reports show. This must be the half the government can bring them to, the near (east) side and the north-center, anyway (see more detailed map below). And there's the much larger area of scattered homes set amongst orchards. The town part stops at the Orontes River, as shown on the inset map, with the green stretch residing mostly across it to the west and southwest.\n\nWikimapia and visual common sense indicate (as shown here) the military intel/academy/artillery base/army terrain area is to the west of town, not the east, nearer the orchard half the attacks were/would be launched from. Doucet had soldiers, corroborated by locals, who “said hundreds of men had entered the village from adjoining fields.” [7] To the south is more orchards and the bulk of Homs, to the west and north are city areas probably under government control. So the direction of entry is most likely from the northwest, where orchards soon yield to fields, and a bit off to places like Ar-Rastan, Al-Houla, Aqrab, Mazraaf, Halfaya, etc., where hundreds of rebels can gather and act at a time. They'd have to cross the highway and over or very near the \"army terrain\" to get into Haswiyeh's orchards. But otherwise it's small town, fields, and back-roads all the way from their closest known hotbed of Taldou, 20 km northwest.\n\nAs support for that, rebels said the killers came in the opposite way. The east end of town, closer to government-controlled Homs, has a factory of some sort with piles of perhaps clay-rich soil scraped-up nearby. This might well be the \"Al Boushi factory for ceramics\" cited by Homs Up-To-Date as the Shabiha killer congregation point. It's next to the mosque, and was recently built, appearing on satellite images as a construction site in 2011, and as complete in early 2012. The square tower went up early, over a pit some underground firing area, apparently. Both ITV and BBC teams were escorted in from the east, on a road right to a tower of this factory area. The grounds are also where Neely and his local witnesses walked and talked, the same tower visible.\n\nThe base from which the army escorted both journalist teams is at the other end of that road, in an unsure location. It was apparently at or near the massive sugar refinery. The proximity of that to the alleged massacre parking lot will not be lost on some, and that's likely why the activists said the killers came in that way.\n\nThe killing locations are of course a clue, and they tend to support the locals, not the activists. Doucet says in her BBC report \"most of the killings took place in houses down this hill,\" with a heavily tree-lined dirt road sloping down to a walled complex of large, red-roofed buildings. That would put the kill area on the west end of town, here on GM. [6], circled in red below-the northwest end of town. It would seem the rebels could have entered this nearest part of town with more scatted people/resistance, crossing where the river is at its narrowest, and a crossing (through a building?) lays nearby. They would most likely be on foot at this point, and dragging the bodies back would be a hassle.\n\nAs for the other version, these homes are clear across Haswiyeh from the possible ceramics factory. For the Army/Shabiha/Shi'ite/Hezbollah killers in the activist story, this would require a drive of at most 0.33 km from/past the sugar plant, parking the buses there at the east edge of town as reported, and then a walk of the same distance or more through town, when there is a perfectly drivable road all the way there.\n\nHow many of the killings and abductions were in the rebel-held orchards and homes across the way is unclear. Many lived there, with even less concentration and presumably less protection. Some people say some of them wound up tied to the trees they tried to hide in (see above).\n\nAs mentioned above, Bill Neely's ITV crew was shown a home where, it was said, a woman and her five young children (the oldest seven) were killed after refusing to let the rebels have the roof. They were burnt in a side-room the locals said, and that room had clearly been burned thoroughly, with a less-charred blanket where one of the bodies had been. In the outer room next to it, laundry hangs on a line, and an empty clothes basket lies in a puddle of blood on the linoleum floor, with a smear showing where the victim was the dragged away.\n\nIn that spot, however, a man - possibly a rebel fighter - was killed. Syrian private broadcaster Addounia TV showed the scene in a report of Jan. 17, before his body was removed. The nature of his injuries and cause of death are unclear (third image below). [10] They show the same charred room to the side ITV was shown.\n\nIt's not certain where the home Neely was shown is located, but most or all of his exterior shots seem to be on the east edge of town or in the open areas right next to it. BBC's Doucet took a foray much further in, due west to the top of the hill overlooking the bad place at the far end of town. Only by a safer roundabout route (northern, presumably) did soldiers get her up closer to where some victims, charred ones only, had still not been removed. She had just said that the soldiers said they had already removed the bodies - and this was the 18th, at least two days after the killings. [7] This, and the fact that bodies were left behind and not re-claimed by the hypothetical rebel killers (who usually do truck away and copiously video-record the victims they frequently \"find\"), are both interesting aspects of this case worth considering.\n\nThe buildings she shows seem to be in the compound in the north half of the red-circled area above. Exact buildings, perhaps, will be proposed. At right, a sample scene of victims she said seemed to have been killed while trying to flee. The fuel bottle was left behind. In total, she saw at least three scenes where bodies were or had been, which she described as within \"two family compounds.\" One body in the doorway and one a bit outside it were seen at one house, as shown in the inset image above. Another building was gutted by fire and had a few charred bodies inside. Another spot with no burning was \"a kitchen with long blood smears on the floor [which] suggested at least two bodies were dragged away.\" Poignantly, she wondered, \"had people been hiding in the cupboards?\" [7]\n\nA less verifiable rebel video, posted January 16, shows 18 seconds of the interior of a large home, charred and jumbled, with what seems to be two charred bodies. The cameraman is sobbing loudly as he films, suggesting it's his own home, or that we're to believe that. It was online and available to activists like the posters here, Sham Syrian News Network, on the 16th - after the massacres ended, perhaps before the fighting, and a day before news flashes were going out. [11]\n\nFrench foreign ministry spokesman Vincent Floreani said on Thursday, Jan. 17 that the killings at Al-Haswiyeh were “new proof of the savagery of President Bashar Al-Assad’s regime.” [12]\n\nSaudi Gazette reported \"A Homs-based activist who identified himself as Abu Bilal said, via the Internet, that the killings are “a stain on the world’s conscience.”\" [12]\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights urged the UN to send a fact-finding mission; As quoted by the AFP, Observatory member Rami Abdelrahman said “this needs to be investigated by the United Nations.” [13] The SOHR's Facebook page said \"We urge the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to send an international investigation team to Homs immediately, so as to investigate and fully document the massacre in order to bring all those responsible to justice.\" [14] This is unlikely to happen, in part for reasons the SOHR is familiar with. Asking for a similar investigation of killings in Ras Al-Ayn, they said \"we also bring to the UN's attention that they cannot refuse to send a mission by using the Syrian authorities refusal as an excuse, since the regime has no control whatsoever on that part of Syria.\" [15] That \"excuse\" would probably work in government-held Homs, and would likely be cited if any explicit refusal to investigate is ever issued.\n\nUNICEF issued a non-specific statement on the incident on January 20:",

            "text": "US President Barack Obama [Unlink] spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [Unlink] on Sunday evening, and stressed the need for an \"immediate and unconditional humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.\"\n\n\n\n\"Building on Secretary Kerry's efforts, the president made clear the strategic imperative of instituting an immediate, unconditional humanitarian ceasefire that ends hostilities now and leads to a permanent cessation of hostilities based on the November 2012 ceasefire agreement,\" the White House statement said.\n\n\n\n\"The president underscored the United States’ strong condemnation of Hamas [Unlink]’ rocket and tunnel attacks against Israel and reaffirmed Israel’s right to defend itself,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\n\"The president also reiterated the United States’ serious and growing concern about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives, as well as the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.\"\n\n\n\n\"The President stressed the US view that, ultimately, any lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict must ensure the disarmament of terrorist groups and the demilitarization of Gaza,\" it said.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, a draft of US Secretary of State John Kerry's ceasefire proposal that was shown to Israeli officials on Friday called for the opening of Gaza-Israel border crossings and ensuring \"the economic livelihood\" of Palestinians in the Strip, an Israeli newspaper reported .\n\n\n\nThe document, titled \"Framework for Humanitarian Ceasefire in Gaza,\" also said a lasting truce would make possible the \"transfer of funds to Gaza for the payment of salaries for public employees,\" Haaretz reported.\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, the proposed ceasefire would also \"address all security concerns.\"\n\n\n\nIsrael would not be allowed to continue its operation to destroy tunnels during the initial ceasefire, the draft reportedly stipulated.\n\n\n\nIt made no explicit mention of the demilitarization of Palestinian factions in Gaza.\n\n\n\nIsraeli officials were \"in shock\" upon reading the draft, saying it ignored Israel's security concerns.\n\n\n\n\"We succeeded in foiling that document and now we are discussing other options,\" Haaretz quoted officials as saying.\n\n\n\nAn associate of Kerry reportedly responded: \"There is no paper and no proposal. The draft was based on the Egyptian proposal that Israel wholeheartedly supported. So if they are opposed, they are opposed their own plan.\"\n\n\n\nIsrael voted down a ceasefire proposal Friday, instead agreeing to a 12-hour humanitarian truce starting Saturday at 8 a.m.\n\n\n\nOn July 15, Israel imposed a ceasefire agreed upon by Egypt and the US.\n\n\n\n\"We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarization of the (Gaza) Strip - from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels - through diplomatic means,\" he told reporters.\n\n\n\n\"But if Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet,\" Netanyahu added.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Palestinian factions including Hamas rejected the Egyptian initiative, for they were not consulted about it officially, when it was first suggested.\n\n\n\nIn response,Israel began its ground operation operation in Gaza two days later, and the death toll among Palestinians, mostly civilians, soared.\n\n\n\nHowever, Palestinian resistance factions have previously insisted they would only accept a cease-fire that included a lifting of Israel's eight-year blockade of the Gaza Strip, which prevents imports, exports and the movement of people, and has crippled the economy.\n\n\n\nIn related report, Political bureau chairman of Hamas Khaled Mashaal stressed that Hamas movement was ready to \"coexist with the Jews\" but would not tolerate \"occupiers.\"\n\n\n\n\"We are not fanatics, we are not fundamentalists. We are not actually fighting the Jews because they are Jews per se. We do not fight any other races. We fight the occupiers,\" he said during his his interview with US broadcaster PBS in the Qatari capital Doha.\n\n\n\n\"I'm ready to coexist with the Jews, with the Christians and the Arabs and non-Arabs,\" he said. \"However, I do not coexist with the occupiers.\"\n\n\n\nAsked by veteran interviewer Charlie Rose [Unlink] whether Palestinians could recognize the state of Israel as a Jewish state, Mashaal reiterated Hamas' position -- the group does not recognize Israel.\n\n\n\n\"When we have a Palestinian state then the Palestinian state will decide on its policies. You cannot actually ask me about the future. I answered you,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"But Palestinian people can have their say when they have their own state without occupation.\"\n\nA full version of the interview is to be broadcast late Monday.",

Israel has since “resumed some striking in Gaza” after Hamas’s apparent rejection of the terms was expressed in continued rocket fire following the 9 a.m. truce time. “If Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet,” said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to NBC News.\n\nThe weeks of violence stem from tensions surrounding the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June, followed by the revenge-killing of a Palestinian 16-year-old on July 2.\n\nThe botched cease-fire “followed a relatively quiet night, in which the Israeli military bombed 25 sites in Gaza, killing five people in the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, according to the Gaza Health Ministry; about 1,400 others have been wounded,” the New York Times reports. Overall, 185 Palestinians and no Israelis have been killed in the recent clashes.\n\n“Hamas has fired 47 rockets since we suspended our strikes in Gaza at 9 a.m. As a result, we have resumed our operation against Hamas,” said the IDF on Twitter. “Israel has right to defend itself,” said Secretary of State John Kerry from Vienna. “Hamas should not use civilians as shields.”\n\nAccording to the armed Hamas group the al-Qassam Brigades, the peace plan is “not worth the ink with which it was written,” it announced in a statement in Arabic. “Our battle with the enemy is continuing and will grow even more intense.”",

reconciliation deal by hazem balousha transkamal fayad july 03 2014 gaza city gaza strip — hamas remains committed to palestinian reconciliation contrary to reports suggesting the deal might fall apart because of israeli pressure in the wake of the kidnapping and murder of israeli and palestinian teenagers strong israeli opposition has largely rendered the palestinian unity government unable to bring about desired changes on the ground despite its receiving endorsements from the european union and the united states after the announcement of the government bringing an end to seven years of division between the west bank and gaza strip israel tried but failed to stymie international backing and recognition of it it has however succeeded in exploiting the kidnapping and killing of the three settlers to incite against palestinian president mahmoud abbas in light of recent crises gaza residents seem skeptical of the possibility that prime minister rami hamdallahs government will succeed in achieving true reconciliation and restore unity between the two territories prominent among the crises are the governments inability to pay the wages of former hamas government employees and the emergence of public disputes between the factions over the issue hamas official bassem naim expressed his displeasure over the unity governments handling of the salaries issue he thought the matter would be easily overcome but instead he believes its resolution was intentionally delayed out of fear of israeli pressure naim told almonitor israel was incapable of preventing reconciliation between palestinians in light of the clear european support afforded to the new government still president abbas seemed uninterested in moving forward with achieving unity for irrational reasons the palestinian government has blamed the nonpayment on international pressure threatening to impose financial sanctions on it if it paid the salaries of employees previously appointed by hamas naim rejected this contention stating we have met with many european diplomats who never raised this matter the issue is solely related to israeli pressure meanwhile following the abduction of the three hebron settlers israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu never missed an opportunity to attack the unity government blaming security tensions in the west bank and gaza on abbas alliance with hamas netanyahus arabiclanguage facebook page published a photograph showing an israeli civil defense member fighting a fire at a sderot factory after it was hit by a rocket launched from gaza the captioned reads since the formation of the fatahhamas alliance government 70 rockets and mortar rounds have been fired from the gaza strip on israel president abbas must end his alliance with the terrorist hamas organization the crisis between fatah and hamas escalated when mousa abu marzouk deputy chairman of hamas political bureau wrote on his facebook page i fear that hamas will be forced to backtrack for the sake of security and the safety of its people for gaza is living in limbo it is neither under the purview of the old government nor is it the responsibility of the national unity government a knowledgeable hamas source who talked to almonitor on the condition of anonymity said that hamas political bureau had recently met in the presence of the movements political and military leadership and decided to irrevocably move forward with the reconciliation according to the source the political bureau in all its components affirmed that the reconciliation option was a conscious and strategic one taken by hamas it will not be reversed irrespective of all the present crises with hamas exercising political and field pressure to make it a success halting the effort fulfills israels goal of sabotaging and ending the alliance the ongoing threats to launch a military attack on gaza and the incitement against hamas aims to push abu mazen abbas into forsaking hamas a scenario that we will tirelessly work to prevent abbas popularity has suffered in the west bank and gaza strip as a result of his statements on security cooperation following the kidnapping of the settlers while israeli accusations blaming hamas for the kidnapping have bolstered the movements popular standing many palestinians believe that israels aim — in its raids on west bank cities arrest campaigns and almost daily bombing of gaza — is to exploit the killings by convincing the palestinians that reconciliation between hamas and fatah will serve no good purpose the columnist alaa abu amer who resides in ramallah ruled out israels ability to thwart the palestinian reconciliation given the support afforded the new government by the united states as well as european and arab countries in a phone interview with almonitor he said in the end israel will be compelled to deal with the new government but the issue still requires a lot of coordinated effort between all parties with the fait accompli finally prevailing if fatah and hamas actually intend to make it succeed according to the hamas source movement members are angered by the palestinian authoritys pa silence on the israeli accusations leveled against it for the kidnappings and israels effort to spare the authority in its smear campaign israel no longer holds the pa responsible for the kidnappings instead concentrating its attacks on hamas israel appears to be trying to foil the implementation of the reconciliation agreement and render the palestinian unity government ineffectual by refusing to deal with or even recognize it and by preventing gaza and west bank ministers from traveling between the two territories after the discovery of the bodies of the settlers the israeli governments purpose became clearer in its targeting of hamas on the west bank and its threats to attack gaza without threatening the same against pa institutions the palestinian peoples ability to withstand the israeli onslaught might thwart tel avivs intentions hazem balousha is a palestinian journalist based in gaza city he has worked as a news producer for bbc world service contributed to deutsche welle and has written for the guardian alraya qatar and other publications he is the founder of the palestinian institute for communication and development picd on twitter ihazemi israel names hamas as being behind the killings – despite anomalies by stratfor via web arab news digest july 01 2014 hamas is responsible and hamas will pay israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu vowed on monday the 30th june upon the discovery of the bodies of the three teenagers kidnapped more than two weeks ago in the west bank a military escalation in the israelipalestinian theatre can therefore be expected as israel makes a retaliatory show of force using the crisis to keep hamas and fatah split between the two palestinian territories despite israels claims the highly unusual circumstances surrounding the kidnappings do not clearly point to hamas and the low likelihood that hamas wants to provoke a wider confrontation with israel combined with the constraints on the hamas rocket supply suggest that this latest flareup is less likely to widen into a sustained military confrontation a number of strange details surround the kidnapping and killing of the three israeli teenagers according to the official story three teenage male religious students were trying to hitchhike around 10 pm on the 12th june from the settlement block of gush etzion just outside of bethlehem to hebron in the west bank when they disappeared hitchhiking is not particularly uncommon in the area where buses are known to run infrequently but nonetheless this is a heavily patrolled area owing to the array of security threats which jewish settlers face in the west bank the three teenagers were shot and buried under stones in a field near the village of halhul just north of hebron only around 150 metres about 500 feet from a heavily guarded settlement compound now any arab militant group would find it extremely difficult to pull off such an operation in this area undetected had this been a hamas or hamasaffiliated operation we would expect the hostages to have been used as political capital for prisoner releases as we saw with the kidnapping of gilad shalit and although there is no direct evidence of this the killings could have been accidental given that they occurred at night in a highthreat environment if the killings were intentional then the operation at the very least appears to have been amateurish and the apparently hasty nature of the burials suggests an attempt to cover up the incident israel seems to be using the incident to further its political objective of undermining the hamasfatah political reconciliation by holding hamas responsible and thus raising the political cost to fatah of remaining aligned with the militant organisation in a national unity government why hamas would have carried out such an operation which it knew would lead to another conflagration in gaza and to renewed struggle with fatah when the hamas leadership has been trying to use a deal with fatah to normalise its political relations outside of gaza remains unclear hamas certainly does not appear to be getting much out of this operation in fact hamas distanced itself from the actual kidnapping because although it praised the act at the same time it denied having anything to do with it a collection of littleknown groups including dawlat alislam hezbollah battalions in palestine and battalions of the freeman of hebron all claimed the kidnapping although there has been little to corroborate any of the claims so far hamas is known to use front groups to give it cover for more controversial operations alternatively a hamas splinter faction could have carried out the attack to undermine the main groups dealings with fatah but that still does not explain how it was able to operate in such a heavily patrolled area of the west bank and much less why the operatives chose to kill and bury the hostages in any case israels unequivocal holding of hamas responsible for the act means retaliatory action on both sides can be expected in the coming days israel will be likely to rely on airstrikes raids and arrests against hamas while hamas and its militant affiliates will respond with rocket attacks there are probably limits however to how far this latest confrontation will go if our doubts regarding hamas involvement prove to be correct then hamas is probably unprepared for a major confrontation with israel the hamas rocket arsenal has been under strain since the 2012 pillar of defence campaign and egypts crackdown on the rafah border crossing but of critical interest to israel is the status of the supply of the longrange iranianmade fajr5 rockets in gaza after all the accumulation and launching of these rockets which could reach deep into israeli territory near jerusalem and tel aviv is what triggered israels intensive military campaign two years ago stratfor has seen indications since then that iran has continued its efforts to smuggle weapons through sudan and the sinai peninsula into gaza but it is safe to assume that it has become more difficult to ship arms along these supply lines in the past few years either way israel can be expected to seize the opportunity to deepen palestinian fissures while israeli emotions run high over the killings there is also always the possibility of militant actors and even militant sponsors such as iran exploiting the current tensions to escalate the conflict from what we can ascertain so far however a sustained military confrontation on par with the 2012 conflict seems unlikely result of airstrike in gaza israel mobilizing forces around gaza by jodi rudoren and isabel kershner ny times july 03 2014 jerusalem — the israeli military mobilized troops around the gaza strip on thursday after palestinian militants there fired some 30 rockets at southern israel over 24 hours three of which hit homes in the border town of sderot causing property damage but no injuries lt col peter lerner a military spokesman said that despite the mobilization israel was not interested in further escalating the violent exchanges with gaza that have been building for more than two weeks overnight 15 israeli airstrikes hit sites the military said were associated with hamas the islamic militant group that dominates gaza palestinian health officials said 10 people were wounded including a pregnant woman and a 65yearold man we are moving and we have moved forces to serve defensive activities and forward preparations colonel lerner told reporters on a conference call the main issue is how hamas is reading the situation he added we dont want to take it further but we will be prepared for the developments the deteriorating situation in the south comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in jerusalem where the burned body of a 16yearold palestinian muhammad hussein abu khdeir was found in a jerusalem forest on wednesday muhammad had been forced into a vehicle near his east jerusalem home about an hour before his body was discovered and the police are investigating whether he was killed in retaliation for the death of three israeli teenagers who were buried on tuesday after being kidnapped in the occupied west bank last month khaled meshal the political leader of hamas said in an interview from qatar published wednesday that the organization was also not interested in an escalation but a gazabased hamas leader said on thursday that the group was having trouble convincing other militants to hold their fire in general there was an agreement to calm the situation said the official speaking on the condition of anonymity because of internal politics we are communicating with the factions to stop them from firing rockets but the justification is always look at what the israelis are doing in the west bank and east jerusalem the authorities were also scrambling to investigate a possible third kidnapping thursday afternoon after a girl called a police hotline from near maalot a city in northern israel a police spokesman said she said that she was abducted and then the line went dead micky rosenfeld the spokesman said were searching the area helicopters are trying to track well see whats going on there muhammads abduction and killing set off violent protests in parts of east jerusalem that stretched into wednesday night and there were fears that his funeral could stir broader unrest saeb erekat the chief palestinian negotiator said president mahmoud abbas of the palestinian authority had been making extensive international contacts since muhammads death and would convene a meeting of the palestinian leadership on thursday to consider among other things joining more united nations institutions including the international criminal court violence will only lead to more violence in the region it has killed all chances for peace mr erekat a member of the palestine liberation organizations executive committee said on voice of palestine radio the entire world has condemned the killing of abu khdeir but the world should also follow up why was muhammad kidnapped killed why are the settlers allowed to run wild in jerusalem why can they take the law in their own hands there is only one answer because of the continuing israeli occupation in shuafat the relatively welltodo neighborhood where muhammad lived palestinians from across jerusalem huddled thursday on plastic chairs under a canopy outside his home waiting for the israeli authorities to release his body after an autopsy as the crowd of mourners swelled into the hundreds members of the victims family announced they would not accept the body until it had received a clear declaration that the killing was an act of revenge by jews and not the result of a family dispute later though they related and said the funeral would likely be friday afternoon we want a written paper from the israeli government saying the crime was committed on a national background muhammads unclear ishak abu khdeir told reporters israeli officials have said they are considering all possible motives for the attack we are in a state of waiting and expectation said muhammads cousin said abu khdeir 45 who owns a restaurant in the neighborhood it will not be a normal funeral it will be a wedding for a martyr he added another relative muhammad abu khdeir a 46yearold english teacher said the hatred has increased instantly ive never seen such racism even in the first and second intifada he added we are entering a very dark time after a quiet day clashes began again around 5 pm with some 300 palestinians some masked hurling

midnight according to the israeli military two were intercepted by israels iron dome missile defense system 16 reached israeli territory and three fell short and apparently landed in gaza tensions along the israelgaza border have been simmering since the kidnapping of the three israeli teenagers on june 12 israel has blamed hamas for their abduction and murder conducting a campaign against the groups infrastructure in the west bank that has included raids on scores of institutions and the arrest of more than 400 palestinians the growing intensity of the clashes in the south and the erosion of an egyptianbrokered ceasefire which ended eight days of fierce fighting across the israelgaza border in november 2012 have raised the prospect of another fullblown confrontation there colonel lerner the military spokesman said repeatedly during the conference call with reporters that we have no interest in escalation he said the mobilization thursday included a limited callup of tens of reserve officers who would be assigned to headquarters not to posts in the field he added that other troops — he would not even hint how many — are taking up positions in the surrounding communities of gaza we have no interest in deepening the conflict with gaza — the absolute opposite is our interest colonel lerner said we do need to have the forces that give the substantial preparation in case hamas decides to continue and escalate it our activities on the ground are in direct relation to what hamas has been dealing out said ghazali contributed reporting from jerusalem and fares akram from

Air raid sirens sounded in communities across the south of Israel and a soldier was reported to have been slightly injured by a rocket strike in Eshkol.\n\nThe teenager was seen being forced into a car in Shufat, East Jerusalem, early on Wednesday and his body was later found in West Jerusalem.\n\nIt comes after the bodies of the three Israeli seminary students were found near the city of Hebron on Monday, two-and-a-half weeks after they were abducted. Their funerals took place on Tuesday.\n\nMr Netanyahu blamed their deaths on Hamas and called on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to abandon a partnership his Fatah movement had struck with the group. Hamas has denied any involvement in the murders.\n\n\n\n Hamas committed to unity deal despite Israeli pressure\n\n \n\n Hamas believes Israel is trying to exploit the murders of three settlers in the West Bank to destroy the Palestinian reconciliation deal.\n\n\n\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — Hamas remains committed to Palestinian reconciliation, contrary to reports suggesting the deal might fall apart because of Israeli pressure in the wake of the kidnapping and murder of Israeli and Palestinian teenagers. Strong Israeli opposition has largely rendered the Palestinian unity government unable to bring about desired changes on the ground, despite its receiving endorsements from the European Union and the United States.\n\nAfter the announcement of the government, bringing an end to seven years of division between the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israel tried but failed to stymie international backing and recognition of it. It has, however, succeeded in exploiting the kidnapping and killing of the three settlers to incite against Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nIn light of recent crises, Gaza residents seem skeptical of the possibility that Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah’s government will succeed in achieving true reconciliation and restore unity between the two territories. Prominent among the crises are the government’s inability to pay the wages of former Hamas government employees and the emergence of public disputes between the factions over the issue.\n\nHamas official Bassem Naim expressed his displeasure over the unity government’s handling of the salaries issue. He thought the matter would be easily overcome, but instead, he believes, its resolution was intentionally delayed out of fear of Israeli pressure. Naim told Al-Monitor, “Israel was incapable of preventing reconciliation between Palestinians, in light of the clear European support afforded to the new government. Still, President Abbas seemed uninterested in moving forward with achieving unity for irrational reasons.”\n\nThe Palestinian government has blamed the nonpayment on international pressure threatening to impose financial sanctions on it if it paid the salaries of employees previously appointed by Hamas. Naim rejected this contention, stating, “We have met with many European diplomats who never raised this matter. The issue is solely related to Israeli pressure.”\n\nMeanwhile, following the abduction of the three Hebron settlers, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu never missed an opportunity to attack the unity government, blaming security tensions in the West Bank and Gaza on Abbas’ alliance with Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu’s Arabic-language Facebook page published a photograph showing an Israeli Civil Defense member fighting a fire at a Sderot factory after it was hit by a rocket launched from Gaza. The captioned reads, “Since the formation of the Fatah-Hamas alliance government, 70 rockets and mortar rounds have been fired from the Gaza Strip on Israel. President Abbas must end his alliance with the terrorist Hamas organization.”\n\nThe crisis between Fatah and Hamas escalated when Mousa Abu Marzouk, deputy chairman of Hamas’ political bureau, wrote on his Facebook page, “I fear that Hamas will be forced to backtrack for the sake of security and the safety of its people. For Gaza is living in limbo, it is neither under the purview of the old government, nor is it the responsibility of the national unity government.”\n\nA knowledgeable Hamas source who talked to Al-Monitor on the condition of anonymity said that Hamas’ political bureau had recently met in the presence of the movement’s political and military leadership and decided to irrevocably move forward with the reconciliation. According to the source, “The political bureau, in all its components, affirmed that the reconciliation option was a conscious and strategic one taken by Hamas. It will not be reversed irrespective of all the present crises, with Hamas exercising political and field pressure to make it a success. Halting the effort fulfills Israel’s goal of sabotaging and ending the alliance. The ongoing threats to launch a military attack on Gaza and the incitement against Hamas aims to push Abu Mazen [Abbas] into forsaking Hamas, a scenario that we will tirelessly work to prevent.”\n\nAbbas’ popularity has suffered in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a result of his statements on security cooperation following the kidnapping of the settlers, while Israeli accusations blaming Hamas for the kidnapping have bolstered the movement’s popular standing. Many Palestinians believe that Israel’s aim — in its raids on West Bank cities, arrest campaigns and almost daily bombing of Gaza — is to exploit the killings by convincing the Palestinians that reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah will serve no good purpose.\n\nThe columnist Alaa Abu Amer, who resides in Ramallah, ruled out Israel’s ability to thwart the Palestinian reconciliation, given the support afforded the new government by the United States as well as European and Arab countries. In a phone interview with Al-Monitor, he said, “In the end, Israel will be compelled to deal with the new government. But the issue still requires a lot of coordinated effort between all parties, with the fait accompli finally prevailing, if Fatah and Hamas actually intend to make it succeed.”\n\nAccording to the Hamas source, movement members are angered by the Palestinian Authority’s (PA) silence on the Israeli accusations leveled against it for the kidnappings and Israel’s effort to spare the authority in its smear campaign. Israel no longer holds the PA responsible for the kidnappings, instead concentrating its attacks on Hamas.\n\nIsrael appears to be trying to foil the implementation of the reconciliation agreement and render the Palestinian unity government ineffectual by refusing to deal with or even recognize it, and by preventing Gaza and West Bank ministers from traveling between the two territories. After the discovery of the bodies of the settlers, the Israeli government’s purpose became clearer in its targeting of Hamas on the West Bank and its threats to attack Gaza without threatening the same against PA institutions. The Palestinian people’s ability to withstand the Israeli onslaught might thwart Tel Aviv’s intentions.\n\nHazem Balousha is a Palestinian journalist based in Gaza City. He has worked as a news producer for BBC World Service, contributed to Deutsche Welle and has written for The Guardian, Al-Raya (Qatar) and other publications. He is the founder of the Palestinian Institute for Communication and Development (PICD). On Twitter: @iHaZeMi\n\n“Hamas is responsible, and Hamas will pay,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Monday the 30th June upon the discovery of the bodies of the three teenagers kidnapped more than two weeks ago in the West Bank. A military escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian theatre can therefore be expected as Israel makes a retaliatory show of force, using the crisis to keep Hamas and Fatah split between the two Palestinian territories.\n\nDespite Israel’s claims, the highly unusual circumstances surrounding the kidnappings do not clearly point to Hamas, and the low likelihood that Hamas wants to provoke a wider confrontation with Israel, combined with the constraints on the Hamas rocket supply, suggest that this latest flare-up is less likely to widen into a sustained military confrontation.\n\nA number of strange details surround the kidnapping and killing of the three Israeli teenagers. According to the official story, three teenage male religious students were trying to hitchhike around 10 p.m. on the 12th June from the settlement block of Gush Etzion, just outside of Bethlehem, to Hebron in the West Bank when they disappeared. Hitchhiking is not particularly uncommon in the area, where buses are known to run infrequently, but nonetheless, this is a heavily patrolled area owing to the array of security threats which Jewish settlers face in the West Bank. The three teenagers were shot and buried under stones in a field near the village of Halhul, just north of Hebron, only around 150 metres (about 500 feet) from a heavily guarded settlement compound.\n\nNow any Arab militant group would find it extremely difficult to pull off such an operation in this area undetected. Had this been a Hamas or Hamas-affiliated operation, we would expect the hostages to have been used as political capital for prisoner releases, as we saw with the kidnapping of Gilad Shalit, and although there is no direct evidence of this, the killings could have been accidental given that they occurred at night in a high-threat environment. If the killings were intentional, then the operation at the very least appears to have been amateurish and the apparently hasty nature of the burials suggests an attempt to cover up the incident.\n\nIsrael seems to be using the incident to further its political objective of undermining the Hamas-Fatah political reconciliation by holding Hamas responsible, and thus raising the political cost to Fatah of remaining aligned with the militant organisation in a national unity government. Why Hamas would have carried out such an operation, which it knew would lead to another conflagration in Gaza, and to renewed struggle with Fatah, when the Hamas leadership has been trying to use a deal with Fatah to normalise its political relations outside of Gaza remains unclear. Hamas certainly does not appear to be getting much out of this operation.\n\nIn fact, Hamas distanced itself from the actual kidnapping; because although it praised the act at the same time, it denied having anything to do with it. A collection of little-known groups, including Dawlat al-Islam, Hezbollah Battalions in Palestine, and Battalions of the Freeman of Hebron, all claimed the kidnapping, although there has been little to corroborate any of the claims so far. Hamas is known to use front groups to give it cover for more controversial operations. Alternatively, a Hamas splinter faction could have carried out the attack to undermine the main group’s dealings with Fatah, but that still does not explain how it was able to operate in such a heavily patrolled area of the West Bank, and much less why the operatives chose to kill and bury the hostages.\n\nIn any case, Israel’s unequivocal holding of Hamas responsible for the act means retaliatory action on both sides can be expected in the coming days. Israel will be likely to rely on airstrikes, raids and arrests against Hamas, while Hamas and its militant affiliates will respond with rocket attacks. There are probably limits, however, to how far this latest confrontation will go.\n\nIf our doubts regarding Hamas’ involvement prove to be correct, then Hamas is probably unprepared for a major confrontation with Israel. The Hamas rocket arsenal has been under strain since the 2012 Pillar of Defence Campaign, and Egypt’s crackdown on the Rafah border crossing, but of critical interest to Israel is the status of the supply of the long-range, Iranian-made Fajr-5 rockets in Gaza. After all, the accumulation and launching of these rockets, which could reach deep into Israeli territory near Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, is what triggered Israel’s intensive military campaign two years ago. STRATFOR has seen indications since then that Iran has continued its efforts to smuggle weapons through Sudan and the Sinai Peninsula into Gaza, but it is safe to assume that it has become more difficult to ship arms along these supply lines in the past few years.\n\nEither way, Israel can be expected to seize the opportunity to deepen Palestinian fissures while Israeli emotions run high over the killings. There is also always the possibility of militant actors, and even militant sponsors such as Iran exploiting the current tensions to escalate the conflict. From what we can ascertain so far, however, a sustained military confrontation on par with the 2012 conflict seems unlikely.\n\n\n\n Result of airstrike in Gaza.\n\n \n\n \n\n Israel Mobilizing Forces Around Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM — The Israeli military mobilized troops around the Gaza Strip on Thursday after Palestinian militants there fired some 30 rockets at southern Israel over 24 hours, three of which hit homes in the border town of Sderot, causing property damage but no injuries.\n\nLt. Col. Peter Lerner, a military spokesman, said that despite the mobilization, Israel was not interested in further escalating the violent exchanges with Gaza that have been building for more than two weeks. Overnight, 15 Israeli airstrikes hit sites the military said were associated with Hamas, the Islamic militant group that dominates Gaza; Palestinian health officials said 10 people were wounded, including a pregnant woman and a 65-year-old man.\n\n“We are moving, and we have moved, forces to serve defensive activities and forward preparations,” Colonel Lerner told reporters on a conference call.\n\n“The main issue is how Hamas is reading the situation,” he added. “We don’t want to take it further, but we will be prepared for the developments.”\n\nThe deteriorating situation in the south comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in Jerusalem, where the burned body of a 16-year-old Palestinian, Muhammad Hussein Abu Khdeir, was found in a Jerusalem forest on Wednesday. Muhammad had been forced into a vehicle near his East Jerusalem home about an hour before his body was discovered, and the police are investigating whether he was killed in retaliation for the death of three Israeli teenagers who were buried on Tuesday after being kidnapped in the occupied West Bank last month.\n\nKhaled Meshal, the political leader of Hamas, said in an interview from Qatar, published Wednesday, that the organization was also not interested in an escalation. But a Gaza-based Hamas leader said on Thursday that the group was having trouble convincing other militants to hold their fire.\n\n“In general, there was an agreement to calm the situation,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of internal politics. “We are communicating with the factions to stop them from firing rockets, but the justification is always, ‘Look at what the Israelis are doing in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.’”\n\nThe authorities were also scrambling to investigate a possible third kidnapping Thursday afternoon, after a girl called a police hotline from near Maalot, a city in northern Israel, a police spokesman said. “She said that she was abducted and then the line went dead,” Micky Rosenfeld, the spokesman, said. “We’re searching the area. Helicopters are trying to track. We’ll see what’s going on there.”\n\nMuhammad’s abduction and killing set off violent protests in parts of East Jerusalem that stretched into Wednesday night, and there were fears that his funeral could stir broader unrest.\n\nSaeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority had “been making extensive international contacts” since Muhammad’s death and would convene a meeting of the Palestinian leadership on Thursday to consider, among other things, joining more United Nations institutions, including the International Criminal Court.\n\n“Violence will only lead to more violence in the region; it has killed all chances for peace,” Mr. Erekat, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s executive committee, said on Voice of Palestine radio. “The entire world has condemned the killing of Abu Khdeir, but the world should also follow up. Why was Muhammad kidnapped, killed? Why are the settlers allowed to run wild in Jerusalem? Why can they take the law in their own hands? There is only one answer: because of the continuing Israeli occupation.”\n\nIn Shuafat, the relatively well-to-do neighborhood where Muhammad lived, Palestinians from across Jerusalem huddled Thursday on plastic chairs under a canopy outside his home, waiting for the Israeli authorities to release his body after an autopsy. As the crowd of mourners swelled into the hundreds, members of the victim’s family announced they would not accept the body until it had received a clear declaration that the killing was an act of revenge by Jews and not the result of a family dispute. Later, though, they related and said the funeral would likely be Friday afternoon.\n\n“We want a written paper from the Israeli government saying the crime was committed on a national background,” Muhammad’s unclear, Ishak Abu Khdeir, told reporters.\n\nIsraeli officials have said they are considering all possible motives for the attack.\n\n“We are in a state of waiting and expectation,” said Muhammad’s cousin, Said Abu Khdeir, 45, who owns a restaurant in the neighborhood. “It will not be a normal funeral. It will be a wedding for a martyr,” he added. Another relative, Muhammad Abu Khdeir, a 46-year-old English teacher, said, “the hatred has increased” instantly. “I’ve never seen such racism, even in the first and second intifada,” he added. “We are entering a very dark time.”\n\nAfter a quiet day, clashes began again around 5 p.m., with some 300 Palestinians, some masked, hurling stones at Israeli soldiers, who used stun grenades to contain the crowd.\n\nThe streets were already littered with remnants of the previous day’s confrontations.\n\nTraffic lights were smashed and large metal trash containers overturned. Stones were still strewn across the asphalt. The first floor of an unfinished building where soldiers had huddled was blackened from Molotov cocktails.\n\nThe shops — Joulani Furniture, Abu Irmeileh Pharmacy, a local post office and a place to get aluminium window frames — were all shuttered.\n\nThere was fresh graffiti: “Resistance lives on,” read one splash of red paint, in Arabic. “The martyr of the predawn,” read another. On one of several smashed shelters for the light-rail line that normally runs along the main road, the words “Death to Jews” were written in Hebrew, near Muhammad’s name and “Palestine is free and Arab,” in Arabic.\n\nIn Sderot, the Israeli town about a mile from Gaza’s edge, one rocket penetrated the wall of a house that soon will house a small summer camp for babies. The rocket landed on the upper floor of the house but failed to explode; two mothers and their children had taken shelter in a fortified safe room and escaped injury.\n\nTami Jorno, who plans to open the camp, said she heard the crash of a rocket.\n\n“I went out to look in the garden,” she told Ynet, a Hebrew news site. “I didn’t imagine it would be in the bedroom.”\n\nA total of 21 rockets were launched from Gaza after midnight, according to the Israeli military. Two were intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, 16 reached Israeli territory and three fell short and apparently landed in Gaza.\n\nTensions along the Israel-Gaza border have been simmering since the kidnapping of the three Israeli teenagers on June 12. Israel has blamed Hamas for their abduction and murder, conducting a campaign against the group’s infrastructure in the West Bank that has included raids on scores of institutions and the arrest of more than 400 Palestinians.\n\nThe growing intensity of the clashes in the south and the erosion of an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire, which ended eight days of fierce fighting across the Israel-Gaza border in November 2012, have raised the prospect of another full-blown confrontation there.\n\nColonel Lerner, the military spokesman, said repeatedly during the conference call with reporters that, “We have no interest in escalation.” He said the mobilization Thursday included a limited call-up of “tens of reserve officers” who would be assigned to headquarters, not to posts in the field.\n\nHe added that other troops — he would not even hint how many — “are taking up positions in the surrounding communities of Gaza.”\n\n“We have no interest in deepening the conflict with Gaza — the absolute opposite is our interest,” Colonel Lerner said. “We do need to have the forces that give the substantial preparation in case Hamas decides to continue and escalate it. Our activities on the ground are in direct relation to what Hamas has been dealing out.”\n\nSaid Ghazali contributed reporting from Jerusalem, and Fares Akram from Gaza.\n\n\n\n Palestinians stand next to a crater which police said was caused by an Israeli air strike in Gaza City July 3, 2014. Reuters\n\n \n\n 11 injured in multiple Israeli airstrikes on Gaza\n\nGAZA CITY — Eleven Palestinians were injured overnight Wednesday as Israel attacked 15 targets in the Gaza Strip, medics said.\n\nGaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said 11 Palestinians were hospitalized following multiple airstrikes, including a 17-year-old boy who sustained shrapnel wounds near Gaza City.\n\nAnother airstrike targeted a Hamas training base west of Gaza City, with an elderly woman and teenage girl sustaining injuries in the northern Gaza Strip.\n\nThree airstrikes targeted Hamas training bases in the al-Shujaiyya neighborhood of Gaza City and the city of Beit Hanoun, while a further three airstrikes targeted an area near the former PA intelligence headquarters in northern Gaza.\n\nIn southern Gaza, an airstrike targeted a military base belonging to Hamas near Rafah.\n\nIsrael’s army said it carried out strikes against 15 Hamas targets in Gaza “including concealed rocket launchers, weapon storage facilities and terror activity sites.”\n\nTwenty rockets were fired at Israel since Wednesday, Israel’s army said, with one hitting a home in the city of Sderot, with no injuries reported.",

            "text": "UPDATE: An Israeli civilian was killed on Tuesday in a rocket attack on the Erez border crossing with Gaza, the IDF said. The unnamed victim is the first Israeli casualty since the beginning of the military operation against Hamas launched last week.\n\nHopes for a break from the strikes that killed at least 184 Palestinians in Gaza over the last eight days were quickly crushed on Tuesday when a ceasefire brokered by Egypt collapsed in a matter of hours.\n\nThe IDF announced it had resumed strikes on Gaza, saying that since 9am on Tuesday, when the ceasefire started, Hamas had fired 76 rockets into Israel — with the Iron Dome intercepting nine of them. The civilian struck by a rocket on Tuesday was the first Israeli casualty since Israel launched Operation Protective Edge in response to the abduction and murder of three teenage settlers near Hebron, in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThousands of Palestinians flee northern Gaza ahead of intensified Israeli strikes. Read more here.\n\nThe Egyptian government had announced a mutual \"de-escalation\" of the conflict, which was supposed to lead to an end to the fighting within 12 hours. But the truce never got that far.\n\nIsraeli officials voted to accept the truce on Tuesday, but warned that they would respond strongly if rockets continued to come from the Gaza strip.\n\nIn a press conference following the announcement of the truce, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would “have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet” if Hamas continued launching rockets at Israel.\n\nA spokesman for Hamas said the group never agreed to the Egyptian deal — which he called “worthless” — and claimed that it was never asked about it in the first place. He said that the group found out details about the deal “from the media.”\n\n\"We in Hamas haven't heard about the Egyptian suggestions except on media outlets,” Sami Abu Zuhri said. “Nobody has consulted us about this initiative, and so it is natural that the initiative isn't binding to us.\"\n\nHamas has said before that any ceasefire proposal must require an end to the Israeli blockage of Gaza and the release of hundreds of Palestinians arrested in the West Bank during the search for the missing teens. Neither point was included in the Egyptian deal, which also failed to address Hamas's request that Egypt ease restrictions for Palestinians crossing the Gaza-Egypt border at Rafah.\n\nIt is not the first time Egypt attempts to mediate in the neighboring conflict, but this is the first attempted deal by the newly elected government of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, which has accused Hamas of supporting Islamist militants in Egypt. Hamas denies the claim.\n\nOther Palestinian groups including Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine also said they had not agreed to the Egyptian proposal, Reuters reported.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas encouraged the ceasefire, as did US Secretary of State John Kerry. \"I cannot condemn strongly enough the actions of Hamas in so brazenly firing rockets, in multiple numbers, in the face of a goodwill effort (to secure) a ceasefire,\" Kerry said from Vienna.\n\nMore than 4,000 Palestinians have already fled the northern part of Gaza following the Israeli offensive despite Hamas's insistence that people \"stay in their houses.\"",

            "text": "TEL AVIV - Israel resumed military action against Hamas Tuesday, giving up on an Egypt-brokered truce after Palestinian militants refused to join the deal and continued to fire rockets over the border.\n\nIsrael’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered airstrikes to resume after Hamas gave no indication it would accept the cease-fire.\n\nEarlier, Israel's security Cabinet had voted to approve the truce starting 9 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET) after a meeting in Tel Aviv. However, air raids sirens sounded across southern Israel more than two hours after the truce came into effect as dozens of rockets were fired from Gaza.\n\nquot;If Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet,quot; Netanyahu told reporters.\n\nAt least seven Israeli airstrikes were later heard in the Gaza Strip.\n\nHamas’ armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, earlier said it had not been approached about any deal and that the terms, as reported in the media, amounted to a capitulation. The deal is “not worth the ink with which it was written,” it said in a statement posted on its website [link in Arabic].\n\nquot;Our battle with the enemy is continuing and will grow even more intense,quot; the statement added.\n\nMoussa Abu Marzouk, a top Hamas official who was in Cairo, said the movement had made no final decision. “We are still in consultation and there has been no official position made by the (Hamas) movement regarding the Egyptian proposal,'' he said, according to Reuters.\n\nHowever, Israel indicated that it would not wait any longer for Hamas to join the cease-fire. It said at least 50 rockets were fired from Gaza in the hours after the truce began.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry said he “cannot condemn strongly enough” the firing of rockets into Israel in the face of a crease-fire deal that had been agreed in “good faith.”\n\n“Israel has right to defend itself,” he told reporters in Vienna where he was attending nuclear talks with Iran. “Hamas should not use civilians as shields.”\n\nHe said he was prepared to fly to the region “if needed” but said Egypt “deserves time and space to make this work,” adding: “We urge all parties to support this ceasefire.”\n\nIsraeli television showed the Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepting several rockets over the port city of Ashdod. Israel’s military said three rockets landed in an open area near Ashkelon, causing no casualties. There was no immediate word of damage from the other rockets.\n\nIn the overnight hours prior to the truce, Israel bombed 25 sites in Gaza overnight. Palestinian medical officials said two people were killed — bringing the enclave's death toll to more than 182 in the recent action.\n\nRanna Khalil and Paul Goldman of NBC News and Reuters contributed to this report.

            "text": "News desk :Israel resumed air strikes in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, six hours after agreeing to an Egyptian-proposed truce.Israel had earlier accepted an Egyptian truce proposal for the conflict and stopped operations on Tuesday morning. However, the armed wing of Hamas, which controls Gaza, rejected the initiative as a \"surrender\".Under the ceasefire proposal announced by Egypt's Foreign Ministry, high-level delegations from Israel and the Palestinian factions would hold separate talks in Cairo within 48 hours to consolidate the ceasefire with \"confidence-building measures\".Hamas leaders have said a ceasefire must include an end to Israel's blockade of Gaza and a recommitment to a truce reached in an eight-day war there in 2012. Hamas also wants Egypt to ease restrictions at its Rafah crossing with Gaza imposed after the military toppled Islamist president Mohamed Mursi last July. The Egyptian proposal made no mention of Rafah or when restrictions might be eased.   Hamas has faced a cash crisis and Gaza's economic hardship has deepened as a result of Egypt's destruction of cross-border smuggling tunnels. Cairo accuses Hamas of aiding anti-government Islamist militants in Egypt's Sinai peninsula, an allegation the Palestinian group denies.Hamas has said it also wants the release of hundreds of its activists arrested in the West Bank while Israel searched for the three missing teens.The proposed truce also made no mention of the detainees.Egypt won't give up on its diplomatic efforts after a single setback but the resumption of hostilities means the question of whether Israel will eventually order ground operations is back on the agenda.Under the terms of the Egyptian initiative, the ceasefire should have been followed by a series of meetings in Cairo with high-level delegations from the two sides.There has been no definitive response to the initiative from Hamas. Senior Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan told the BBC it had only heard about the truce initiative through the media and that a ceasefire could not be put in place without the details of any agreement being known.The armed wing of Hamas, the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades, dismissed the initiative, saying its battle with Israel would \"increase in ferocity and intensity\".US Secretary of State John Kerry said he could not \"condemn strongly enough\" Hamas' actions in continuing to fire rockets.Meanwhile, according to the United Nations Israeli attacks have killed some militants, around 70% of the fatalities were civilians and more than 30 are children.An Israeli official, speaking as the Israeli strikes resumed, said: \"The prime minister and the defense minister have ordered the Israeli armed forces to take powerful action against terrorist targets in Gaza.\"Earlier, Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, said that demands the movement has made must be met before it lays down its weapons.Other Palestinian militant groups - Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine - also said they had not yet agreed to the Egyptian offer.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who reached an agreement with Hamas in April that led to the formation of a unity government last month, urged acceptance of the proposal, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA said.Amos Gilad, a senior Israeli defence official and envoy to Cairo, told Israel's Army Radio that Hamas had been weakened by the air and sea bombardment of Gaza, having tried \"every possible means of striking at Israel.\"Hundreds of rockets fired at Israel have caused no fatalities, largely due to Iron Dome. But the strikes are a threat that send people rushing into shelters.Israel had mobilised tens of thousands of troops for a threatened Gaza invasion if the rocket salvoes persisted.\"We still have the possibility of going in, under cabinet authority, and putting an end to (the rockets),\" Gilad said.In overnight attacks before the brief ceasefire, Israel said it had bombed 25 sites in Gaza. Palestinian medical officials said a 63-year-old man and a 52-year-old woman were killed.Palestinian officials say at least 192 people have been killed by Israeli air strikes launched eight days ago.At least four Israelis have been seriously injured since the violence flared, but none have been killed.",

yesterday egypt announced a proposal for a ceasefire both sides would stop firing and then in 48 hours parties would convene in cairo and via an intermediary discuss terms for a more permanent truce kerry was said to be coming to cairo to participate this really did not have a good feel to it and there was anxiety in several quarters here regarding what appeared to be pending capitulation by our prime minister for word had come out that he was favoring acceptance of this proposal was he going to say that we had done enough and that it was now time for quiet for quiet for the bottom line is that we have not done enough i dont care what defense minister yaalon says yes there are ways in which hamas has taken a real beating but im picking up on reports that indicate that the key leaders sitting in their underground tunnels are alive and well and would be ready to pick up the fight again in no time similarly because of the tunnels and the use of human shields a large portion of the rockets remains intact and ready for future use one source said weve destroyed onethird of their rockets yaakov amidror who is a straight talker says they have retained 90 of their high quality rockets no it hardly time seemed like time to call it quits if there is serious intent to make sure that hamas does not come back at us again in two years or three or four or five of course there was always the question of what netanyahu would demand at those truce negotiations but yetbut yet this morning the prime minister called a 700 am meeting of the eightperson security cabinet to discuss the egyptian proposal word came out that they had decided to accept the proposal only naftali bennett and avigdor lieberman were opposed and they were both furious hearts dropped stomachs tightened all over israel this looked like caving a disastrous show of weakness my own depression and yes i know what depression is was heavy at 900 am we stopped all attacks on gaza but hamas adamantly and defiantly refusing the egyptian proposal kept right on firing rockets at us at least 50 in the next six hours hamas would have had trouble accepting the ceasefire because they had not achieved any significant victories with their honorshame mentalset it would have been near impossible to do especially as they did not anticipate any major victory in the negotiations no gaza blockade lifted no hamas prisoners released their leaders actually complained about this how can we stop when there is nothing indicated about what terms would be all that was discussed was a readiness by israel to open crossings to let additional supplies in it took six hours at 300 pm netanyahu said thats it he ordered attacks on gaza to begin again and about half an hour later they started well nowwe were suddenly seeing something different and perhaps quite brilliant netanyahu had been seeing the growing criticism of israel around the world the scum in hamas by encouraging human shields had upped the casualties and secured multiple pr opportunities for talking about how israel hits innocent children see more about this below in multiple quarters there were antiisrael voices being raised forgotten is the fact that hamas started firing those rockets first or that we abort sorties to save children our prime minister and the cabinet likely saw that carrying through a major operation would have been increasingly problematic because of large scale international criticism the dynamic needed to be changed and this undoubtedly changed it the situation was structured so that netanyahu became a seeker of peace the person willing to stop shooting and hamas was the party that sought violence even in the face of quiet this is what netanyahu said at a press conference earlier today with the german foreign minister emphasis added the refusal of hamas to honor the ceasefire gives israel full legitimacy to expand the operation to protect our people we agreed to the egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarization of the strip from missiles from rockets and from tunnels through diplomatic means but if hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal as would now seem to be the case israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet httpwwwynetnewscomarticles07340l454368500html john kerry had cancelled his trip to cairo because there were not going to be any ceasefire negotiations after all from vienna he said emphasis added i can not condemn strongly enough the actions of hamas in so brazenly firing rockets in multiple numbers in the face of a goodwill effort to offer a ceasefire in which egypt and israel worked together that the international community strongly supports hamas is purposely playing politics by continuing the rocket fire using innocents as human shields against the laws of war and that is why they are a terrorist organization httpwwwjpostcomoperationprotectiveedgekerrycancelstriptocairorelyingonegyptianbrokeredceasefireinstead362853 how about that he can not tell us to use restraint now can he im going to stick my neck out here with pure speculation colored by a bit of intuition no one has let me in on any secrets i think it possible that egypt was complicit in setting up a situation that cornered hamas i think this did not just happen ive provided evidence in recent days of an egyptian desire to have israel take out hamas their role in the current scenario has helped to make it more possible how far will israel now go towards taking hamas out this remains to be seen still tonight i hold my breath as i wait to see what unfolds the nation is so weary of this and so eager to be done with hamas we are being told there is a long operation likely ahead of us and that what must be done will be done but this tells us nothing the prime minister says the war will intensify lieberman is pushing for us to take over gaza ynet quotes an unnamed senior military official who said a ground offensive could help combat the many tunnels in the strip where the air force is not effective our recommendations to the political leadership were clear on this issue a ground maneuver to destroy the tunnels will take somewhere between a week and two weeks and the troops deployed to the border are trained for this and prepared for this there is a small but significant amount of tunnels that weve yet to expose and theyre targets in this maneuver a ground offensive against the terror tunnels has high chances of being successful it will require confrontation with the enemy and the evacuation of civilians and will lead to the increase of rocket launching at israel but we trust the troops the solutions will come from the fighting forces on the field from the bottom not just from the army command httpwwwynetnewscomarticles07340l454381100html i will add here that trusting the troops with solutions from the bottom is very israeli data of note in a report it just released camera has revealed israel has killed mainly combatantage males not women or children a close read of the data shows that as in past hostilities the fatalities are disproportionately compared to the overall population among young males which corresponds with the characteristics of combatants males over 40 years old are also disproportionately represented some of the fatalities in those over 40 years of age likely represent senior members of terrorist organizations this contradicts media reports that tried to paint israels operation protective edge as indiscriminately killing civilians httpwwwalgemeinercom20140715watchdogaljazeerasgazafatalitiesdataindicatesisraelkilledmostlycombatantagemalesnotwomenorchildren keep praying for

Kerry was said to be coming to Cairo to participate.\n\nThis really did not have a good feel to it, and there was anxiety in several quarters here regarding what appeared to be pending capitulation by our prime minister. For word had come out that he was favoring acceptance of this proposal. Was he going to say that we had done enough, and that it was now time for ‘quiet for quiet’?\n\nFor the bottom line is that we have not done enough - I don’t care what Defense Minister Ya’alon says. Yes, there are ways in which Hamas has taken a real beating. But I’m picking up on reports that indicate that the key leaders, sitting in their underground tunnels, are alive and well and would be ready to pick up the fight again in no time. Similarly, because of the tunnels and the use of human shields, a large portion of the rockets remains intact and ready for future use. One source said we’ve destroyed one-third of their rockets. Ya’akov Amidror - who is a straight talker - says they have retained 90% of their high quality rockets.\n\nNo, it hardly time seemed like time to call it quits if there is serious intent to make sure that Hamas does not come back at us again in two years or three. Or four or five.\n\nOf course, there was always the question of what Netanyahu would demand at those truce negotiations. But yet...but yet...\n\nThis morning the prime minister called a 7:00 AM meeting of the eight-person Security Cabinet to discuss the Egyptian proposal. Word came out that they had decided to accept the proposal. Only Naftali Bennett and Avigdor Lieberman were opposed, and they were both furious. Hearts dropped, stomachs tightened, all over Israel. This looked like caving, a disastrous show of weakness. My own depression (and yes, I know what depression is) was heavy.\n\nAt 9:00 AM we stopped all attacks on Gaza.\n\nBut Hamas, adamantly and defiantly refusing the Egyptian proposal, kept right on firing rockets at us - at least 50 in the next six hours.\n\nHamas would have had trouble accepting the ceasefire because they had not achieved any significant “victories.” With their honor-shame mental-set, it would have been near impossible to do. Especially as they did not anticipate any major victory in the negotiations - no Gaza blockade lifted, no Hamas prisoners released. Their leaders actually complained about this: How can we stop when there is nothing indicated about what terms would be? All that was discussed was a readiness by Israel to open crossings to let additional supplies in.\n\nIt took six hours. At 3:00 PM, Netanyahu said, “That’s it!” He ordered attacks on Gaza to begin again, and about half an hour later they started.\n\nWell now...we were suddenly seeing something different. And perhaps quite brilliant.\n\nNetanyahu had been seeing the growing criticism of Israel around the world. The scum in Hamas, by encouraging human shields, had upped the casualties and secured multiple PR opportunities for talking about how Israel hits innocent children. (See more about this below.) In multiple quarters, there were anti-Israel voices being raised. Forgotten is the fact that Hamas started firing those rockets first. Or that we abort sorties to save children.\n\nOur prime minister (and the Cabinet?) likely saw that carrying through a major operation would have been increasingly problematic because of large scale international criticism. The dynamic needed to be changed.\n\nAnd this undoubtedly changed it. The situation was structured so that Netanyahu became a seeker of peace, the person willing to stop shooting. And Hamas was the party that sought violence even in the face of quiet.\n\nThis is what Netanyahu said at a press conference earlier today with the German foreign minister (emphasis added):\n\n\"...the refusal of Hamas to honor the ceasefire \"gives Israel full legitimacy to expand the operation to protect our people.\n\n\"We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarization of the Strip - from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels - through diplomatic means.\n\n“But if Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet.\"\n\nJohn Kerry had cancelled his trip to Cairo, because there were not going to be any ceasefire negotiations after all. From Vienna, he said (emphasis added):\n\n\"I cannot condemn strongly enough the actions of Hamas in so brazenly firing rockets in multiple numbers in the face of a goodwill effort to offer a ceasefire, in which Egypt and Israel worked together, that the international community strongly supports.\n\nHamas is \"purposely playing politics\" by continuing the rocket fire, using innocents as \"human shields... against the laws of war. And that is why they are a terrorist organization.\"\n\n \n\n http://www.jpost.com/Operation-Protective-Edge/Kerry-cancels-trip-to-Cairo-relying-on-Egyptian-brokered-ceasefire-instead-362853\n\nHow about that? He cannot tell us to use “restraint” now, can he?\n\nI’m going to stick my neck out here, with pure speculation, colored by a bit of intuition. (No one has let me in on any secrets.) I think it possible that Egypt was complicit in setting up a situation that cornered Hamas. I think this did not just “happen.” I’ve provided evidence in recent days of an Egyptian desire to have Israel take out Hamas. Their role in the current scenario has helped to make it more possible.\n\nHow far will Israel now go towards taking Hamas out? This remains to be seen. Still tonight, I hold my breath, as I wait to see what unfolds. The nation is so weary of this, and so eager to be done with Hamas.\n\nWe are being told there is a long operation likely ahead of us, and that what must be done will be done. But this tells us nothing. The prime minister says the war will intensify. Lieberman is pushing for us to take over Gaza.\n\nYNet quotes an unnamed “senior military official,” who said:\n\n“A ground offensive could help combat the many tunnels in the Strip, where the Air Force is not effective...\n\n \n\n \"Our recommendations to the political leadership were clear on this issue. A ground maneuver to destroy the tunnels will take somewhere between a week and two weeks, and the troops deployed to the border are trained for this and prepared for this. There is a small but significant amount of tunnels that we've yet to expose, and they're targets in this maneuver.\n\n[A ground offensive against the terror tunnels] \"has high chances of being successful. It will require confrontation with the enemy and the evacuation of civilians, and will lead to the increase of rocket launching at Israel, but we trust the troops. The solutions will come from the fighting forces on the field, from the bottom, not just from the army command.\"\n\nI will add here that trusting the troops with solutions from the bottom is very Israeli.\n\nIn a report it just released, CAMERA has revealed Israel has killed “mainly combatant-age males, not women or children”: a close read of the data “shows that, as in past hostilities, the fatalities are disproportionately [compared to the overall population] among young males, which corresponds with the characteristics of combatants. Males over 40 years old are also disproportionately represented. Some of the fatalities in those over 40 years of age likely represent senior members of terrorist organizations.”\n\nThis contradicts “media reports that tried to paint Israel’s Operation Protective Edge as indiscriminately killing civilians.”\n\nKeep praying for our soldiers, please! And for all of Israel.",

be they based on nationality language race politics religion or culture more broadly identifying with a subset of humanity needs no explanation we all get it but across the fault line between jews and arabs over the state of israel two alliances are looking increasingly ridiculous from the outside – that of muslim solidarity with the palestinians and angloamerican solidarity with the jews leaving aside the telling why ie of day one being marked with an israeli death the focus on the essential humanness of the deceased jews and the visceral loss and pain of their family and friends is most instructive heres channel 4 news sharing with us that gilad 16 was a movie buff and amateur pastry chef whilst eyal was a good cook who loved his sport too the idea that a slain arab would be considered in terms broader than 1 on some dead wog count is frankly laughable – and therein lies the rub indeed western media has consistently driven home two interrelated themes the jew as an eternal and uncomplicated victim and the palestinian as an eternal and uncomplicated villain heres the new york times from 2nd july 2014 distilling these essential ingredients on one page the bbc too have fallen over themselves to downplay the massive disparity in military might and scale of loss between the two sides on the 10th july after a night of bombing which led to 50 palestinian deaths and 0 israeli deaths the bbc chose a collage of four pictures to capture the state of play one of the four was of jihadis and zero were of bombed gazans later in the week bbc radio ran the headline palestinian officials say at least 192 people have been killed by israeli air strikes over the past week whilst israel says more than 1000 rockets have been fired from gaza 1921000 one presumes a headline stating 192 palestinian deaths and 0 israeli deaths would simply have been unacceptable who could blame the casual listener for concluding that israel was under existential threat and yet to give some perspective 28 israelis have been killed by gazan rocket fire since 2001 whereas in 2013 alone there were 303 traffic fatalities in israel so much for the existential threat furthermore what has not been reported by the mainstream media is just as telling whilst we are all familiar with pictures portraying the indoctrination of palestinian kids images showing the degree of hatred of israelis for palestinians have poignantly not been widely picked up to be sure the 2nd photo is of an israeli girl signing a missile destined for gaza and the 3rd is of israelis eating popcorn as they watch the show of bombs falling all this begs the glaringly obvious question – why why is israels account credited with a blank cheque of angloamerican support no matter what a similar question can be asked of the muslim ummah – why the tsunami of rage over palestine when barely a ripple registers on violent death being meted out in far greater numbers by jihadis muslims the world over have taken to the streets and marched in protest over gaza but where is the same outpouring over say boko harams insurgency which in the first half of 2014 alone led to over 2000 civilian deaths across 95 separate attacks isis are at the time of writing busy expunging iraq of its millenniaold christian community yes there has been some response but nothing like the same global outcry as over gaza thus whilst muslims are rallying under the banner of human rights it is largely the jewish context that is heating up emotion this antiimperial rather than prohuman rights stance becomes more obvious when considering the case of pakistan since 2004 the war between the pakistan army and various jihadi factions has cost nearly 50000 civilian lives and displaced up to 35m people according to the pakistan ministry of financeissued economic survey 2010–11 pakistan has never witnessed such a devastating social and economic upheaval in its industry even after dismemberment of the country by a direct war with india in 1971 and yet pakistanis get more inflamed over an american drone strike inflicting collateral damage and in probably the best example ever of smallpenis complex prime minister nawaz sharif saw fit to sidestep the myriad problems at home and assume the delusional role of global muslim champion one which presumably excludes the muslims he is killing at home in balochistan and fata in pakistan today there are madrassa graduates who await their reward of 72 virgins to fuck till eternity and all for blowing up a police station hotel or disco one hopes that whilst basic education is admittedly not as macho as saving palestine perhaps some of mr sharifs concern – and the ummahs energy and rage could be invested in that since the july 2014 israeli land incursion into gaza much international sympathy has flowed towards the palestinians they would do well to use this goodwill and not wed their future to the black flag of the jihadis for whilst the ummah remains unmoved unless blood is spilt by americans or jews their rage becomes easy to dismiss and they can offer no traction similarly unless angloamericans stop prostrating themselves before israel their claim to hold the moral high ground to be on the side of right and not might is beyond risible",

(AFP Photo / Mahmud Hams)\n\nIsrael announced it will agree to an Egyptian-backed ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the security cabinet has stated. However, the peace plan looks in ruins, with Hamas rejecting the initiative, saying “this proposal is not acceptable.”\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet had convened  to vote on the deal at Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv.  The agreement was made minutes before the proposed truce was due  to come into effect at 06:00 GMT. The ceasefire will come into  effect immediately.\n\nAmos Gilad, a senior Israeli defense official and envoy to Cairo,  cast the deal in a positive light, saying Hamas had been weakened  by the air and sea bombardment of impoverished Gaza.\n\n“Look at the balance, and you see that Hamas tried every  possible means of striking at Israel while bringing great and  terrible damage on its people, from their perspective,”  Gilad told Israel’s Army Radio. However, Hamas says it’s likely  to reject an Egyptian ceasefire proposal for the current  Israel-Gaza conflict. The militant group said it had not  officially received the text of the agreement, but believed it to  be “an initiative of kneeling and submission.”\n\nSami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official rejected the proposal  because it was deemed to be unacceptable. Previously, the  al-Qassam Brigades had shown little interest in getting to the negotiation  table.\n\n“Our battle with the enemy continues and will increase in  ferocity and intensity,” the group stated.\n\nPalestinian sources told Haaretz that despite recent declarations  by Hamas officials in opposition to the Egyptian offer, it is  possible that in the next few hours Hamas’ political leadership  will hold direct talks with Egyptian intelligence in an effort to  accept the cease-fire proposal.\n\nHamas’ political chief Khaled Meshal or his deputy Ismail Haniyeh  is expected to release an official statement later Tuesday. The  statement depends on how the talks between Hamas’ leadership and  Egypt progress in the coming hours.\n\nIsrael sees in the Egyptian-proposed Gaza truce an opportunity to  strip the Palestinian enclave of rockets but is prepared to  redouble military action there if the cross-border launches  persist, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday.\n\n“We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an  opportunity for the demilitarisation of the (Gaza) Strip – from  missiles, from rockets and from tunnels – through diplomatic  means,” he told reporters.\n\n“But if Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as  would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all  international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to  achieve the required quiet,” Netanyahu added.\n\nPalestinian militants in the Gaza Strip fired rockets at Israel  on Tuesday after the Israeli government accepted, and Hamas  Islamists said they rejected, an Egyptian-proposed ceasefire.\n\nLive television showed the Iron Dome anti-missile system  intercepting several rockets over the port city of Ashdod and  sirens sounded in other parts of southern Israel. Israel Radio  said a factory in Ashdod was hit, but there was no immediate word  of casualties.\n\nChannel Two TV said 10 rockets had been launched. The Israeli  military, which said it had stopped its attacks in Gaza, reported  before the Ashdod strike that three rockets had been fired since  the ceasefire deal was to have gone into effect.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday morning, three rockets were fired from Egypt  towards the southern Israeli resort of Eilat. Four civilians were  injured, according to Israeli security officials. They added that  they believed the rockets were fired by Islamist militants in the  Egyptian Sinai in an attempt to derail Cairo’s efforts to mediate  a truce between Israel and Palestine and put an end to the  week-long shelling of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn response to the Egyptian proposal, Hamas spokesman Fawzi  Barhoum said on Monday that his movement would not accept any  truce that excludes the conditions of the Palestinian groups and  people, as quoted by Israeli media.\n\nIn a televised address, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh praised the  role of Hamas fighters and denounced the Israeli bombardment of  the Gaza Strip.\n\n“The problem is not the truce, but the siege and starvation  of Gaza Strip,” Haniyeh stressed. “The problem is not  going back to the agreement on calm because we want this  aggression to stop.”\n\nSince the start of Israel’s military operation on Tuesday, 184  people – mostly civilians – have been killed by airstrikes in  Gaza, Palestinian medics said.",

survival of the state of israel 2 condemns the unprovoked rocket fire at israel and 3 calls on hamas to immediately cease all rocket and other attacks against israel the senate version repeats those three demands in almost identical wording and adds a fourth calls on palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas to dissolve the unity governing arrangement with hamas and condemn the attacks on israel what the congressional resolutions overlook is that hamas has officially renounced its responsibility for governing gaza while the palestinian unity government has already begun the process of taking over the administration of gaza over a week ago july 56 a senior hamas official ahmad yousef was asked about increased rocket fire on israel in recent weeks in an interview with palestinian news agency maan his answer from a political point of view prime minister rami hamdallah is responsible and he can give orders to security services to intervene hamas is not ruling the gaza strip and so its not responsible for protecting borders anyone paying due attention to recent palestinian developments should know that this is correct the unity government was formed because hamas no longer had the funds to pay its own administration of 40000 employees in gaza this was because the new egyptian regime closed the tunnels connecting egypt with gaza and removed hamass two chief sources of income money smuggled through the tunnels and taxes imposed upon the operators of the tunnels on the other hand the 70000 employees of the palestinian authority pa in gaza despite being dismissed by hamas in 2007 have continued to receive their salaries from the pa until today the unity government returned the first 3000 of them to their posts already in may the agreement between the pa and hamas also stipulates that the 40000 hamas exemployees should soon be integrated into the unity administration some pa officials specifically mofid alhasayneh have expressly affirmed this obligation while others have so far blocked payments to those exemployees but that is the intention consequently the pa – not hamas – should be the primary addressee of congressional resolutions moreover it is not enough to back israels military actions against rocket fire what is needed is an international plan modelled on the elimination of syrias chemical weapons with two defined aims to eliminate gazas entire arsenal of rockets and the capacity to produce them and to eliminate the tunnels that hamas has built underground from gaza into israeli territory in order to kidnap more israelis or whatever that double demand was already made in two previous articles here on june 13 and on june 24 along with the need for such an international plan it was also pointed out that congress has the power to impose that demand upon the pa as a condition of further financial support for the pa that is instead of demanding the dissolution of the palestinian unity government as the senate resolution states congress should demand that the unity government shoulder its responsibility to eliminate both the rocket infrastructure in gaza and the tunnels in the meantime the israeli government has come round to the view expressed in those two articles this was first reported on july 14 in the online times of israel the demands israel is presenting as part of truce negotiations at least since friday are that hamas accept the terms of the 2012 agreement that came after operation pillar of defense empty the gaza strip of rockets and close down the tunnels that run between the coastal enclave and israel that is a month after the publication of the first article official israel has settled for the same double demand upon the palestinians only it still addresses that demand to hamas since it is too embarrassing to admit that the pas unity government is now the designated ruler in gaza a day later july 15 prime minister netanyahu confirmed that the double demand is indeed now israeli policy speaking of the ceasefire proposed by egypt he told reporters we agreed to the egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarisation of the gaza strip from missiles from rockets and from tunnels through diplomatic means netanyahu went on to threaten that if hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal as would now seem to be the case israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet yet israel should keep this in mind each time that it destroys the hamas rocket capacities and hamas rebuilds them it remains an israeli responsibility to destroy them again but if the official palestinian government now accepts responsibility for cooperation in the destruction of the rockets and tunnels then the palestinians will have recognized their responsibility to prevent also any recurrence of such phenomena malcolm lowe poses the question of who should and will be responsible for clearing gaza of thousands of rockets image source idf note that this was precisely the result of assads agreement to cooperate in the elimination of syrias chemical weapons assad is deterred from restarting production because he knows that the entire international community will not tolerate it had merely the us bombed some facilities in syria then the reconstruction of those facilities would have been seen as merely an american problem this has implications not only today in gaza but also for any future arrangements in the west bank by accepting responsibility for rockets and tunnels in gaza the pa will be on notice that it is not allowed to tolerate anything of the kind in the west bank either so israel would be advised to hold off or strictly limit a ground incursion in gaza for the moment while if it takes over the gaza strip entirely it will become responsible for feeding a million and a half penniless palestinians notable is also the counterdemand made by hamas quoted in the times of israel report hamas is demanding that 56 prisoners who were released as part of the 2011 prisoner swap for idf soldier gilad shalit and were rearrested in the west bank following the june 12 abduction and killing of the three israeli teenagers be freed the terror organization is also asking that the rafah crossing to egypt be opened and that the salaries of 40000 former hamas employees be transferred to the gaza strip this is confirmation indeed that recent events take their start from the bankruptcy of hamas this terrorist organization can no longer pay or feed anyone in gaza it was promised that its 40000 activists would get paid by the pa but the pa – which is itself nearly bankrupt – has so far not complied so the last resort of hamas was to start firing the thousands of accumulated rockets finally we can ask how many palestinians does it take to change a light bulb in gaza apparently 40000 hamas employees are capable of doing the work of 70000 pa employees add them together and there will be at least three of them to change that light bulb the palestinian president mahmoud abbas evidently has on his payroll tens of thousands of idle gazans who are available to root out and destroy those rockets and tunnels tell them all that this is the only way to get paid and feed their families – and why should they refuse related topics israel malcolm lowe receive the

            "text": "How Congress Can Help Israel Against Hamas\n\nWhat the Congressional resolutions overlook is that Hamas has officially renounced its responsibility for governing Gaza, while the Palestinian unity government has already begun the process of taking over the administration of Gaza. Consequently, the Palestinian Authority – not Hamas – should be the primary addressee of Congressional resolutions. Congress has the power to impose that demand upon the PA as a condition of further financial support for the PA. The Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, evidently has on his payroll tens of thousands of idle Gazans who are available to root out and destroy those rockets and tunnels.\n\nLast Friday, July 11, the US House of Representatives unanimously passed Resolution 657 in support of Israel's right to defend itself against the rockets fired from the Gaza strip. A similar resolution has also been submitted to the US Senate. This reaffirmation of American support will be deeply appreciated in Israel. To make that support effective, however, a little more will be needed.\n\nThe House version \"(1) reaffirms its support for Israel's right to defend its citizens and ensure the survival of the State of Israel; (2) condemns the unprovoked rocket fire at Israel; and (3) calls on Hamas to immediately cease all rocket and other attacks against Israel.\" The Senate version repeats those three demands in almost identical wording and adds a fourth: \"Calls on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to dissolve the unity governing arrangement with Hamas and condemn the attacks on Israel.\"\n\nWhat the Congressional resolutions overlook is that Hamas has officially renounced its responsibility for governing Gaza, while the Palestinian unity government has already begun the process of taking over the administration of Gaza. Over a week ago (July 5/6), a senior Hamas official, Ahmad Yousef, was \"asked about increased rocket fire on Israel in recent weeks\" in an interview with Palestinian news agency Ma'an. His answer: \"From a political point of view, (Prime Minister) Rami Hamdallah is responsible and he can give orders to security services to intervene. Hamas is not ruling the Gaza Strip and so it's not responsible for protecting borders\"\n\nAnyone paying due attention to recent Palestinian developments should know that this is correct. The unity government was formed because Hamas no longer had the funds to pay its own administration of 40,000 employees in Gaza. This was because the new Egyptian regime closed the tunnels connecting Egypt with Gaza and removed Hamas's two chief sources of income: money smuggled through the tunnels and taxes imposed upon the operators of the tunnels.\n\nOn the other hand, the 70,000 employees of the Palestinian Authority [PA] in Gaza, despite being dismissed by Hamas in 2007, have continued to receive their salaries from the PA until today. The unity government returned the first 3,000 of them to their posts already in May. The agreement between the PA and Hamas also stipulates that the 40,000 Hamas ex-employees should soon be integrated into the unity administration. Some PA officials (specifically Mofid al-Hasayneh) have expressly affirmed this obligation, while others have so far blocked payments to those ex-employees, but that is the intention.\n\nConsequently, the PA – not Hamas – should be the primary addressee of Congressional resolutions. Moreover, it is not enough to back Israel's military actions against rocket fire. What is needed is an international plan, modelled on the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons, with two defined aims: to eliminate Gaza's entire arsenal of rockets and the capacity to produce them, and to eliminate the tunnels that Hamas has built underground from Gaza into Israeli territory (in order to kidnap more Israelis, or whatever).\n\nThat double demand was already made in two previous articles here on June 13 and on June 24, along with the need for such an international plan. It was also pointed out that Congress has the power to impose that demand upon the PA as a condition of further financial support for the PA. That is, instead of demanding the dissolution of the Palestinian unity government, as the Senate resolution states, Congress should demand that the unity government shoulder its responsibility to eliminate both the rocket infrastructure in Gaza and the tunnels.\n\nIn the meantime, the Israeli government has come round to the view expressed in those two articles.

But if the official Palestinian government now accepts responsibility for cooperation in the destruction of the rockets and tunnels, then the Palestinians will have recognized their responsibility to prevent also any recurrence of such phenomena.\n\nNote that this was precisely the result of Assad's agreement to cooperate in the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons.

Had merely the US bombed some facilities in Syria, then the reconstruction of those facilities would have been seen as merely an American problem.\n\nThis has implications not only today in Gaza but also for any future arrangements in the West Bank. By accepting responsibility for rockets and tunnels in Gaza, the PA will be on notice that it is not allowed to tolerate anything of the kind in the West Bank either. So Israel would be advised to hold off, or strictly limit, a ground incursion in Gaza for the moment. While if it takes over the Gaza Strip entirely, it will become responsible for feeding a million and a half penniless Palestinians.\n\nNotable is also the counter-demand made by Hamas, quoted in the Times of Israel report: \"Hamas is demanding that 56 prisoners who were released as part of the 2011 prisoner swap for IDF soldier Gilad Shalit, and were rearrested in the West Bank following the June 12 abduction and killing of the three Israeli teenagers, be freed.

It was promised that its 40,000 activists would get paid by the PA, but the PA – which is itself nearly bankrupt – has so far not complied. So the last resort of Hamas was to start firing the thousands of accumulated rockets.\n\nFinally, we can ask: How many Palestinians does it take to change a light bulb in Gaza? Apparently, 40,000 Hamas employees are capable of doing the work of 70,000 PA employees. Add them together and there will be at least three of them to change that light bulb. The Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, evidently has on his payroll tens of thousands of idle Gazans who are available to root out and destroy those rockets and tunnels. Tell them all that this is the only way to get paid and feed their families – and why should they refuse?\n\nRelated Topics:  Israel  |  Malcolm Lowe receive the latest by email: subscribe to the free gatestone institute mailing list",

Ground fighting would mean Israeli casualties too.\n\nBut if air power doesn't prove decisive, the political pressure for him to go further will grow.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) dropped leaflets and used recorded telephone messages to warn some 100,000 residents of Gaza to leave their homes before 08:00 (05:00 GMT) on Wednesday.\n\nThe warning came as militants continued to fire rockets at Israeli cities, the IDF said, adding that its Iron Dome missile shield had intercepted 10, including four launched at Tel Aviv.\n\nThe military said militants had fired more than 150 rockets into Israel on Tuesday, and more than 1,260 since Operation Protective Edge began.\n\nThe air force and navy had carried out strikes on 96 targets in Gaza on Tuesday, and more than 1,750 in the past eight days, it added.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas had \"shut the door to a diplomatic solution\" and bore \"sole responsibility for the continuation of the violence\".\n\nThe Egyptian-backed truce was to have started on Tuesday morning, after it was approved by Israel's security cabinet.\n\nThe ceasefire should have been followed by a series of meetings in Cairo with high-level delegations from the two sides.\n\nIsraeli attacks were halted for six hours, but resumed amid continuing rocket fire directed at Israel. Among those reported killed overnight was a five-month-old baby.\n\nLater on Wednesday, Palestinian medics said four children had been killed in an air raid west of Gaza City.\n\nHamas - which is designated a terrorist organisation by Israel and the US among others- said the terms of the ceasefire did not address concerns over the economic blockade of the Gaza strip, which has caused severe economic hardship for many Palestinians.\n\nSenior Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan told the BBC the group had only heard about the truce initiative through the media, and that a ceasefire could not be put in place without the details of any agreement being known.\n\nThe armed wing of Hamas, the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades, dismissed the initiative, saying its battle with Israel would \"increase in ferocity and intensity\".\n\nMr Netanyahu has come under criticism in Israel for accepting the truce initiative. His office announced that deputy defence minister Danny Danon had been sacked for comments branding the PM a \"failure\".\n\nIsrael has mobilised tens of thousands of troops on the border with Gaza amid speculation a ground invasion could be launched.\n\nThe UN says at least 1,370 homes have been destroyed in Gaza and more than 18,000 people displaced in recent hostilities.\n\nThe International Red Cross warned that repeated bombing was devastating Gaza's \"fragile water infrastructure\", with hundreds of people left without water.\n\nAre you in the area?",

charge d affaires the highestranking turkish official in the country over the comments it said turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is driven by narrow ideological interests referencing turkeys support to the muslim brotherhood group branded as a terrorist organization in egypt the continuation of the insults against egypt and its elected leadership will undoubtedly lead to more measures from egypt leading to limited progress of bilateral relations the statement said relations between egypt and turkey soured after al sisi led the ouster of islamist president mohammed morsi a brotherhood leader egypt expelled turkish ambassador in cairo and withdrew its ambassador in turkey after it called for morsi release from prison source the wall street journal saturday 26 july aljazeeras peter greste to appeal over egypt conviction jailed aljazeera journalist peter greste is to appeal against his conviction and sevenyear jail term on terrorismrelated charges in egypt his brother mike has said in a statement it said that the family were strong and confident of a successful outcome and determined to fight its cause mr greste and two aljazeera colleagues were jailed in june for defaming egypt and helping outlawed islamists the case triggered an international outcry and demands for a pardon mr greste argued soon after his conviction that the prosecutor had consistently failed to present a single piece of concrete evidence to support the outrageous allegations against him and his codefendants canadianegyptian mohamed fahmy and egyptian national baher mohamed in a more recent statement released with baher mohammed he said that he was so shocked after hearing the guilty verdicts that he felt punchdrunk it is not clear whether mr grestes codefendants are also appealing chaotic trial at least part of our strength comes from the understanding that this isnt just about those wrongly convicted in our case this is about press freedom about freedom of speech not just in egypt but globally the statement released by the greste family on friday said mr greste and his two codefendants were convicted of aiding the muslim brotherhood a group designated as terrorists by the egyptian government egyptian president abdel fattah alsisi rapidly ruled out hopes that he might pardon the trio in the aftermath of the trial a decision which mr grestes family said left them with no option but to try to win his freedom through the criminal justice appeal system today we wish to announce we intend to appeal the verdict through the formal channels offered by the egyptian legal system mike greste said in brisbane it wasnt a decision that was made lightly correspondents say such an appeal could take months to work its way through the ranks of the egyptian

australian national and former bbc correspondent source bbc news friday 25 july egypt sides with israel in conflict with hamas an echo of the antihamas rhetoric coming from israel during its conflict with gaza is resonating from what many would consider a surprising corner since fighting erupted july 8 egypt a country whose leader just over a year ago had been a close hamas ally is now one of its principal antagonists it is stirring up public opinion against the militant group because hamas is the palestinian branch of the muslim brotherhood which egypt has outlawed normally egyptians would be decrying israel for the palestinian death toll in gaza which is at more than 750 and rising but abou ahmed shehab 60 who sells scarves at a sidewalk stand in central cairo was quick to attack hamas the reason for whats happening to our palestinian brothers is because of hamas he says hamas is an extremist group last summer the egyptian military ousted muslim brotherhood leader mohammed morsi as president and jailed him it branded the islamist group a terrorist organization and threw thousands of its leaders and members in jail hundreds were killed as the islamic movement became the focus of a security crackdown since then a militarybacked government that is now led by abdel fattah alsisi who went from military strongman to elected president this past spring has succeeded in stoking antiislamist sentiment among a large swathe of egypts public both staterun and privately owned media have helped fuel the antihamas attitudes hamas has terrible policies and the outcomes of those policies are being felt by women and children said taxi driver medhat kamel 40 about civilian deaths in gaza they rely on violence and dont use dialogue from a political standpoint hamas is criticized in egypt for its unwise ways of managing the crisis with israel said mustapha al sayyid a political science professor at both cairo university and the american university in cairo last week hamas rejected an egyptian ceasefire initiative saying it wasnt consulted and the proposal wouldnt end an israeli and egyptian blockade of hamasruled gaza which is suffering economically as a result egypts hostility toward gaza may be one reason hamas lamented last week that it feels alone in battling israel without support from the arab region todays situation is different from 2012 the last conflict between israel and hamas at the time morsi brokered a ceasefire that hamas accepted two years later the egyptian government which has accused hamas of helping militants attack soldiers and police in egypt is doing little to help the palestinians its keeping its rafah border crossing with gaza closed even preventing a humanitarian aid convoy from crossing khaled fahmy chair of the history department at the american university in cairo has observed a sea change in public discussion about hamas recently there has been an alarming outpouring in the past two weeks not only dumbing down and toning down criticism of israel but also — in fact — a very very sharp increase in vitriolic racist discourse against palestinians and hamas in particular fahmy said last week an egyptian writer

proposal advanced by egypt and agreed to by israel i think you can just conclude theres one group that is fully and entirely responsible for this tragedy and it is hamas he said theyre responsible and they can stop this at any moment hamas wants easing of border blockade israeli defence minister moshe yaalon said the gaza military operation would have no time limit if needed we will recruit more reservists in order to continue the operation as long as necessary until the completion of the task and the return of the quiet in the whole of israel especially from the threat of the gaza strip yaalon told a parliamentary committee israel accepted an egyptian call for an unconditional ceasefire last week but resumed its offensive after hamas rejected the proposal ban and kerry were in egypt to try to salvage that ceasefire proposal hamas with some support from qatar and turkey wants guarantees that israel and egypt will significantly ease a sevenyear border blockade of gaza before halting fire the resistance hamas will not respond to any pressure hamas spokesman sami abu zuhri said in a text message in a reference to the renewed ceasefire efforts hamas remains deeply suspicious of the motives of the egyptian government which banned the hamasfriendly muslim brotherhood a year ago and tightened restrictions on gaza — to the point of driving hamas into its worst financial crisis since its founding in 1987 when asked about such conditions ban told reporters monday in cairo that the best way at this time is to stop the violence and return to dialogue and address the root causes of the problems i am asking again without any condition they must stop he said i know that this proposal by egyptian government has been rejected because of certain conditions if they really want to discuss all these conditions they will take a very long time deadliest single day sunday marked the single deadliest day in gaza since the conflict erupted on july 8 with more than 100 palestinians killed according to palestinian health officials most died in the first major ground battle of the conflict in gaza citys shijaiyah neighbourhood which israel says is a major source for rocket fire against its civilians in response to the escalation the un security council expressed serious concern about the rising civilian death toll and demanded an immediate end to the fighting on sunday afternoon rescue workers making a last sweep through shijaiyah had heard the voice of a woman under the rubble pleading for help the team left because it deemed the situation too dangerous but returned later sunday with a bulldozer to rescue the three people trapped underneath sevenyearold bissam dhaher her face bruised and bandaged was recovering monday at gaza citys shifa hospital relatives watched over her as the girl slept her uncle remained hospitalized while an aunt — the one who had called out for help — was released relatives said on sunday evening hamas spokesman mushir almasri in gaza claimed his group had captured an israeli soldier an announcement on gaza tv of the soldiers capture set off celebration in the streets of west bank but there was no official confirmation or denial of the claim in israel for israelis a captured soldier would be a nightmare scenario hamasallied militants seized an israeli soldier in a crossborder raid in 2006 and held him captive in gaza until israel traded more than 1000 palestinian prisoners some of whom were involved in grisly killings for his return in 2011 source cbc news monday 21 july split between egypt and hamas plagues efforts to bring ceasefire to gaza even as the death toll mounts in the gaza strip attempts to broker a ceasefire between hamas and israel have so far run aground — in part because they have become mired in the deep divisions between mideast countries at the center of the problems is the bitter enmity between egypt and its gulf allies like saudi arabia on one side and gazas hamas rulers and its allies turkey and qatar on the other an egyptian ceasefire proposal quickly fell apart the past week when israel accepted it but hamas rejected it hamas demanded greater guarantees for the lifting of the blockade of gaza enforced by israel and egypt the egyptian proposal called for both sides to halt hostilities unconditionally — dangling only a promise of further talks that could address the closure qatarbased hamas spokesman hossam badran described cairos ceasefire proposal as all but dead calling it a surrender to israel he and other hamas officials said they were instead turning to qatar which they said had an initiative that would address their demands including release of prisoners and giving unfettered access to the densely populated strip that quickly sparked accusations by egypt that hamas allies were undermining it the hamasqatarturkey axis is trying to abort egypts role which is the region bulwark in the face of a plot aimed at fragmenting the region into rival ministates egypts foreign minister sameh shukri told reporters thursday night just before israel announced the start of its ground assault into gaza shukri said egypt is in a very tense and difficult relationship with hamas where reaching common ground is nearly impossible on saturday shukri said he knows of no other initiative and that the egyptian initiative remains the initiative on the table with international supportspeaking next to visiting french foreign minister laurent fabius shukri said there was no intention to amend the proposal which he said meets the demands of both sides the tensions are rooted in the turmoil in egypt over the past year hamas spawned off the muslim brotherhood which egypts government has branded a terrorist organization since the militarys ouster of islamist president mohammed morsi last summer egyptian authorities have been cracking down hard on morsis brotherhood and accuse hamas of helping islamic militants waging a campaign of violence in egypt a claim the group denies egypt also has tightened the closure on gaza by destroying smuggling tunnels under the border that were largely propping up the strips economy that has thrown hamas into a financial crisis turkey and qatar were also close allies of morsi and the brotherhood — and the result has been deep tensions between them and the government of egyptian president abdelfattah elsissi the former army chief that ousted morsi the ceasefire plan put forth by egypt now is virtually identical to one presented by morsi during the last round of gaza fighting at the time both sides accepted the accord and morsi was lauded for his mediation now however there is not only deep mistrust in the way but also increased hamas expectations for an end to the stifling blockade badran told the associated press that hamas wants the permanent opening of the rafah crossing with egypt an arrangement to allow gazans to pray in alaqsa mosque in jerusalem and the release of political prisoners held by israel hamas and its allies qatar and turkey also are pressing for the opening of an airport and seaport in gaza under international administration we have to impose conditions and guarantees to prevent the recurring of this assault and lift this inhumane and illogical blockade on gaza qatari foreign minister khalid alattiya said in a speech last week turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu has said the blockade must be lifted if a tunnel is closed an airport has to be opened there has to be a breathing space the situation now is beyond a ghetto he said in an interview thursday with turkeys ntv television however egypt — as well as hamas rival palestinian president mahmoud abbas — is wary of any moves that would give hamas breathing room and strengthen its hold on gaza there is no way egypt is going to let the crossing open for hamas to come and go without control an egyptian foreign ministry official said he said egypt could agree to international observers — or forces from abbas palestinian authority — controlling the crossing as long as they are on the gaza side the official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists sameh seif alyazel a security expert and onetime member of elsissis presidential campaign said egypt would accept arrangements giving free movement in and out of gaza as long as they are endorsed by the palestinian authority egypt is siding with the palestinian authority and the palestinian people not hamas he said abbas has backed the egyptian proposal saying it is identical to the 2012 ceasefire brokered by morsi after visiting cairo abbas left to turkey where he is expected to meet with hamas top leader khaled mashaal before heading to qatar and other gulf countries in an attempt to bridge the gaps turkey meanwhile has denied undermining egypts efforts turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan angrily denounced elsissi saying he is an oppressor a coup leader he is the person who has been blocking hamas routes soon after morsis ouster egypt and turkey recalled their ambassadors egypt also shut down qatarowned satellite news network aljazeeras bureau there accusing it of being a mouthpiece for the brotherhood throughout the current gaza crisis egypts media — which is overwhelmingly supportive of elsissi — has been sharply critical of hamas tv stations have accused hamas of wasting palestinian blood and commercializing the palestinian cause the editor in chief of the stateowned alahram on saturday accused hamas and its allies of seeking to stir public opinion against elsissi and his government by prolonging the conflict with israel in one recent program fiercely promilitary television presenter tawfiq okasha described hamas and those who show any sympathy for it as dogs and waved his shoes in a show of contempt for those who dont appreciate egypts weight source associated news thursday 17 july can egypt deliver a ceasefire between israel and hamas critics say egypt was slow to respond to the current crisis and its initial efforts have faltered add to that the open mistrust being demonstrated by the key palestinian faction hamas and it doesnt look like a winning formula but the warfare looks certain to give way to a ceasefire and cairo is still the most likely broker i dont see anyone else who can play that role said the arab league secretary general nabil alarabi a former foreign minister of egypt if anyone else wants to help let him try difficult to engage during the last major eruption of violence between israel and the hamas in november 2012 egypt played its traditional role as mediatorat that time it was well placed to broker a trucethe president mohammed morsi was an islamist with fraternal ties to hamas an offshoot of his muslim brotherhoodnow mr morsi is in jail and the new egyptian authorities regard hamas as a terrorist group that is certainly a complication its very difficult for egypt to engage with hamas as it used to says h a hellyer of the royal united services institute rusi egypt is engaged in what it considers to be a war on terror which involves hamas as part of the muslim brotherhood so the population of gaza is collateral damage in two wars on terror israels and egypts when news of egypts ceasefire proposal emerged on monday night it came as a surprise to many apparently including the leadership of hamas these days egypt has better relations with israel than with the islamists who run gaza some analysts believe that initially at least cairo was happy to see hamas under attack there is little doubt that egypts security establishment would like to see hamas crushed as it has crushed the brotherhood but egypt can not afford to wash its hands of hamas if someone else manages to do a deal without egypt that would dent the prestige of the new egyptian president abdul fattah alsisi fractured leadership hamas is unlikely to sign up to anything without the endorsement of its regional ally qatar but egypt will not include the qataris because of their support for the brotherhood the us secretary of state john kerry is expected to act as a gobetween he is due in cairo on friday one of the difficulties is securing a truce is that the hamas leadership is fractured physically and politically some senior figures are in hiding and others are in exile there are differences within hamas said one egyptian official we dont think exiled political leader khaled meshaal can control the leadership in gaza or the military wing we cant have a conversation with every jack joe and harry he believes the deal will be done when israel has finished what it wants to finish and when hamas has come to the point of collapse that may not take too long gaining momentum the arab leagues secretary general believes that hamas will agree to the egyptian proposal with some crucial extras one of their key demands is the opening of gazas borders ending blockades by both israel and egypt even if a ceasefire is hammered out mr arabi believes it will not last unless there is political progress towards an independent palestinian state even if this truce holds in a couple of months we will find something else the message for the outside world is that what we need now is an end to israels occupation to have the two state solution after a shaky start it is clear that diplomatic efforts are gaining momentum the palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas is already in cairo along with delegations from qatar and israel israeli air strikes have killed more than 200 palestinians in the past 10 days more than 80 of them civilians according to the united nations but israel moved adroitly to agree to the ceasefire soon after it was proposed in contrast to hamas next time a deal is put forward hamas may have little real choice but to sign up or bear the blame for further bloodshed alone source bbc news wednesday 16 july israel accepts egypts ceasefire plan – but hamas vows to keep fighting despite previously acknowledging some diplomatic movement hamas rejected egypts ceasefire plan for the latest israelipalestinian conflict on tuesday — just moments after israel accepted the proposal a statement released by hamas armed wing alqassam brigades said the group totally and completely rejected the terms of an egyptian brokered cease fire adding that without further concessions from israel it was not worth the ink it was written with representatives from islamic jihad which also has been involved in the fighting also rejected an unconditional ceasefire roughly four hours after israels security cabinet announced that it had accepted the cease fire israel said a fresh volley of 35 rockets were fired from gaza into southern israel causing minor damage cairos proposal aimed to stop a weeklong conflict that has seen at least 185 gazans killed the truce called for a 48hour cessation of fire followed by immediate talks for a longerterm truce and an eventual opening of gazas border crossing the new york times reports the associated press reports that a senior hamas official sami abu zuhri said egypts plan for a ceasefire in gaza was not acceptable alqassam brigades said on the website that excerpts from the plan published in the media indicated it was an initiative of kneeling and submission reports reuters our battle with the enemy continues and will increase in ferocity and intensity alqassam brigades added source time tuesday 15 july israel has accepted an egyptian truce proposal for the conflict with gaza hamas which controls gaza is still discussing the plan but its armed wing has rejected it as a surrender under the terms the ceasefire should begin immediately followed by a series of meetings in cairo with highlevel delegations from both sides palestinian officials say at least 192 people have been killed by israeli air strikes launched eight days ago to stop militants firing rockets into israelthere have been no israeli air strikes into gaza since the 0900 0600 gmt truce but israel says more than 20 rockets have been fired from gaza into israel after the deadline analysis kevin connolly bbc middle east correspondent jerusalem if hamas continues to reject the deal then the israelis will feel they emerge from the breakdown holding the diplomatic high ground noone can be sure whats happening behind the scenes between hamas and egypt hamas has both political and military wings and some leaders who are not in gaza and communications are difficult with many senior officials in hiding during the israeli air raids so establishing the groups definitive answer may take a little time although were clear on the views of military leaders inside the enclave that the egyptian proposal is a surrender the palestinian militant group needs some sort of political win from this confrontation after all the suffering and destruction its people have gone through the likeliest area of compromise would be some sort of easing of the tight economic restrictions on gaza for which israel and egypt are jointly responsible but theres no guarantee of success for now we remain alert israels security cabinet convened by prime minister benjamin netanyahu approved the truce on tuesday morning minutes before the proposed time for it to come into effect we agreed to the egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarisation of the gaza strip from missiles from rockets and from tunnels through diplomatic means mr netanyahu told reporters but he added if hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal as would now seem to be the case israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet peter lerner a spokesman for the idf israels military said in accordance with the government directives the idf now holds fire we remain alert and preserve high preparedness levels both defensive and offensive the bbcs kevin connolly says that israels rapid acceptance of the egyptian ceasefire proposal is striking and represents a smart tactical move if the deal holds then israel will be happy with the outcome our correspondent says because it has damaged stockpiles of weapons that hamas will find difficult to replenish and it will have quiet on its border with gaza for now hamas sources are saying its attacks will increase in ferocity and intensity unless israel releases prisoners and cooperates with egypt to lift economic restrictions on gaza that is not encouraging but does not mean that a deal will not ultimately be done just that it will not be easy our correspondent says meanwhile the casualty figures continue to mount three people were killed in khan younis south of gaza on tuesday morning shortly before israel accepted the proposed truce of the 192 now reported dead by the palestinian health authority the un estimates that over threequarters were civilians an estimated 1400 palestinians have been injured israel disputes the palestinian casualty figures saying they were based on hamas sources and were not objective at least four israelis have been seriously injured since the violence flared but noone has been killed israeli sources said at least three rockets landed in and around the southern israeli city of eilat overnight reports suggest they may have been fired from the sinai peninsula in egypt rather than from gaza source bbc news monday 14 july eight killed in blasts in egypts sinai region one security officer and seven others were killed in two successive explosions around security areas in egypts sinai region near the border with israel the interior ministry and security officials said egypt has been hit by an islamist insurgency led by sinaibased militants who have mainly targeted security forces since last years army ouster of elected islamist president mohamed mursi hundreds of soldiers and police officers have been killed in those attacks the interior ministry said seven people were killed and around 25 others were injured in an explosion security sources said the rocket was targeting north sinais main security compound but instead fell in front of a nearby crowded supermarket in sinais northern city of alarish a few minutes later two rockets hit a security unit in the same city killing an officer and injuring seven others medical sources said the army ousted mursi last july after mass protests against his rule the move was followed by a crackdown on islamists in which hundreds of street protesters were killed and thousands of islamist leaders and activists were jailed egypts newly elected president abdel fattah alsisi the former army chief who orchestrated mursis overthrow has promised to fight what he calls terrorism and restore stability to the arab worlds most populous state source reuters saturday 12 july egyptians uncertain about future under president sisi a year ago many hailed him as their saviour for overthrowing president mohammed morsi and the muslim brotherhood they elected him president in may with a 97 majority of votes cast now egyptians are trying to find out how retired field marshalturnedpresident abdul fattah alsisi plans to tackle egypts problems puzzling personality for a man who has effectively been in power for a year president sisi has revealed little about himself and above all about his vision for egypt he was not elected on the basis of his programme one aide says he did not present one until the very end of the campaign in order to avoid unnecessary debate and controversy nor was he elected on the basis of his charisma a military man all his life he comes across as serious and dignified but not inspiring he is not an eloquent public speaker although people who meet him find him sincere and convincing he was elected above all for having overthrown president morsi a year later most egyptians are still happy about the demise of mr morsi but somewhat puzzled about mr sisi during a recent trip the questions i asked egyptian politicians analysts and businessmen about president sisis policies elicited remarkably numerous answers along the lines of i really do not know including from people who repeatedly participated in meetings with him the first few weeks of mr sisis presidency have begun to provide glimpses into his personality or at least the public persona he has chosenthey have also given some indication about his political views but have revealed almost nothing about how he intends to tackle urgent economic problems leading by example mr sisi wants to be seen as a serious honest hardworking and pious president during the election campaign he repeatedly warned egyptians of the hard work ahead and he is continuing to do so now president sisi tells egyptians to cycle and walk more to save the country money he has told his ministers they must set an example by being in the office by 0700 he emphasises the contribution individuals can make towards solving egypts problems if people rode their bicycles or walked to work he says they would save the country millions in oil imports his actions leave no doubt he prefers order and discipline over individual choice he has announced that he is donating half his salary and half his personal assets to support the egyptian economy a move that will force senior officials and prominent businessmen to do the same in fact the defence minister has already announced the military will donate 140m £82m he has ordered the ministry of finance to enforce rules on maximum wages he talks about the importance of religion and leaves no room for doubt about his own commitment to islam his forehead bears the mark that develops when a person prays regularly he has stressed that egypt is committed to correcting the religious discourse and freeing it from extremism new initiatives and laws many announced by the outgoing interim president adly mansour after the election but before the inauguration of mr sisi convey the same messages about rectitude and morality egypts ministry of youth and sports has declared it will combat atheism among young people the ministry of interior has banned religious slogans on vehicles the interior minister also says hell form a new department that will handle sexual assault cases and mr sisi has already demonstrated his personal interest in the issue by being photographed on a hospital visit to a woman receiving treatment after an assault in cairos tahrir square during his inauguration celebrations topdown political control on the political front however the message from the president and his government is one of strict topdown control over all aspects of life during the election campaign mr sisi said democracy in egypt would be impossible for at least 25 years his actions too leave no doubt that he prefers order and discipline over individual choice the laws governing the forthcoming parliamentary elections guarantee a weak parliament because they favour individual candidates over political parties with about 25 of ordinary egyptians living below the poverty line and a similar percentage hovering just above it he must act soon mr sisi has established a supreme council for legislative reform by decree which will be able to draft new laws and leave the parliament to do the rubberstamping he has also tightened control over religion and education only preachers licensed by alazhar one of the main centres of sunni muslim learning will be allowed to deliver sermons and mr sisi will personally appoint university presidents and deans repression of the muslim brotherhood continues with over a thousand members sentenced to death by the courts in summary trials young people who defy the antiprotest law brought in last december have been given tough sentences so have aljazeera journalists accused of fabricating stories even street vendors and people who litter have been targeted in an effort to clean up the cities uncertainty over economy on the most important challenge he faces reviving the economy president sisi has sent out very few and contradictory signals and with about 25 of ordinary egyptians living below the poverty line and a similar percentage hovering just above it he must act soon after his election win president sisi tells egyptians it is now time to work to rebuild the economy the business community is waiting for clear signals about his intentions even saudi arabia the united arab emirates and kuwait all countries which have poured billions into the egyptian economy since president morsis overthrow are hinting they will not continue their support indefinitely particularly if egypt does not adopt clear policies and major reforms mr sisi has done neither his approach is confusing he states the private sector has a role to play if not a duty to invest but he remains committed to the state sector and has put the military in charge of managing the massive housing projects financed by the united arab emirates above all the government can not reach a decision on the urgently needed reform of food and energy subsidies which occupy a third of the budget p lans are periodically announced but never implemented in case they lead to unrest egypts economic growth forecast is far too low to alleviate poverty for its rapidly growing population the latest announcement on 30 june that the government will slash energy subsidies by the equivalent of 56bn £33 bn was typically vague savings will be achieved through redistribution and restructuring he has said but without a timetable egyptians still have a lot to discover about their new president source bbc news marina ottaway marina ottaway is a senior scholar at the woodrow wilson center and a longtime analyst of political transformations in africa the balkans and the middle east friday 11 july egypt opens border with gaza egypt says it has opened its border crossing with gaza to allow the most critical casualties of israeli airstrikes access to egyptian medical care following accusations that it has abandoned its usual role of mediating between the israeli and palestinian leaderships the opening of the border accompanied statements by egyptian officials that stressed egypts active role in bringing the latest gaza conflict which palestinians say has killed over 70 gazans to an end the spokesman for egypts foreign ministry badr abdelatty told the guardian we have extensive and full contact with all parties concerned either directly or internationally our main objective is to stop israeli aggression we are in full contact and pushing very hard to provide all humanitarian assistance to the palestinians in gaza abdelattys comments followed statements from the office of egypts president abdel fatah alsisi that he was communicating with key international figures – including the palestinian president mahmoud abbas and the un secretary general ban kimoon these interventions come amid accusations from hamas officials that egypt is no longer active in behindthescenes negotiations – claims given greater credibility by the political direction egypt has taken in recent months when fighting broke out in gaza in 2012 egypts then president mohamed morsi – a member of the muslim brotherhood a key ally of hamas – won international acclaim for helping to broker a swift peace deal but since sisi ousted morsi last july relations between egypt and hamas have significantly soured egypt has blocked most of the tunnels connecting egypt and gaza while hamas has been banned inside egypt its actions vilified in egyptian media and some of its members tried in absentia on charges relating to the muslim brotherhood we dont have a relationship with hamas one senior military official told the guardian in april we see them as a terrorist organisation that is allied to the muslim brotherhood but observers said egypt was likely to still be communicating with both hamas and israel even if its relationship with the former is strained according to issandr elamrani a cairobased analyst and project director for the crisis groups north africa project the links between egyptian intelligence and hamas continue even if theyve been lower level in the past months the link was never severed said amrani egypt does not want to empower hamas but that doesnt mean they want the conflict to go on if that was the case two or three days ago it isnt now egyptians ability to affect change is ultimately dependent on the receptiveness of both warring parties amrani said while egypts current influence on hamas is clearly less than morsis now youre dealing with a government in egypt that has made hamas one of its public enemies in terms of both rhetoric and in terms of the tightening of the tunnel trade – so obviously egypt doesnt have hamass best interests at heart but if it can get something out of its involvement it will do so if the main story coming out is that egypt is intervening in the crisis that will change the dominant story about egypt in the international media – which is about human rights abuses a senior regional diplomat said that egypts involvement would ultimately be necessitated by the egyptian publics sympathies for gazans even if the current egyptian admin might not like hamas because the issue is so sensitive and so humanitarian they are not in a position to turn a blind eye to whats going on said the diplomat that wouldnt go well with their own community with hamas widely tarred in the egyptian media since morsis ousting reaction to the latest conflict in gaza has nevertheless appeared more mixed than usual in egypt local reporting suggests that there has not yet been any sizeable progaza rally in cairo while some egyptian columnists have mulled over the difficulty of siding with either hamas or israel but the tide seemed to turn on thursday with egypts main state newspaper giving the issue greater prominence on its front page the head of cairos alazhar mosque – the seat of sunni learning worldwide and an institution largely aligned with the egyptian state – later issued a condemnation of israels actions writing in one private egyptian broadsheet columnist and editor emad eddin hussein said at the end of the day hamas is fighting with our first and last enemy israel we are with hamas as long as the enemy is israel source the guardian thursday 10 july egypt silent as neighbours wage battles again and again over decades egypt has leapt in to play the role of mediator during hostilities between the palestinians and the israelis including the time two years ago when egypts president mohamed morsi helped broker a ceasefire after eight days of bloodshed in the gaza strip but in the latest battle the egyptians appear to be barely lifting a finger leaving the combatants without a gobetween as the palestinian death toll mounts officials with hamas the palestinian islamist movement in gaza said on wednesday they had seen almost no sign of an egyptian effort to defuse the crisis in sharp contrast to previous conflicts under mr morsi and president hosni mubarak making matters worse according to palestinian officials egypt continued to keep its side of the border all but sealed on wednesday barring even humanitarian aid egypts apparent willingness to sit out the crisis reflected shifts in its foreign policy under its new president abdelfattah elsisi who led the military ouster last summer of mr morsi a leader of the muslim brotherhood and a close ally of hamas the brotherhood was outlawed after mr morsis ouster and accused by egyptian officials of terrorism during a crackdown on the governments opponents in various plots against egypt described by the authorities hamas was often cast as the brotherhoods menacing accomplice facing greater isolation and with israel vowing to expand its military offensive hamas leaders were left pining for the nowjailed mr morsi who provided the movement a critical international ally as well as a facesaving exit from the last round of fighting with israel in 2012 it does not feel like egypt is even playing a role in the war said a senior hamas official who insisted on anonymity to talk about diplomatic contacts in other conflicts he said egyptian intelligence officials would communicate intervene and move quickly now hamas had hardly heard a word egyptian officials dismissed the notion that they were sitting the conflict out in a statement the presidents spokesman said he had made extensive contacts with the parties in order to spare the palestinian people the scourge of israeli military operations the contacts though seemed to skirt around hamas there were other signs that the government was trying to ignore the latest fighting which led the news in privately owned egyptian newspapers in the staterun alahram on wednesday it ran smaller below the fold there was an initial attempt to calm things down this has ceased said issandr elamrani the north africa project director at the international crisis group who is based in egypt instead the egyptians appeared to be biding their time and angling for concessions in exchange for any mediating role he said including from the united states which held back some military aid from egypt after the overthrow of mr morsi under mr mubarak egyptian diplomacy was used to put out fires while never bringing palestinians and israelis closer to a final settlement of the conflict egypt had traditionally been at odds with hamas but also very concerned about how escalating violence in the arabisraeli conflict plays out domestically said michael hanna an egypt expert at the century foundation in new york after egypts 2011 revolt that overthrew mr mubarak there were loud demands that the nations foreign policy more accurately reflect popular sympathy for the palestinians and early signs of a change in tone as egypts foreign ministry referred to the blockade of gaza by israel and egypt as shameful after the ceasefire in november 2012 hamas officials spoke of the importance of tranquil relations with israel to allow the brotherhood to put its house in order in egypt but gazans received little relief from the egyptian side mr morsi talked about the necessity of keeping the border open but his government shut the smuggling tunnels to gaza flooding some with sewage the government said it was necessary to stem the flow of arms but it also cut off a lifeline for vital supplies since mr morsis ouster egypts treatment of gaza and hamas has almost exclusively reflected the preoccupations of the security establishment which is battling militants in sinai and views gaza as a burden that israel is trying to shift to egypt mr hanna said on wednesday with the israeli bombing campaign intensifying palestinians on the border tried to get the egyptians to ease the closure according to wael abo mohsen a spokesman for the gaza border crossing authority they have not answered us he said source the new york times wednesday 9 july egypt condemns latest israeli raids on the gaza strip egypts foreign ministry has condemned the raids launched by israeli forces in gaza

to afp spokesman for egypts foreign ministry badr abdelaty stressed the seriousness of the current situation and urged israel to halt all military raids targeting the gaza strip and to stop the collective punishment of the palestinian people in order to not slip into a circle of violence the spokesperson stresses the importance of an israeli initiative for direct communication with the palestinian government to work on solutions that satisfy both parties the statement read abdelaty also said that egypt is making all necessary communications to spare the palestinian people from the woes of israeli attacks adding that egypt holds the israeli side responsible for the lives of palestinian civilians in accordance with the geneva conventions and the rules of international law the latest flareup came a day after israel arrested six jewish extremists in connection with the killing of a palestinian teenager in a suspected revenge crime after last months abduction and murder of three israeli youths in the west bank during the investigation three of the suspects admitted to the murder in which the victim was kidnapped and burned alive an official close to the investigation

capital top us defence officials said last week iraqs security forces were able to defend the capital baghdad but would have difficulty going on the offensive to recapture lost territory mainly because of logistic weaknesses sisi did not name the islamic state in his speech but the mention of countries that are being destroyed and divided in the name of religion was a clear reference to

january 2011 when egyptians revolted against hosni mubarak a barrier of fear was broken im sure president abdul fattah al sisi will destroy any kind of demonstration with an iron fist i think its unlikely anything will succeed right now if you talk to any young people here 90 will say they want to finish their education and then go to the us or europe before the revolution there was a standard of safety or security after the revolution it became outrageous you could be mugged anywhere at any time of day some will say security has improved but not really the education system is broken i just have to complete my studies and do what i can to get out of egypt my brother is going to the us my other brother has graduated from dentistry and will be going to england mona cairo i didnt support the 30 june protests against mohammed morsi but equally i dont support the muslim brotherhood because i feel they were very weak they didnt really have the backing of the powerful institutions in the country like the media i feel that the 30 june protests were a counterrevolution aimed at reversing all the achievements of the 25 january revolution in 2011 i feel helpless when i think of my country i sometimes think that egyptians should just give up their attempts to change the status quo because that will only lead to more death and bloodshed because no one can overpower those who control the country now too many people have died already we dont know the meaning of democracy as a country something in our cultures and traditions makes us unable to cope with it and so we deserve the government that we have ended up with mohannad elsangary cairo last year i was against morsi coming into power because i thought the election was unconstitutional i even joined in with the demonstrations last year however when the military started intervening thats when i thought it was going wrong i saw how things were changing a coup is never a good thing the military had no regard for civilian casualties i felt under morsi it was a dictatorship and i wanted another presidential election but if the people chose him again i would be ok with that its much more dangerous to take part in demonstrations this year last week even though only a few hundred people participated several were attacked by thugs i suspect were hired by the police later on police were arresting anyone they suspected of having taken part in demonstrations even during morsis time there was more tolerance now theres an even worse regime than the muslim brotherhood fady youssef cairo i supported the 30 june protests and still do i think that removing morsi from power was a great step that stopped the political economic and social deterioration of egypt the muslim brotherhood were taking egypt in totally the wrong direction prices were up judicial standards were down and i felt like we were heading for civil war because so many people were so strongly against the brotherhood and what they were doing to the country i think that the new regime sisi will establish a better a future for the country they have a much more comprehensive approach to running the country they have a totally different mentality they have national pride anybody who doesnt want to see more bloodshed in egypt has a place in their egypt not like the brotherhood who cast out anybody who didnt agree with them abdelmeguid saleh cairo last year i went to tahrir square because i did not want morsi to be in power back then he had made several mistakes and he was only concerned about muslim brotherhood neglecting all other parties there was no progress in the country we needed some kind of a plan i wouldnt have minded a plan over 20 years there should at least have been something these days we have sisi and the economy

            "text": "Friday 25 July : Egypt sides with Israel in conflict with Hamas An echo of the anti-Hamas rhetoric coming from Israel during its conflict with Gaza is resonating from what many would consider a surprising corner since fighting erupted July 8: Egypt. A country whose leader just over a year ago had been a close Hamas ally is now one of its principal antagonists. It is stirring up public opinion against the militant group because Hamas is the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt has outlawed. Normally, Egyptians would be decrying Israel for the Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is at more than 750 and rising. But Abou Ahmed Shehab, 60, who sells scarves at a sidewalk stand in central Cairo, was quick to attack Hamas. \"The reason for what's happening to our Palestinian brothers is because of Hamas,\" he says. \"Hamas is an extremist group.\" Last summer, the Egyptian military ousted Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Morsi as president and jailed him. It branded the Islamist group a terrorist organization and threw thousands of its leaders and members in jail. Hundreds were killed as the Islamic movement became the focus of a security crackdown. Since then, a military-backed government that is now led by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who went from military strongman to elected president this past spring, has succeeded in stoking anti-Islamist sentiment among a large swathe of Egypt's public. Both state-run and privately owned media have helped fuel the anti-Hamas attitudes. Hamas has \"terrible policies and the outcomes of those policies are being felt by women and children,\" said taxi driver Medhat Kamel, 40, about civilian deaths in Gaza. \"They rely on violence and don't use dialogue.\" From a political standpoint, Hamas is criticized in Egypt for its \"unwise ways\" of managing the crisis with Israel, said Mustapha Al Sayyid, a political science professor at both Cairo University and the American University in Cairo. Last week, Hamas rejected an Egyptian cease-fire initiative, saying it wasn't consulted and the proposal wouldn't end an Israeli and Egyptian blockade of Hamas-ruled Gaza, which is suffering economically as a result. Egypt's hostility toward Gaza may be one reason Hamas lamented last week that it feels \"alone\" in battling Israel without support from the Arab region. Today's situation is different from 2012, the last conflict between Israel and Hamas. At the time, Morsi brokered a cease-fire that Hamas accepted. Two years later, the Egyptian government, which has accused Hamas of helping militants attack soldiers and police in Egypt, is doing little to help the Palestinians. It's keeping its Rafah border crossing with Gaza closed, even preventing a humanitarian aid convoy from crossing. Khaled Fahmy, chair of the history department at the American University in Cairo, has observed a sea change in public discussion about Hamas recently. \"There has been an alarming outpouring in the past two weeks, not only dumbing down and toning down criticism of Israel, but also — in fact — a very, very sharp increase in vitriolic, racist discourse against Palestinians and Hamas in particular,\" Fahmy said. Last week, an Egyptian writer accused Hamas of militant violence in Egypt, and called on people in Gaza to rebel against the group. \"We are not going to support you going forward or have sympathy for you unless you get rid of the Hamas gang, which puts you in conflict with the world, Israel and the Egyptians,\" Adel Nouman wrote in an opinion piece for daily newspaper El Watan. \"This is the stance of the Egyptian people.\" Some went further, praising Israel's assault on Gaza. \"I'm telling the Israeli army, the Israeli people and the Israeli leaders: You are men,\" media personality and staunch adversary of political Islam, Tawfiq Okasha, declared in a TV broadcast. Despite the Hamas bashing, support for Palestinians and hostility toward Israel have not disappeared from Cairo's streets. Umm Youssef, 33, who was visiting from southern Egypt, said, \"Egyptians and Palestinians are one people, one nation.\"\n\nTuesday 22 July : Gaza Conflict – Egypt may tweak truce deal as Hamas, Israel stick to positions Egypt might be willing to amend its truce initiative to end the fighting in Gaza in order to accommodate the Palestinian militant movement Hamas, which had rejected its terms, three Egyptian officials told Reuters. \"Egypt does not mind adding some of Hamas' conditions provided that all involved parties approve,\" one senior Egyptian official said, without giving details. Among Hamas's conditions are the lifting of the Israeli and Egyptian blockade on Gaza and the release of several hundred Palestinians arrested by Israel last month during its search for three Jewish teenagers abducted in the occupied West Bank. The trio were later found dead in a killing Israel blamed on Hamas. Egyptian officials suspect Hamas rejected the ceasefire plan at the urging of Qatar, a strategic player in reaching an effective deal as host to a large number of exiled Islamists from across the Middle East, including Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal. The possibility of a truce amendment emerges after the top Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip signalled Monday that the Islamic militant group will not agree to an unconditional ceasefire with Israel, while Israel's defence minister pledged to keep fighting \"as long as necessary\" — raising new doubt about the highest-level mediation mission in two weeks. UN chief Ban Ki-moon and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had arrived in Cairo to try to renew ceasefire efforts aimed at ending the Israel-Hamas fighting that has killed at least 530 Palestinians and 20 Israelis and displaced tens of thousands of Gazans in the past two weeks. The U.S. is also sending $47 million in humanitarian aid to the besieged Gaza Strip to help tens of thousands of Palestinians there who have been forced from their homes since war broke out two weeks ago. A State Department breakdown of the aid that was released Monday said nearly a third of the money — $15 million — will go to the United Nations' refugee mission in Gaza.  Despite the new diplomatic push, Israel continued to attack targets in the densely populated coastal strip from the air and from tanks, while Hamas fired more rockets and tried to infiltrate into Israel. Seven Israeli soldiers were killed during clashes with Palestinian militants, the Israeli military said, lifting the army death toll to 25 — more than twice as many as in Israel's last Gaza ground war in 2009. Local media had said there were a number of casualties when Palestinian fighters slipped under the Gaza border earlier in the day via a hidden tunnel. Two civilians have also died in Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli cities.  Earlier on Monday, Israeli tank shells struck a hospital in the Gaza Strip, killing four people and wounding 60, Palestinian officials said. A dozen shells hit the Al Aqsa hospital in the town of Deir el-Balah on Monday, said Palestinian health official Ashraf al-Kidra. He said four people were killed and 60 wounded when the shells landed in the administration building, the intensive care unit and the surgery department. Live video on Hamas's Al Aqsa TV station showed wounded being moved on gurneys into the emergency department. The Israeli military said it was looking into the report. In one of several airstrikes, 25 people were buried under the rubble of a home in the southern town of Khan Younis, including 24 from the same family. Rescue workers pulled the bodies from the wreckage Monday. \"Twenty-five people!\" said family member Sabri Abu Jamea. \"Doesn't this indicate that Israel is ruthless? Are we the liars? The evidence is here in the morgue refrigerators. The evidence is in the refrigerators.\" Another Israeli airstrike hit the home of the Siyam family in southern Gaza, near the town of Rafah, said the Palestinian Center for Human Rights. The strike killed 10 people, including four young children and a nine-month-old baby girl, al-Kidra said. Hamas militants, meanwhile, tried to sneak into Israel through two tunnels, the latest in a series of such attempts. The Israeli military said 10 infiltrators were killed after being detected and targeted by Israeli aircraft. Hamas also fired 50 more rockets at Israel, including two at Tel Aviv, causing no injuries or damage. Since the start of the Israeli operation, Hamas has fired almost 2,000 rockets at Israel. \"The tank fire and the artillery fire is near constant,\" CBC News correspondent Paul Hunter reported today from Erez, Israel, near the northern border with Gaza. Erez is where the tunnels Hamas was using exited into Israel. Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird, speaking by phone from London, told reporters today that Hamas can stop the shelling right now by agreeing to a ceasefire proposal advanced by Egypt and agreed to by Israel. \"I think you can just conclude there's one group that is fully and entirely responsible for this tragedy, and it is Hamas,\" he said. \"They're responsible, and they can stop this at any moment.\" Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon said the Gaza military operation would have no time limit. \"If needed we will recruit more reservists in order to continue the operation as long as necessary until the completion of the task and the return of the quiet in the whole of Israel especially from the threat of the Gaza Strip,\" Yaalon told a parliamentary committee. Israel accepted an Egyptian call for an unconditional ceasefire last week, but resumed its offensive after Hamas rejected the proposal. Ban and Kerry were in Egypt to try to salvage that ceasefire proposal. Hamas, with some support from Qatar and Turkey, wants guarantees that Israel and Egypt will significantly ease a seven-year border blockade of Gaza before halting fire. \"The resistance [Hamas] will not respond to any pressure,\" Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said in a text message, in a reference to the renewed ceasefire efforts. Hamas remains deeply suspicious of the motives of the Egyptian government, which banned the Hamas-friendly Muslim Brotherhood a year ago and tightened restrictions on Gaza — to the point of driving Hamas into its worst financial crisis since its founding in 1987. When asked about such conditions, Ban told reporters Monday in Cairo that \"the best way at this time is to stop the violence and return to dialogue and address the root causes of the problems. I am asking again without any condition, they must stop,\" he said. \"I know that this proposal by Egyptian government ... has been rejected because of certain conditions. If they really want to discuss all these conditions, they will take a very long time.\" Sunday marked the single deadliest day in Gaza since the conflict erupted on July 8, with more than 100 Palestinians killed, according to Palestinian health officials. Most died in the first major ground battle of the conflict, in Gaza City's Shijaiyah neighbourhood, which Israel says is a major source for rocket fire against its civilians. In response to the escalation, the UN Security Council expressed \"serious concern\" about the rising civilian death toll and demanded an immediate end to the fighting. On Sunday afternoon, rescue workers making a last sweep through Shijaiyah had heard the voice of a woman under the rubble, pleading for help. The team left because it deemed the situation too dangerous, but returned later Sunday with a bulldozer to rescue the three people trapped underneath. Seven-year-old Bissam Dhaher, her face bruised and bandaged, was recovering Monday at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital. Relatives watched over her as the girl slept. Her uncle remained hospitalized, while an aunt — the one who had called out for help — was released, relatives said. On Sunday evening, Hamas spokesman Mushir al-Masri in Gaza claimed his group had captured an Israeli soldier. An announcement on Gaza TV of the soldier's capture set off celebration in the streets of West Bank. But there was no official confirmation or denial of the claim in Israel. For Israelis, a captured soldier would be a nightmare scenario. Hamas-allied militants seized an Israeli soldier in a cross-border raid in 2006 and held him captive in Gaza until Israel traded more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, some of whom were involved in grisly killings, for his return in 2011.\n\nMonday 21 July : Split between Egypt and Hamas plagues efforts to bring cease-fire to Gaza Even as the death toll mounts in the Gaza Strip, attempts to broker a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel have so far run aground — in part because they have become mired in the deep divisions between Mideast countries. At the center of the problems is the bitter enmity between Egypt and its Gulf allies like Saudi Arabia on one side and Gaza's Hamas rulers and its allies, Turkey and Qatar, on the other. An Egyptian cease-fire proposal quickly fell apart the past week when Israel accepted it but Hamas rejected it. Hamas demanded greater guarantees for the lifting of the blockade of Gaza, enforced by Israel and Egypt. The Egyptian proposal called for both sides to halt hostilities unconditionally — dangling only a promise of further talks that could address the closure. Qatar-based Hamas spokesman Hossam Badran described Cairo's cease-fire proposal as \"all but dead,\" calling it a \"surrender\" to Israel. He and other Hamas officials said they were instead turning to Qatar, which they said had an initiative that would address their demands, including release of prisoners and giving unfettered access to the densely populated strip. That quickly sparked accusations by Egypt that Hamas' allies were undermining it. \"The Hamas-Qatar-Turkey axis is trying to abort Egypt's role, which is the region bulwark in the face of a plot aimed at fragmenting the region into rival mini-states,\" Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shukri told reporters Thursday night, just before Israel announced the start of its ground assault into Gaza. Shukri said Egypt is in a \"very tense and difficult\" relationship with Hamas, where reaching common ground is nearly \"impossible.\" On Saturday, Shukri said he knows of no other initiative and that \"the Egyptian initiative remains the initiative on the table\" with international support.Speaking next to visiting French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, Shukri said there was no intention to amend the proposal, which he said meets the demands of both sides. The tensions are rooted in the turmoil in Egypt over the past year. Hamas spawned off the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt's government has branded a terrorist organization since the military's ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi last summer. Egyptian authorities have been cracking down hard on Morsi's Brotherhood and accuse Hamas of helping Islamic militants waging a campaign of violence in Egypt, a claim the group denies. Egypt also has tightened the closure on Gaza by destroying smuggling tunnels under the border that were largely propping up the strip's economy. That has thrown Hamas into a financial crisis. Turkey and Qatar were also close allies of Morsi and the Brotherhood — and the result has been deep tensions between them and the government of Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, the former army chief that ousted Morsi. The cease-fire plan put forth by Egypt now is virtually identical to one presented by Morsi during the last round of Gaza fighting. At the time, both sides accepted the accord, and Morsi was lauded for his mediation. Now, however, there is not only deep mistrust in the way, but also increased Hamas expectations for an end to the stifling blockade. Badran told The Associated Press that Hamas wants the permanent opening of the Rafah crossing with Egypt, an arrangement to allow Gazans to pray in Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and the release of political prisoners held by Israel. Hamas and its allies Qatar and Turkey also are pressing for the opening of an airport and seaport in Gaza under international administration. \"We have to impose conditions and guarantees to prevent the recurring of this assault and lift this inhumane and illogical blockade on Gaza,\" Qatari Foreign Minister Khalid al-Attiya said in a speech last week. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has said the blockade must be lifted. \"If a tunnel is closed, an airport has to be opened. There has to be a breathing space. The situation now is beyond a ghetto,\" he said in an interview Thursday with Turkey's NTV television. However, Egypt — as well as Hamas' rival Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas — is wary of any moves that would give Hamas breathing room and strengthen its hold on Gaza. \"There is no way Egypt is going to let the crossing open for Hamas to come and go without control,\" an Egyptian foreign ministry official said. He said Egypt could agree to international observers — or forces from Abbas' Palestinian Authority — controlling the crossing, as long as they are on the Gaza side. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists. Sameh Seif al-Yazel, a security expert and one-time member of el-Sissi's presidential campaign, said Egypt would accept arrangements giving free movement in and out of Gaza as long as they are endorsed by the Palestinian Authority. \"Egypt is siding with the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people, not Hamas,\" he said. Abbas has backed the Egyptian proposal, saying it is identical to the 2012 cease-fire brokered by Morsi. After visiting Cairo, Abbas left to Turkey, where he is expected to meet with Hamas' top leader, Khaled Mashaal, before heading to Qatar and other Gulf countries in an attempt to bridge the gaps. Turkey meanwhile has denied undermining Egypt's efforts. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan angrily denounced el-Sissi, saying, he \"is an oppressor, a coup leader. He is the person who has been blocking Hamas' routes.\" Soon after Morsi's ouster, Egypt and Turkey recalled their ambassadors. Egypt also shut down Qatar-owned satellite news network Al-Jazeera's bureau there, accusing it of being a mouthpiece for the Brotherhood. Throughout the current Gaza crisis, Egypt's media — which is overwhelmingly supportive of el-Sissi — has been sharply critical of Hamas. TV stations have accused Hamas of wasting Palestinian blood and \"commercializing\" the Palestinian cause. The editor in chief of the state-owned Al-Ahram on Saturday accused Hamas and its allies of seeking to \"stir public opinion\" against el-Sissi and his government by prolonging the conflict with Israel. In one recent program, fiercely pro-military television presenter Tawfiq Okasha described Hamas and those who show any sympathy for it as \"dogs\" and waved his shoes in a show of contempt for \"those who don't appreciate Egypt's weight.\"\n\nThursday 17 July : Can Egypt deliver a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas? Critics say Egypt was slow to respond to the current crisis, and its initial efforts have faltered. Add to that the open mistrust being demonstrated by the key Palestinian faction - Hamas - and it doesn't look like a winning formula. But the warfare looks certain to give way to a ceasefire. And Cairo is still the most likely broker. \"I don't see anyone else who can play that role,\" said the Arab League Secretary General, Nabil al-Arabi, a former foreign minister of Egypt. \"If anyone else wants to help let him try.\" During the last major eruption of violence between Israel and the Hamas - in November 2012 - Egypt played its traditional role as mediator.At that time it was well placed to broker a truce.The President, Mohammed Morsi, was an Islamist with fraternal ties to Hamas - an offshoot of his Muslim Brotherhood.Now Mr Morsi is in jail, and the new Egyptian authorities regard Hamas as a terrorist group. That is certainly a complication. \"It's very difficult for Egypt to engage with Hamas as it used to,\" says H A Hellyer, of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). \"Egypt is engaged in what it considers to be a war on terror, which involves Hamas, as part of the Muslim Brotherhood. So the population of Gaza is collateral damage in two wars on terror - Israel's and Egypt's.\" When news of Egypt's ceasefire proposal emerged on Monday night it came as a surprise to many - apparently including the leadership of Hamas. These days Egypt has better relations with Israel than with the Islamists who run Gaza. Some analysts believe that - initially at least - Cairo was happy to see Hamas under attack. There is little doubt that Egypt's security establishment would like to see Hamas crushed, as it has crushed the Brotherhood. But Egypt cannot afford to wash its hands of Hamas. If someone else manages to do a deal - without Egypt - that would dent the prestige of the new Egyptian President, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. Hamas is unlikely to sign up to anything without the endorsement of its regional ally, Qatar. But Egypt will not include the Qataris because of their support for the Brotherhood.  The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is expected to act as a go-between. He is due in Cairo on Friday. One of the difficulties is securing a truce is that the Hamas leadership is fractured, physically and politically. Some senior figures are in hiding and others are in exile. \"There are differences within Hamas,\" said one Egyptian official. \"We don't think [exiled political leader] Khaled Meshaal can control the leadership in Gaza or the military wing. We can't have a conversation with every Jack, Joe and Harry.\" He believes the deal will be done \"when Israel has finished what it wants to finish, and when Hamas has come to the point of collapse\". That may not take too long. The Arab league's secretary general believes that Hamas will agree to the Egyptian proposal - with some crucial extras. One of their key demands is the opening of Gaza's borders, ending blockades by both Israel and Egypt. Even if a ceasefire is hammered out, Mr Arabi believes it will not last unless there is political progress towards an independent Palestinian state. \"Even if this truce holds, in a couple of months we will find something else. The message for the outside world is that what we need now is an end to [Israel's] occupation, to have the two state solution.\" After a shaky start it is clear that diplomatic efforts are gaining momentum. The Palestinian Authority President, Mahmoud Abbas is already in Cairo, along with delegations from Qatar and Israel. Israeli air strikes have killed more than 200 Palestinians in the past 10 days - more than 80% of them civilians, according to the United Nations. But Israel moved adroitly to agree to the ceasefire soon after it was proposed, in contrast to Hamas. Next time a deal is put forward, Hamas may have little real choice but to sign up - or bear the blame for further bloodshed alone.\n\nTuesday 15 July : Israel has accepted an Egyptian truce proposal for the conflict with Gaza. Hamas, which controls Gaza, is still discussing the plan, but its armed wing has rejected it as a \"surrender\". Under the terms, the ceasefire should begin immediately, followed by a series of meetings in Cairo with high-level delegations from both sides. Palestinian officials say at least 192 people have been killed by Israeli air strikes launched eight days ago to stop militants firing rockets into Israel.There have been no Israeli air strikes into Gaza since the 09:00 ( 06:00 GMT) truce, but Israel says more than 20 rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel after the deadline. If Hamas continues to reject the deal, then the Israelis will feel they emerge from the breakdown holding the diplomatic high ground. No-one can be sure what's happening behind the scenes between Hamas and Egypt. Hamas has both political and military wings - and some leaders who are not in Gaza. And communications are difficult with many senior officials in hiding during the Israeli air raids. So establishing the group's definitive answer may take a little time, although we're clear on the views of military leaders inside the enclave that the Egyptian proposal is \"a surrender\". The Palestinian militant group needs some sort of political win from this confrontation after all the suffering and destruction its people have gone through - the likeliest area of compromise would be some sort of easing of the tight economic restrictions on Gaza for which Israel and Egypt are jointly responsible. But there's no guarantee of success for now. Israel's security cabinet, convened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, approved the truce on Tuesday morning, minutes before the proposed time for it to come into effect. \"We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarisation of the [Gaza] Strip - from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels - through diplomatic means,\" Mr Netanyahu told reporters. But he added: \"If Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet.\" Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the IDF, Israel's military, said: \"In accordance with the government directives, the IDF now holds fire. We remain alert and preserve high preparedness levels, both defensive and offensive.\" The BBC's Kevin Connolly says that Israel's rapid acceptance of the Egyptian ceasefire proposal is striking, and represents a smart tactical move. If the deal holds then Israel will be happy with the outcome, our correspondent says - because it has damaged stockpiles of weapons that Hamas will find difficult to replenish, and it will have quiet on its border with Gaza. For now, Hamas sources are saying its attacks will \"increase in ferocity and intensity\" unless Israel releases prisoners and co-operates with Egypt to lift economic restrictions on Gaza. That is not encouraging but does not mean that a deal will not ultimately be done - just that it will not be easy, our correspondent says. Meanwhile the casualty figures continue to mount. Three people were killed in Khan Younis, south of Gaza, on Tuesday morning, shortly before Israel accepted the proposed truce. Of the 192 now reported dead by the Palestinian health authority, the UN estimates that over three-quarters were civilians. An estimated 1,400 Palestinians have been injured. Israel disputes the Palestinian casualty figures, saying they were based on Hamas sources and were not objective. At least four Israelis have been seriously injured since the violence flared, but no-one has been killed. Israeli sources said at least three rockets landed in and around the southern Israeli city of Eilat overnight. Reports suggest they may have been fired from the Sinai peninsula in Egypt rather than from Gaza.\n\nA year ago, many hailed him as their saviour for overthrowing President Mohammed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood. They elected him president in May, with a 97% majority of votes cast. Now Egyptians are trying to find out how retired field marshal-turned-President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi plans to tackle Egypt's problems. For a man who has effectively been in power for a year, President Sisi has revealed little about himself and above all about his vision for Egypt. He was not elected on the basis of his programme. One aide says he did not present one until the very end of the campaign in order to avoid unnecessary debate and controversy. Nor was he elected on the basis of his charisma. A military man all his life, he comes across as serious and dignified, but not inspiring. He is not an eloquent public speaker, although people who meet him find him sincere and convincing. He was elected above all for having overthrown President Morsi. A year later, most Egyptians are still happy about the demise of Mr Morsi, but somewhat puzzled about Mr Sisi. During a recent trip, the questions I asked Egyptian politicians, analysts, and businessmen about President Sisi's policies elicited remarkably numerous answers along the lines of \"I really do not know\", including from people who repeatedly participated in meetings with him. The first few weeks of Mr Sisi's presidency have begun to provide glimpses into his personality, or at least the public persona he has chosen.They have also given some indication about his political views, but have revealed almost nothing about how he intends to tackle urgent economic problems. Mr Sisi wants to be seen as a serious, honest, hard-working, and pious president. During the election campaign, he repeatedly warned Egyptians of the hard work ahead, and he is continuing to do so now. President Sisi tells Egyptians to cycle and walk more to save the country money. He has told his ministers they must set an example by being in the office by 07:00. He emphasises the contribution individuals can make towards solving Egypt's problems. If people rode their bicycles or walked to work, he says, they would save the country millions in oil imports. His actions leave no doubt he prefers order and discipline over individual choice. He has announced that he is donating half his salary and half his personal assets to support the Egyptian economy - a move that will force senior officials and prominent businessmen to do the same. In fact, the defence minister has already announced the military will donate $140m (£82m). He has ordered the ministry of finance to enforce rules on maximum wages. He talks about the importance of religion and leaves no room for doubt about his own commitment to Islam: his forehead bears the mark that develops when a person prays regularly. He has stressed that Egypt is committed to \"correcting the religious discourse\" and freeing it from extremism. New initiatives and laws (many announced by the outgoing interim President Adly Mansour after the election but before the inauguration of Mr Sisi) convey the same messages about rectitude and morality. Egypt's ministry of youth and sports has declared it will combat atheism among young people. The ministry of interior has banned religious slogans on vehicles. The interior minister also says he'll form a new department that will handle sexual assault cases, and Mr Sisi has already demonstrated his personal interest in the issue, by being photographed on a hospital visit to a woman receiving treatment after an assault in Cairo's Tahrir Square during his inauguration celebrations. On the political front, however, the message from the president and his government is one of strict top-down control over all aspects of life. During the election campaign, Mr Sisi said democracy in Egypt would be impossible for at least 25 years. His actions, too, leave no doubt that he prefers order and discipline over individual choice. The laws governing the forthcoming parliamentary elections guarantee a weak parliament because they favour individual candidates over political parties. With about 25% of ordinary Egyptians living below the poverty line and a similar percentage hovering just above it, he must act soon. Mr Sisi has established a Supreme Council for Legislative Reform by decree, which will be able to draft new laws and leave the parliament to do the rubber-stamping. He has also tightened control over religion and education. Only preachers licensed by al-Azhar, one of the main centres of Sunni Muslim learning, will be allowed to deliver sermons, and Mr Sisi will personally appoint university presidents and deans. Repression of the Muslim Brotherhood continues, with over a thousand members sentenced to death by the courts in summary trials. Young people who defy the anti-protest law brought in last December have been given tough sentences. So have al-Jazeera journalists accused of fabricating stories. Even street vendors and people who litter have been targeted, in an effort to clean up the cities. On the most important challenge he faces - reviving the economy - President Sisi has sent out very few and contradictory signals, and, with about 25% of ordinary Egyptians living below the poverty line and a similar percentage hovering just above it, he must act soon. After his election win, President Sisi tells Egyptians it is now \"time to work\" to rebuild the economy. The business community is waiting for clear signals about his intentions. Even Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, all countries which have poured billions into the Egyptian economy since President Morsi's overthrow, are hinting they will not continue their support indefinitely, particularly if Egypt does not adopt clear policies and major reforms. Mr Sisi has done neither. His approach is confusing: he states the private sector has a role to play, if not a duty to invest. But he remains committed to the state sector and has put the military in charge of managing the massive housing projects financed by the United Arab Emirates. Above all, the government cannot reach a decision on the urgently needed reform of food and energy subsidies, which occupy a third of the budget. Plans are periodically announced but never implemented, in case they lead to unrest. Egypt's economic growth forecast is far too low to alleviate poverty for its rapidly growing population The latest announcement, on 30 June, that the government will slash energy subsidies by the equivalent of $5.6bn (£3.3 bn) was typically vague: savings will be achieved through \"redistribution and restructuring,\" he has said, but without a timetable. Egyptians still have a lot to discover about their new president. Marina Ottaway is a Senior Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center and a long-time analyst of political transformations in Africa, the Balkans, and the Middle East.\n\nEgypt says it has opened its border crossing with Gaza to allow the most critical casualties of Israeli airstrikes access to Egyptian medical care, following accusations that it has abandoned its usual role of mediating between the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships. The opening of the border accompanied statements by Egyptian officials that stressed Egypt's active role in bringing the latest Gaza conflict, which Palestinians say has killed over 70 Gazans, to an end. The spokesman for Egypt's foreign ministry, Badr Abdelatty, told the Guardian: \"We have extensive and full contact with all parties concerned, either directly or internationally. Our main objective is to stop Israeli aggression. We are in full contact and pushing very hard to provide all humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians in Gaza.\" Abdelatty's comments followed statements from the office of Egypt's president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, that he was communicating with key international figures – including the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. These interventions come amid accusations from Hamas officials that Egypt is no longer active in behind-the-scenes negotiations – claims given greater credibility by the political direction Egypt has taken in recent months. When fighting broke out in Gaza in 2012, Egypt's then president, Mohamed Morsi – a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a key ally of Hamas – won international acclaim for helping to broker a swift peace deal. But since Sisi ousted Morsi last July, relations between Egypt and Hamashave significantly soured. Egypt has blocked most of the tunnels connecting Egypt and Gaza, while Hamas has been banned inside Egypt, its actions vilified in Egyptian media, and some of its members tried in absentia on charges relating to the Muslim Brotherhood. \"We don't have a relationship with Hamas,\" one senior military official told the Guardian in April. \"We see them as a terrorist organisation that is allied to the Muslim Brotherhood.\" But observers said Egypt was likely to still be communicating with both Hamas and Israel, even if its relationship with the former is strained. According to Issandr el-Amrani, a Cairo-based analyst, and project director for the Crisis Group's North Africa project, the links between Egyptian intelligence and Hamas continue. \"Even if they've been lower level in the past months, the link was never severed,\" said Amrani. \"Egypt does not want to empower Hamas but that doesn't mean they want the conflict to go on … If that was the case two or three days ago, it isn't now.\" Egyptians' ability to affect change is ultimately dependent on the receptiveness of both warring parties, Amrani said, while Egypt's current influence on Hamas is clearly less than Morsi's. \"Now you're dealing with a government [in Egypt] that has made Hamas one of its public enemies in terms of both rhetoric and in terms of the tightening of the tunnel trade – so obviously Egypt doesn't have Hamas's best interests at heart. But if it can get something out of its involvement, it will do so. If the main story coming out is that Egypt is intervening in the crisis, that will change the dominant story about Egypt in the international media – which is about human rights abuses.\" A senior regional diplomat said that Egypt's involvement would ultimately be necessitated by the Egyptian public's sympathies for Gazans. \"Even if the current Egyptian admin might not like Hamas, because the issue is so sensitive and so humanitarian they are not in a position to turn a blind eye to what's going on,\" said the diplomat. \"That wouldn't go well with their own community.\" With Hamas widely tarred in the Egyptian media since Morsi's ousting, reaction to the latest conflict in Gaza has nevertheless appeared more mixed than usual in Egypt. Local reporting suggests that there has not yet been any sizeable pro-Gaza rally in Cairo, while some Egyptian columnists have mulled over the difficulty of siding with either Hamas or Israel. But the tide seemed to turn on Thursday, with Egypt's main state newspaper giving the issue greater prominence on its front page. The head of Cairo's al-Azhar mosque – the seat of Sunni learning worldwide, and an institution largely aligned with the Egyptian state – later issued a condemnation of Israel's actions. Writing in one private Egyptian broadsheet, columnist and editor Emad Eddin Hussein said: \"At the end of the day, Hamas is fighting with our first and last enemy: Israel … We are with Hamas as long as the enemy is Israel.\"\n\nAgain and again over decades, Egypt has leapt in to play the role of mediator during hostilities between the Palestinians and the Israelis, including the time two years ago when Egypt’s president, Mohamed Morsi, helped broker a cease-fire after eight days of bloodshed in the Gaza Strip. But in the latest battle, the Egyptians appear to be barely lifting a finger, leaving the combatants without a go-between as the Palestinian death toll mounts. Officials with Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement in Gaza, said on Wednesday they had seen almost no sign of an Egyptian effort to defuse the crisis, in sharp contrast to previous conflicts under Mr. Morsi and President Hosni Mubarak. Making matters worse, according to Palestinian officials, Egypt continued to keep its side of the border all but sealed on Wednesday, barring even humanitarian aid. Egypt’s apparent willingness to sit out the crisis reflected shifts in its foreign policy under its new president, Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi, who led the military ouster last summer of Mr. Morsi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and a close ally of Hamas. The Brotherhood was outlawed after Mr. Morsi’s ouster, and accused by Egyptian officials of terrorism during a crackdown on the government’s opponents. In various plots against Egypt described by the authorities, Hamas was often cast as the Brotherhood’s menacing accomplice. Facing greater isolation, and with Israel vowing to expand its military offensive, Hamas leaders were left pining for the now-jailed Mr. Morsi, who provided the movement a critical international ally as well as a face-saving exit from the last round of fighting with Israel, in 2012. “It does not feel like Egypt is even playing a role in the war,” said a senior Hamas official, who insisted on anonymity to talk about diplomatic contacts. In other conflicts, he said, Egyptian intelligence officials would “communicate, intervene and move quickly.” Now, Hamas had hardly heard a word. Egyptian officials dismissed the notion that they were sitting the conflict out. In a statement, the president’s spokesman said he had made “extensive contacts” with the parties in order “to spare the Palestinian people the scourge of Israeli military operations.” The contacts, though, seemed to skirt around Hamas. There were other signs that the government was trying to ignore the latest fighting, which led the news in privately owned Egyptian newspapers. In the state-run Al-Ahram on Wednesday, it ran smaller, below the fold. “There was an initial attempt to calm things down. This has ceased,” saidIssandr el-Amrani, the North Africa project director at the International Crisis Group, who is based in Egypt. Instead, the Egyptians appeared to be biding their time and angling for concessions in exchange for any mediating role, he said, including from the United States, which held back some military aid from Egypt after the overthrow of Mr. Morsi. Under Mr. Mubarak, Egyptian diplomacy was used to put out fires while never bringing Palestinians and Israelis closer to a final settlement of the conflict. Egypt had “traditionally been at odds with Hamas, but also very concerned about how escalating violence in the Arab-Israeli conflict plays out domestically,” said Michael Hanna, an Egypt expert at the Century Foundation in New York. After Egypt’s 2011 revolt that overthrew Mr. Mubarak, there were loud demands that the nation’s foreign policy more accurately reflect popular sympathy for the Palestinians, and early signs of a change in tone, as Egypt’s Foreign Ministry referred to the blockade of Gaza by Israel and Egypt as “shameful.” After the cease-fire in November 2012, Hamas officials spoke of the importance of tranquil relations with Israel, to allow the Brotherhood to put its house in order in Egypt. But Gazans received little relief from the Egyptian side. Mr. Morsi talked about the necessity of keeping the border open, but his government shut the smuggling tunnels to Gaza, flooding some with sewage. The government said it was necessary to stem the flow of arms, but it also cut off a lifeline for vital supplies. Since Mr. Morsi’s ouster, Egypt’s treatment of Gaza and Hamas has almost exclusively reflected the preoccupations of the security establishment, which is battling militants in Sinai and views Gaza as a burden that Israel is trying to shift to Egypt, Mr. Hanna said. On Wednesday, with the Israeli bombing campaign intensifying, Palestinians on the border tried to get the Egyptians to ease the closure, according to Wael Abo Mohsen, a spokesman for the Gaza Border Crossing Authority. “They have not answered us,” he said.\n\nMonday 7 July : Egypt’s president says al-Jazeera journalist’s should never have been tried Egypt's president has acknowledged for the first time that the heavy sentences handed down to three al-Jazeera journalists had a \"very negative\" impact on his country's reputation, saying he wished they had never been put on trial. The comments by Abdel Fatah al-Sisi to Egyptian media editors, published late on Sunday, are the first public recognition by Egyptian officials that the case has damaged the country's international relations. The sentencing of the Australian reporter Peter Greste, Egyptian-Canadian acting bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian producer Baher Mohamed on 23 June, after a five-month trial described as a \"sham\" by rights groups, caused an international outcry. \"The verdict issued against a number of journalists had very negative consequences, and we had nothing to do with it,\" Sisi said, suggesting it had no political element. \"I wished they were deported immediately after their arrest instead of being put on trial.\" His comments were published in the online version of Al-Masry Al-Youm daily. Greste's brother Andrew, who has just returned from Egypt, welcomed Sisi's comments as ‘heartening’. \"I'm sure images of Peter in the cage in the court are not images Egypt really want distributed around the world,\" he told reporters in Brisbane. \"And the publicity they're getting out of this I'm sure is not the publicity any country would want.\" He said he was not sure if the president's comments would lead to a resolution, with Sisi previously saying he would not interfere in the judicial process. \"I'd like to think that there's things happening at all levels ... and everyone can talk about it and seek an amicable solution,\" Andrew Greste said. The journalists were arrested on 29 December and accused of aiding the Brotherhood by providing it with a media platform and equipment. The Egyptians were also accused of belonging to the Brotherhood, the group the government declared a terrorist organisation. Greste and Fahmy each received seven-year sentences, while Mohammed got 10 years. Three other foreign journalists were sentenced to 10 years in absentia. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, called the sentences \"chilling and draconian\", and urged Egyptian authorities to address international concerns. A day after the sentences and following an outpouring of international condemnation, Sisi appeared to resist the pressure, saying in televised comments he would not interfere in court rulings. The sentences can be appealed, a process that can take months. Egypt's constitution allows the president to issue a pardon, but experts argue the appeals process must be exhausted first. In his remarks published on Sunday, he said the case represented one foreign policy challenge facing Egypt, but stopped short of saying whether he would listen to pleas for clemency. He seemed to be refuting claims that the case was politically motivated, and reflected tension between Egypt and Qatar, the Gulf state that owns the television network. Qatar supported the ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi, and his Muslim Brotherhood group. After Morsi's overthrow last year, many of the group's leaders moved to Qatar to avoid an intense government crackdown that landed thousands in jail.\n\nThursday 3 July : Egypt : How much has changed in a year? Egypt's first democratically elected President Mohammed Morsi was deposed by the military one year ago, on 3 July 2013. The removal of the Islamist leader followed mass protests against his rule, but turmoil and bloodshed has continued. Here, Egyptians give their views on whether the country has changed for the better or worse over the past 12 months. Overall things might have gotten worse. It's a police state once again. We're back to the army. There are lots of blackouts. Many of the problems have not been solved. On 25 January 2011 [when Egyptians revolted against Hosni Mubarak] a barrier of fear was broken. I'm sure [President Abdul Fattah al-] Sisi will destroy any kind of demonstration with an iron fist. I think it's unlikely anything will succeed right now. If you talk to any young people here, 90% will say they want to finish their education and then go to the US or Europe. Before the revolution there was a standard of safety or security. After the revolution it became outrageous. You could be mugged anywhere at any time of day. Some will say security has improved, but not really. The education system is broken. I just have to complete my studies and do what I can to get out of Egypt. My brother is going to the US. My other brother has graduated from dentistry, and will be going to England. I didn't support the 30 June protests [against Mohammed Morsi] but equally I don't support the Muslim Brotherhood because I feel they were very weak. They didn't really have the backing of the powerful institutions in the country, like the media. I feel that the 30 June protests were a counter-revolution aimed at reversing all the achievements of the 25 January revolution in 2011. I feel helpless when I think of my country. I sometimes think that Egyptians should just give up their attempts to change the status quo because that will only lead to more death and bloodshed because no one can overpower those who control the country now. Too many people have died already. We don't know the meaning of democracy, as a country; something in our cultures and traditions makes us unable to cope with it, and so we deserve the government that we have ended up with. Last year I was against Morsi coming into power because I thought the election was unconstitutional. I even joined in with the demonstrations last year. However, when the military started intervening, that's when I thought it was going wrong. I saw how things were changing - a coup is never a good thing. The military had no regard for civilian casualties. I felt under Morsi it was a dictatorship and I wanted another presidential election but if the people chose him again I would be ok with that. It's much more dangerous to take part in demonstrations this year. Last week, even though only a few hundred people participated, several were attacked by thugs I suspect were hired by the police. Later on police were arresting anyone they suspected of having taken part in demonstrations. Even during Morsi's time there was more tolerance. Now, there's an even worse regime than the Muslim Brotherhood. I supported the 30 June protests and still do. I think that removing Morsi from power was a great step that stopped the political, economic and social deterioration of Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhood were taking Egypt in totally the wrong direction, prices were up, judicial standards were down and I felt like we were heading for civil war because so many people were so strongly against the Brotherhood and what they were doing to the country. I think that the new regime (Sisi) will establish a better a future for the country. They have a much more comprehensive approach to running the country. They have a totally different mentality, they have national pride, anybody who doesn't want to see more bloodshed in Egypt has a place in their Egypt, not like The Brotherhood who cast out anybody who didn't agree with them. Last year I went to Tahrir Square because I did not want Morsi to be in power. Back then, he had made several mistakes and he was only concerned about Muslim Brotherhood, neglecting all other parties. There was no progress in the country. We needed some kind of a plan. I wouldn't have minded a plan over 20 years - there should at least have been something. These days we have Sisi and the economy is getting better. He says we have tough times ahead, but let's just do it. I don't mind the military being in place. It is safer now. Apart from some of the bombings I feel much safer than last year. Traffic is improving. The streets are getting fixed up. There have been improvements over the last three months.",

            "text": "Israel (BBN)-Israel has resumed its air strikes on Hamas-controlled Gaza, after Israel's brief truce was met with continuing rocket fire. Israel had earlier accepted an Egyptian ceasefire proposal and halted operations on Tuesday morning, reports BBC. But the armed wing of Hamas rejected the initiative as a \"surrender\". Palestinian officials say at least 192 people have been killed by Israeli air strikes launched eight days ago to stop militants firing rockets into Israel. At least four Israelis have been seriously injured since the violence flared, but none have been killed. The Israel Defense Forces said about 50 rockets had been fired into Israel during the six hours it had halted air strikes on Tuesday. It took six hours for the first attempt to broker a deal between Israel and Hamas to founder. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu had warned that if the rocket fire continued, Israel would hit back hard - and now it has. In the search for a ceasefire, this is clearly a setback although not necessarily a terminal blow. Hamas wants some concessions - like the lifting of the tight restrictions Israel and Egypt impose on Gaza's border - in advance of any deal. Egypt won't give up on its diplomatic efforts after a single setback but the resumption of hostilities means the question of whether Israel will eventually order ground operations is back on the agenda. A number of new targets in Gaza have now been hit by Israeli air strikes. Under the terms of the Egyptian initiative, the ceasefire should have been followed by a series of meetings in Cairo with high-level delegations from the two sides. There has been no definitive response to the initiative from Hamas. PM Benjamin Netanyahu (speaking before operations resumed): \"Our goal remains putting an end to rocket fire from Gaza\" Senior Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan told the BBC it had only heard about the truce initiative through the media and that a ceasefire could not be put in place without the details of any agreement being known. The armed wing of Hamas, the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades, dismissed the initiative, saying its battle with Israel would \"increase in ferocity and intensity\". US Secretary of State John Kerry said he could not \"condemn strongly enough\" Hamas' actions in continuing to fire rockets. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told the BBC: \"Hamas had seven hours to get their act together and they have rejected this ceasefire proposal... it's rejected it both in word and in deed.\" Israel's security cabinet, convened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, had approved the truce on Tuesday morning, minutes before the proposed time for it to come into effect - at 09:00 (06:00 GMT). \"We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarisation of the [Gaza] Strip - from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels - through diplomatic means,\" Netanyahu had said. But he had then added: \"If Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet.\" The BBC's Kevin Connolly said that Israel's rapid acceptance of the Egyptian ceasefire proposal was a smart tactical move. If the deal had held, Israel would have been happy with the outcome, he says, because it has damaged stockpiles of weapons that Hamas will find difficult to replenish. Read more... Dhaka, Bangladesh (BBN)-Bangladesh government is planning to impose a temporary ban on rice bran exports to India to encourage local edible oil production in the country. Sources at the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) told local media that they would impose the ban after getting a clarity over the domestic production of rice bran, its exports as well as imports of non-oily rice bran from India annually, reports oryza.com. Bangladesh imports non-oil rice bran from India in exchange for rice bran exports. It also imports huge quantities of edible rice bran oil for local consumption. He noted that the EPB was gathering information from a range of government agencies, including the Food Department, regarding the number of rice bran oil producing factories in the country, their capacity and the quantity of rice bran needed for adequate rice bran oil production in the country. Local sources say Bangladesh can produce sufficient quantity of rice bran oil both for local consumption as well as for exports. Also demand for rice bran oil has been increasing in Bangladesh given its health benefits over sunflower oil and soybean oil.

Dhaka, Bangladesh (BBN)-Russia's state-owned Gazprom is interested in setting up a joint venture with Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company, Bapex, to jointly carry out oil and gas exploration in either of the countries or others, Petrobangla Chairman Hussain Monsur said Tuesday. Gazprom, which is increasingly more focused on strengthening relations with Asia, currently operates in Bangladesh on a contract basis, as a drilling contractor, reports platts.com. Gazprom International CEO Valeriy Gulev late last week expressed the company's interest during a meeting in Dhaka between Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and a Gazprom delegation. The proposed JV between Gazprom and Bangladesh's sole oil and gas exploration company could be used to identify and implement new projects in Bangladesh, Russia or any third countries, the chairman of Bangladesh Oil, Gas & Mineral Corporation, or Petrobangla, said. The Russian side has expressed its strong interest in this initiative and its readiness to carry out comprehensive analysis and the required consultations at the earliest opportunity, he added. A timeline for setting up the proposed JV was not disclosed. In addition to carrying out joint exploration onshore and offshore Bangladesh, Gulev also proposed joint exploration for hydrocarbons in Myanmar under the proposed JV, the Bangladesh prime minister's press secretary AKM Shamim Chowdhury said. Officials said the Gazprom CEO's visit to Bangladesh follows a series of meetings between representatives of both countries on gas exploration. Bangladesh in September last year sought a $2 billion loan from Russia, at an interest rate of less than 2 percent, to fund development of its onshore gas fields. It has not received the loan as yet. The funds were for drilling 41 wells -- comprising 13 development, 8 appraisal, 13 workover and 7 exploratory wells -- in the Titas, Bankhrabad, Kamta, Bhola, Horipur, Koilashtila, Biani Bazar, Chittagong and Rashidpur gas fields. Bangladesh also wanted to build 12 gas processing plants at the fields operated by state-owned Bangladesh Gas Fields Company. In addition, it was also planning to carry out 2,570 km of 2-D and 3-D seismic surveys in several onshore areas and build 511 km (317 miles) of natural gas pipelines to link fields to domestic markets. It expects these developments, if completed, to increase natural gas output by 1.06 Bcf/d. In September last year, Gazprom had expressed interest in drilling four new wells -- two in the Shahbazpur gas field and one each in the Haripur and Jaldi gas fields, Monsur said. It was also interested in building a natural gas pipeline from Shahbazpur to Khulna in the south, where there is currently no gas available, he added. There seems to be no progress in most of these plans as yet. Gazprom is currently carrying out a 10-well drilling program costing around $193.5 million in state-run gas fields owned by three gas subsidiaries of Petrobangla. Gazprom had produced its first gas in Bangladesh on May 21, 2013, while testing the Srikail-3 onshore well in the Comilla field. Gazprom has completed drilling at seven wells -- Srikail-3, Titas-19, Titas-20, Titas-21, Titas-22, Begumganj-3 and Semutang-6. Drilling work is underway on Shahbazpur-3. Some of these wells are already supplying natural gas to Bangladesh's national gas grid. Bangladesh is currently grappling with an acute gas crisis, with supply hovering around 2.31 Bcf/d against demand for around 3.0 Bcf/d. Read more...

Dhaka, Bangladesh (BBN)-Bangladesh has produced around 34.449 million tons of rice, basis milled, in FY 2013-14, reports provisional official estimates from the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE). The production is up about 2.7 percent from around 33.833 million tons produced in FY 2012-13, the report added. According to the DAE data, Bangladesh produced around 19.1 million tons of rice from Boro (January - May), up about 2 percent from around 18.778 million tons produced last year, reports Oryza.com. The Asian nation produced around 2.32 million tons of rice from Aus (February - July), up about 8 percent from around 2.15 million tons produced in the previous year. Bangladesh produced around 13.02 million tons of rice from Aman (April - December), up about 1 percent from around 12.897 million tons produced last year. Boro, Aus and Aman contribute to around 7 percent, 38 percent and 55 percent respectively to the total rice production in Bangladesh. Sources from DAE said that the average yield from the three crops in FY 2013-14 was at around 3.03 tons per hectare. They attribute the increase in rice production to the use of high-yielding variety seeds and government support to the rice sector in the form of subsidies in seeds, fertilizers and fuel. The Deputy Director of the DAE told local sources that the total rice production has surpassed the national demand. USDA estimates Bangladesh to produce around 34.8 million tons of rice in MY 2014-15 (May - April), up about 1 percent from an estimated 34.59 million tons in MY 2013-14. It estimates Bangladesh to import around 100,000 tons of rice in 2015, down about 75 percent from an estimated 400,000 tons in 2014. The country's rice consumption needs are estimated at around 34.8 million tons in MY 2014-15 slightly up from an estimated 34.6 million tons in MY 2013-14.   Read more... Qatar (BBN)-Facing incessant criticism for the way it treats its blue-collar labor force, Qatar is calling for changes to the recruitment system that brings millions of workers to the wealthy Persian Gulf region. Recruitment practices in the five countries where most workers come from -Philippines, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India- have led to widespread abuses including debt bondage, forced labor and human trafficking, said a report of Qatar Foundation. Qatar Foundation, a non-profit organisation promoting science and education that is linked to the country’s ruling family, made the 162-page report. For nearly a year now, international human rights organisations have been lambasting Qatar over the plight of its foreign workforce. Wealthy countries in the region have been importing cheap labor from poorer countries in the past two decades to build infrastructure projects but in recent years have drawn more international scrutiny over workers rights and living conditions. The human rights criticism has recently even cast a shadow over -and may yet still derail- Qatar’s plans to host the World Cup in 2022. Qatar had earlier enlisted law firm DLA Piper to conduct a review of foreign workers’ conditions. That report called for an end of the sponsorship system known as kafala under which workers’ passport are often withheld. The report offers some insight into how citizens from Nepal or Bangladesh fall victim to corrupt placement agents and pay prohibitive amounts of money to be allowed to go to Qatar where often they find their wages to be lower than promised but where they are often left without legal recourse. “Many of the report’s findings are consistent with our research into abuses in the recruitment of migrant workers in Indonesia, India and Nepal,” said James Lynch, a researcher on migrant workers in the Gulf for Amnesty International. “The critical need is for governments of destination countries like Qatar and countries of origin to work more effectively together to combat these practices and hold accountable those responsible for what can amount to human trafficking.” With the report, Qatar appears to partially acknowledge some of the criticism directed at the country –it notably called for abuses of the kafala sponsorship system to be addressed– but at the same time shifts the focus of blame to the recruitment system in the countries that send out the workers. “Critics of human and labor rights violations most often shift the blame to “Qatar” in a rather generic manner. Far less attention has been given to the violations by the migrants’ own nationals in their countries of origin in addition to those who are complicit in Qatar,” according to the report. “Human and labor rights violations in the migration process begin prior to the migrant workers leaving their country and often appear to be either ignored by employers, or aided and abetted by employers, upon their arrival in Qatar,” it added. Among several recommendations made in the report, the authors call on Qatar to introduce a minimum wage for construction workers, while standardizing recruitment practices and contracts. They also urge employers in Qatar to bear the recruitment costs and encourage the set-up of a Qatari government-led recruitment agency. “A serious and systematic campaign needs to make clear to all countries of origin and those in Qatar that labor to Qatar must arrive debt-free and without having paid recruitment fees, costs and charges before departure or after arrival from their salaries,” the report said.

Dhaka, Bangladesh (BBN)- The central bank of Bangladesh sent a detailed investigation report on the BASIC Bank Limited to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) on Tuesday for taking legal action against the main accused behind the scam. “We’ve submitted the detailed investigation report on the BASIC Bank to the ACC for taking necessary action in this connection,” a senior official of the Bangladesh Bank (BB) told BBN in Dhaka. He also said the central bank will extend our all cooperation if ACC seeks help to take punitive actions against the person responsible for the state-owned bank scam. The central bank earlier found different types of irregularities by the BASIC Bank in providing loans, which include non-verification of customer's creditworthiness, absence of ‘know your customer (KYC)’ procedures, and extending loans to defaulters. The BB investigations detected financial irregularities involving around BDT 45 billion of loans in the three branches located at Gulshan, Dilkusha and Shantinagar in Dhaka between 2009 and 2013.

Citigroup will pay $4bn (£bn) to the Department of Justice and $2.5bn for \"consumer relief\", reports BBC. Following the decision, the bank reported a stronger than predicted quarterly profit, and saw its share price rise by 3.02% to $48.42 (£28.34). Second-quarter earnings fell by 96% to $181m, but that was after a $3.8bn (£2.2bn) charge related to the settlement. The settlement stems from the sale of securities made up of sub-prime mortgages, which were at the centre of the 2008 financial crisis. Citigroup is the second major bank to pay a settlement since President Obama launched an investigation into housing loans. The Citigroup fines are said to have surprised stock analysts and people inside the bank, who had hoped to settle for less. According to the US Attorney General, Eric Holder, \"under the terms of this settlement, the bank has admitted to its misdeeds in great detail\". He said the settlement \"does not absolve Citigroup or its employees from facing any possible criminal charges in the future\". Citigroup's chief executive, Michael L Corbat, said that the decision was the right one for shareholders. \"We believe that this settlement is in the best interests of our shareholders, and allows us to move forward and to focus on the future, not the past,\" he said.

            "text": "Israel announced it will agree to an Egyptian-backed ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the security cabinet has stated. However, the peace plan looks in ruins, with Hamas rejecting the initiative, saying “this proposal is not acceptable.”\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet had convened to vote on the deal at Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv. The agreement was made minutes before the proposed truce was due to come into effect at 06:00 GMT. The ceasefire will come into effect immediately.\n\nAmos Gilad, a senior Israeli defense official and envoy to Cairo, cast the deal in a positive light, saying Hamas had been weakened by the air and sea bombardment of impoverished Gaza.\n\n\"Look at the balance, and you see that Hamas tried every possible means of striking at Israel while bringing great and terrible damage on its people, from their perspective,\" Gilad told Israel's Army Radio. However, Hamas says it’s likely to reject an Egyptian ceasefire proposal for the current Israel-Gaza conflict. The militant group said it had not officially received the text of the agreement, but believed it to be \"an initiative of kneeling and submission.\"\n\nSami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official rejected the proposal because it was deemed to be unacceptable. Previously, the al-Qassam Brigades had shown little interest in getting to the negotiation table.\n\n“Our battle with the enemy continues and will increase in ferocity and intensity,” the group stated.\n\nPalestinian sources told Haaretz that despite recent declarations by Hamas officials in opposition to the Egyptian offer, it is possible that in the next few hours Hamas' political leadership will hold direct talks with Egyptian intelligence in an effort to accept the cease-fire proposal.\n\nHamas' political chief Khaled Meshal or his deputy Ismail Haniyeh is expected to release an official statement later Tuesday. The statement depends on how the talks between Hamas' leadership and Egypt progress in the coming hours.\n\nIsrael sees in the Egyptian-proposed Gaza truce an opportunity to strip the Palestinian enclave of rockets but is prepared to redouble military action there if the cross-border launches persist, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday.\n\n\"We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarisation of the (Gaza) Strip - from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels - through diplomatic means,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"But if Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet,\" Netanyahu added.\n\nPalestinian militants in the Gaza Strip fired rockets at Israel on Tuesday after the Israeli government accepted, and Hamas Islamists said they rejected, an Egyptian-proposed ceasefire.\n\nLive television showed the Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepting several rockets over the port city of Ashdod and sirens sounded in other parts of southern Israel. Israel Radio said a factory in Ashdod was hit, but there was no immediate word of casualties.\n\nChannel Two TV said 10 rockets had been launched. The Israeli military, which said it had stopped its attacks in Gaza, reported before the Ashdod strike that three rockets had been fired since the ceasefire deal was to have gone into effect.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday morning, three rockets were fired from Egypt towards the southern Israeli resort of Eilat. Four civilians were injured, according to Israeli security officials. They added that they believed the rockets were fired by Islamist militants in the Egyptian Sinai in an attempt to derail Cairo’s efforts to mediate a truce between Israel and Palestine and put an end to the week-long shelling of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn response to the Egyptian proposal, Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said on Monday that his movement would not accept any truce that excludes the conditions of the Palestinian groups and people, as quoted by Israeli media.\n\nIn a televised address, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh praised the role of Hamas fighters and denounced the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip.\n\n“The problem is not the truce, but the siege and starvation of Gaza Strip,” Haniyeh stressed. \"The problem is not going back to the agreement on calm because we want this aggression to stop.\"\n\nSince the start of Israel's military operation on Tuesday, 184 people – mostly civilians – have been killed by airstrikes in Gaza, Palestinian medics said.",

It concocted the proposal in order to seek legitimization of its genocidal project in Gaza.\n\n15 July, 2014 AIC\n\n Hamas and Islamic Jihad stated Tuesday that they were never consulted over the terms of a proposed truce with Israel that was drafted by Egypt. The Israeli prime minister stated that if Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, it will be legitimate for Israel to broaden its military operation against the Gaza Strip.\n\n“To avoid confusion and to be clear with our people, al-Qassam Brigades confirm that we haven’t been contacted by any official or unofficial entities about terms of this alleged initiative,” said the Azz a Din al Qassam brigades in a statement.\n\n“If what has been circulated is true, this initiative means kneeling and submissiveness and so we completely refuse it and to us, it’s not worth the ink used in writing it,” the military organization added.\n\nSenior Islamic Jihad official Khalid al-Batsh welcomed Egypt’s role, but said that there was only contact between Egypt and Israel. He stressed the Islamic Jihad was never consulted.\n\n“Initiatives shouldn’t be proposed through media outlets, but rather through the obvious channels, which are resistance factions and their leaders”, al-Batsh stated.\n\nDeputy secretary-general of the group, Ziad al-Nakhalah, said late Monday that there couldn’t be a ceasefire agreement without guarantees to end Israeli aggression and the blockade on Gaza.\n\n“We are open to any initiative, but rocket fire won’t stop unless a real and appropriate agreement is reached,” he added.\n\nIsrael’s security cabinet on Tuesday accepted the Egyptian ceasefire proposal, a government spokesman said, after a week of deadly bombings on Gaza which killed over 180 Palestinians.\n\n“The cabinet has decided to accept the Egyptian initiative for a ceasefire starting 9am today,” Ofir Gendelman, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Twitter.\n\n“We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarization of the (Gaza) Strip – from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels – through diplomatic means,” he told reporters during an earlier press conference with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier.\n\nThe Prime Minister added, “but if Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet.”",

Here are some of the stories we're following today:\n\nIsrael’s Cabinet voted today to accept an Egypt-brokered cease-fire to end the violence with Hamas that has ramped up over the past week. But there was no sign that Hamas militants want to abide by the truce, and now Israel appears to want to back out as well. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also hinted that a ground invasion is still on the table. “If Hamas does not accept the cease-fire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet,” Netanyahu told reporters.

As many as 500 demonstrators may gather to protest the children, who will receive temporary housing. Robert Skiba, who’s organizing the protest, told NBC News that they learned about the housing placement from the local sheriff, and not federal officials. “We’re supposed to be having a transparent government, but this deal was cut in the cover of darkness. They never offered to have a public meeting and answer questions,” Skiba said. Read more in LATINO.\n\nGot the summertime blues? Cold air from Canada is descending into parts of the western U.S. and northern Plains, while parts of the Northeast could see a slight dip in temperatures in what is normally a steamy July.

Read more in NEWS.\n\nThe mother of fallen 2nd Lt. Darryn Andrews said she’s upset that rescued Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl will be allowed to return to active duty. Andrews was in the platoon of soldiers killed in September 2009, when his family says he was sent to search for Bergdahl after he vanished off base. The circumstances surrounding his disappearance remain foggy, as Bergdahl has been recovering since the Army retrieved him in a controversial swap with the Taliban in May.

the author might be missing seven periods of church history by lumping all christians together with the roman ecumenical assembly the roman catholic church some are escaping sardis beginning during the reformation named protestant coming out of thyatira and others philadelphia were and as now are never in the rcc its a subject that has been well confused by satan it should be noted that many of the christians around the world that are being persecuted right now are roman catholics the rcc exists as satans false bodyassembly of christ aka church which is mystery babylon within the thyatira assembly period the suffering of catholic christians might be seen as fulfillment of revelation 22123 and yes i believe that there are true christians in all the assemblies i just wonder about these

likely candidate to be the antichrists empire although the reestablished kurdish kingdom is also viable islam now controls the area of the greek empire the lawlessone a pope and the rcc are not technically antichrists as they do not deny the father and the son they add the queen of heaven which aligns with islams moon gods both the rcc and islam hate israel as israel is fulfilling biblical prophecy isaiah668 contrast israel denies jesus is the son of god they were blinded to this romans 11 but they do not deny the father and the son psalm 2 in a sense both the rcc and islam represent

ynet news july 28 hes trying to save hamas obama at risk for serious expose of his administrations involvment in hamas terror hamas better fits the new world order than israel obamas one world vision in his own words washington post july 23 weï¿½re trying to see if we can put together a government that actually can function to ongoing terrorist threats to whatï¿½s happening in israel and gaza part of peoples concern is just the sense that around the world the old order isnï¿½t holding and weï¿½re not quite yet to where we need to be in terms of a new order thatï¿½s based on a different set of principles thatï¿½s based on a sense of common humanity thatï¿½s based on economies that work for all people in other words he is addtionally and applying weï¿½re trying to see if we can put together a government that actually can function to israel that is he is trying to put together a government different from the israeli government the washington post writer may not hear the punctuation here but that is what he said obama acts like he may or may not understand what he is saying that is he acts like a dolt by playing a lot of golf and having parties at the white house but most certainly he is not a stupid vain man acting without purpose hes a smart vain purposeful man satans promise appeals to human vanity you will be as god gen34 that rappers are getting high in the white house reflect obamas vanity primacy and is very indicative that obama does not care about the children his policy brings to the usas southern border so he is also quite spiritually ill the sate of israel does fulfill biblical prophecy irregardless of whether or not this government is secular and so satan and his government ministers possibly sometimes even in israel are against that satan said i will make myself like the most high isa14134 and god said satan transfigures himself as an angel of light 2 cor111415 so a lot of folks that are not at all religious will become converted in the near future rev1334 obama to netanyahu i demand that israel agree to a unilateral ceasefire and stop all offensive actions ï¿½ especially air strikes jihad watch july 29 an important article by caroline glick our world israel hamas and obamaï¿½s foreign policy jerusalem post july 29 americans are the ones who need to be most alarmed by what obamaï¿½s actions on behalf of hamas reveal about the general direction of american middle east policy under his leadership for the past five years americans from all quarters have concluded that the manifold failures of obamaï¿½s middle east policies ï¿½ from iraq to iran libya afghanistan egypt syria israel the palestinian authority and beyond ï¿½ owe to a combination of obamaï¿½s personal disinterest in foreign affairs and his presumed preference for withdrawal and isolationism over engagement obama himself has often encouraged this perception with his endless golf games and his talk about fighting ï¿½the war at homeï¿½ obamaï¿½s open public engagement in hamasï¿½s war against israel shows that the popular assessment is wrong obama is as involved in the middle east as all of his immediate predecessors were he is personally leading us policy on every front kerry is not an independent actor the problem is that in every war in every conflict and in every contest of wills that has occurred in the middle east since obama took office he has sided with iran and the muslim brotherhood against americaï¿½s allies under obama america has switched sides more of this obama smidgens and smidgens caintv july 30 this is islam jihadists in iraq

concept of controlling rural areas by regulation on the one hand blaming the water loss on unregulated ground water use more than 75 per cent of the loss was due to the rapid depletion of groundwater from underground aquifers that many farmers depend on for irrigation reality in colorado as in colorado river water has been very regulated since the 1800s the researchers found the rate of decline of groundwater much of which is nonrenewable and poorly managed was roughly six times greater than the losses in lake mead and lake powell another large reservoir further upstream on the colorado river further upstream in other words california and las vegas have always mismanaged water authorities are spending more than 800m to tunnel under lake mead to maintain access to water because the stunted flow of the colorado river means the lake has shrunk so much that two higher tunnels may no longer be able to channel water to las vegas and other cities so the cities not the farmers are using the surface water the rapid rates of groundwater depletion are likely to lead to further falls in colorado river stream flows so the article contradicts itself here the studyï¿½s authors say declines in the snowpack that feeds the river and population growth could threaten the longterm ability of the colorado river basin to meet water allocation commitments to the seven basin states which includes california and to mexico apparently nothing feeds the aquifers they are saying groundwater use is diminishing the flow of water into the colorado river dam and also saying that the groundwater use is occurring below dam while calling for more restrictive use regulations above the dam this is a hit on rural independent lifestyles and nothing more obamas border fiasco rick perry deploys national

organization hamas didnt stop firing rockest so israel says they resume op ynetnews july 15 prime minister benjamin netanyahu said tuesday that hamas rejection of the cease fire gives israel full legitimacy to expand the operation to protect our people we agreed to the egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarization of the gaza strip from missiles from rockets and from tunnels through diplomatic means he told reporters during an earlier press conference with german foreign minister frankwalter steinmeier but if hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal as would now seem to be the case israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet historically this kind of nonsense only yields the lie of international legitimacy to islamic terrorism and antisemitism which in the islamic reality means anyone jewish of course the obama backed truce is designed to give hamas time to reload iran rearms

israelis half of countrys population in bomb shelters truth revolt july 8 donate israel bomb shelters httpwwwoperationlifeshieldorgdonate after many many rockets over many years and after a long delay with the recent increase in rocket attacks israel decides to go after hamas in gaza noting isis is in gaza and the west bank areas of israel already and isis is in syria and on the border of jordan it seems hamas has been allowed to be sort of a strawman terrorist organization in gaza that is israel has let them blather away and shoot missiles into fields and in return hamas sort of keeps other islamic terror groups from getting too close so with the approach of isis hamas has a choice fight them or join them there is no money in making peace with israel obviously hamas best short and long term option so they would likely join isis and isis presence recently documented among hamas shows this to be the case so israel has to go through hamas in order to help jordan but of course hezbollah better trained than hamas may jump in and israels intervention may be timed to stop that so it seems likely that isis will also attack from the north border of israel they will use israels policing of hamas as fodder to call in help from muslims around the world a rallying cry from the new caliphate beyond that isis may still be a pawn of iran and or turkeywaiting for a war weakened israel when

the united states will never give up on the hope of a lasting peace which is the only path to true security for israel obama distinguishes hezbollahï¿½s and hamasï¿½s rockets and finally laments the tragic deaths of naftali fraenkel gilad shaar and eyal yifrach then he laments the senseless death of mohammed hussein abu khdeir perhaps noting a familiar connection then he equates the actions of the idf with hamas and hezbollah terrorists in saying all parties must protect the innocent and act with reasonableness and restraint not vengeance and retribution among the other lies such as peace and security see un charters preamble at least part of one obama statement here is true just as the israeli people have the right to live in the historic homeland of the jewish people the palestinian people deserve the right to selfdetermination in other words jews have historic rights to the land of israel and the palestinians have the right to imaginedetermine that they do while it is not beneficial exd 2016 for the palestinians to think whatever they want ie make things up but that is their prerogative unfortunately obama considers that the figment of their fervent and fanatical imagination should be realized with a final solution of an islamic state within the jewish homeland it is a blessing to have trust that god has great plans for ethnic israels greater fullness rom1112

state of israel is in the midst of a campaign for the restoration of peace and security to our citizens will not tolerate rocket fire on towns and iishobino so i ordered a significant expansion of the idf operation against hamas and terrorists against the terrorists of other terrorist organizations in the gaza strip i did it only after all attempts to restore the peace hamas refused and opted for escalation we battle but confidence our citizens and our children first do whatever is necessary so that peace is prevailing here in recent years will continue the idf operation aimed against the terrorists of hamas and against innocent civilians while hamas deliberately hiding behind civilians and thus is liable when they get hurt accidentally citizens of israel i ask you to abide by

africa to fight in iraqï¿½s notorious isis islamic state of iraq and the levant and yet another view on turkey from caroline glick turkeyï¿½s highrisk power play caroline glick june 25 2014 while turkey and iran are rivals in undermining the international system their goals are the same and their strategies for achieving their goals are also similar but while their chaos strategy is brilliant in its way it is also high risk by its very nature chaos is hard if not impossible to control situations often get out of hand plans backfire what we are seeing today in syria and iraq and the wider region demonstrates the chaos strategyï¿½s drawbacks as pinchas inbari detailed in a recent report for the jerusalem center for public affairs the syrian civil war is causing millions of syrians to leave the country and their migrations are changing the face of many countries for instance their arrival in lebanon has transformed the multiethnic state into one with a preponderant sunni majority thus watering down hezbollahï¿½s support base the kurds in iraq may feel they need turkey today but there is no reason to assume that this will remain the case for long noting again that isisisil is not a big military operation ragtag yes fanatics yes rich gangbanger yes isis might not last forever shoebat june 19 2014 note this guy a christian says that turkey is the leopard of scripture prophecy that is the kind of things that christians do christians say things compare with the muslims around the world muslims behead people muslims behead other muslims see the difference june 29 so some acts in this play isis is on the border of bahgdad saudi arabia syria jordan and northern israel oh and the usas southern border is open to them thanks to obama as the little kids there are just a cover and when they grow up they will vote for a democrat but their parents can vote for democrats now see nancy pelosi on the border and of course also into play is obamas antigun policy with the riffraff of mexico and centralsouth america as new citizens real americans will be more likely to agree with the line that the second amendment rights should be infringed upon also the republican machine is happy too as cheap labor really enslavement of all arrives and obamas racial dividing continues however if this season never ends the current hispanic vote will soon go all republican as they will be loosing their jobs to lower wage workers so the republicans are playing acting a fine line on whether they want a new slave labor force or not understand by looking at third world countries where we are headingwe can subsist on very littlewith very fewas the open border allows disease to spread not talking common colds here we dont take care of our own homeless so of course the s border fiasco is a sideshow a purposeful sideshow there are more things simultaneously connected here but this is sufficient to show that obama is not acting in ignorance us jordan may ask israel to go to war against isil timesofisrael june 28 2014 if hamas were normal minded they too would take note of isis mass murder of other muslims and get aligned with israel instead of kidnapping jewish boys of course hamas might think that isis might not last forever also noting on friday a senior israeli military commander announced that almost the entire syrian side of the golan heights is now

and anathematize every heresy that raises against the holy orthodox and catholic faith which we have above explained condemning all heretics under whatever names they may be known for while they have different faces they are nevertheless bound to each other by their tails since in all of them vanity is a common element those condemned being handed over to the secular rulers of their bailiffs let them be abandoned to be punished with due justice clerics being first degraded from their orders as to the property of the condemned if they are laymen let it be confiscated if clerics let it be applied to the churches from which they received revenues but those who are only suspected due consideration being given to the nature of the suspicion and the character of the person unless they prove their innocence by a proper defense let them be anathematized and avoided by all 1intil they have made suitable satisfaction but if they have been under excommunication for one year then let them be condemned as heretics secular authorities whatever office they may hold shall be admonished and induced and if necessary compelled by ecclesiastical censure that as they wish to be esteemed and numbered among the faithful so for the defense of the faith they ought publicly to take an oath that they will strive in good faith and to the best of their ability to exterminate in the territories subject to their jurisdiction all heretics pointed out by the church so that whenever anyone shall have assumed authority whether spiritual or temporal let him be bound to confirm this decree by oath but if a temporal ruler after having been requested and admonished by the church should neglect to cleanse his territory of this heretical foulness let him be excommunicated by the metropolitan and the other bishops of the province if he refuses to make satisfaction within a year let the matter be made known to the supreme pontiff that he may declare the rulers vassals absolved from their allegiance and may offer the territory to be ruled lay catholics who on the extermination of the heretics may possess it without hindrance and preserve it in the purity of faith the right however of the chief ruler is to be respected as long as he offers no obstacle in this matter and permits freedom of action the same law is to be observed in regard to those who have no chief rulers that is are independent catholics who have girded themselves with the cross for the extermination of the heretics shall enjoy the indulgence s and privileges granted to those who go in defense of the

unusual move the police instead opened the temple mount to 400 jewish visitors and did not cause the religious jewish visitors any delays or problems like they normally do there have been proposals to create a timesharing arrangement on the temple mount so jews can pray there without being harassed by hamas inciters if today works out smoothly perhaps this will become a more permanent arrangement

to connect with jesus the answer is to live like a jew tablet feb 4 oy the messianic s state of the union what constitutes a replacement theology key quotes these are nonjews who have no intention of converting to judaism yet follow laws customs beliefs and practices commonly associated with judaism many wear tzitzit many keep kosher and observe the sabbath and jewish holidays some of the men have beards and peyos some have even undergone adult circumcision andor have circumcised their children and many are fulfilling mitzvot that arenï¿½t explicitly stated or detailed in the torah such as praying the rabbinic liturgy and observing hanukkah and so they too add to the law which god forbids deut42 which they claim to follow just as the jews did and do the jews have an excuse god blinded them romans 118 but how much more their fullness future ro1112 these folks say they are not christians apparently because they dont celebrate christmas or easter and not jews at least t hey have apparently figured out that messianic means the same thing as christian and while they do believe that jesus christ is the son of god and the messiahï¿½though in these circles he goes exclusively by his hebrew name yeshuaï¿½they are emphatically not christian i suppose that is why the term hebrewroots is used messianic of course is hebrew for the english christian which is a transliteration of the new testament greek word ÏÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ¹Î±Î½Î¿ÏÏ see acts 1126 and they hebrewrooters are not christians hebrew roots then is arguably the first nonjewish movement to approach torah the way contemporary jews do in fact they are striving to be jews followers of hebrew roots believe that christian practice has been over the last two millennia corrupted by pagan influences and like to say that theyï¿½re aiming for a pure firstcentury version of their religion they should read the book of jude to get an idea of what the 1st assembly was like and oh foolish galatians also comes to mind quickly in other words they want to understand and observe the torah the way they believe their messiah yeshua did that is likely an accurate statement their mind is made up there is quite a bit of humor here also in another room about 50 people were practicing israeli folk dance though here it was called davidic dance and it was regarded as a form of prayer a very telling observation they are making things up ie they want to understand and observe the torah the way they believe what the jew sees the author is jewish i asked camero as i asked everyone else i met why he doesnï¿½t simply convert to judaism there arenï¿½t usually shofars at an orthodox service and very rarely is there a microphone that aside the service was to a remarkable degree orthodox being jewish it seemed was something to brag about a mark of authenticity of something that at least overtly wasnï¿½t supposed to matter epilogue virtually everyone i spoke to at revive had similar stories about how they originally got involved with hebrew roots they had been raised baptist evangelical seventh day adventistï¿½one or another christian denomination that takes the bible very seriously many not all have lost their first love jesus note that just as there are different definitions of what constitutes a christian so too with messianic even if you call that hebrewroots begs this question how many times

be honoured with a memorial in poets corner westminster abbey lewis converted to christianity in 1931 wikipedia astutely notes after his conversion to christianity his interests gravitated towards christian spirituality and away from pagan celtic mysticism and lewis later married joy davidman gresham a jewish american writer due to lewiss approach to religious belief as a skeptic and his following conversion he has been called the apostle to the skeptics in a muchcited passage from mere christianity lewis challenged the view that jesus although a great moral teacher was not god he argued that jesus made several implicit claims to divinity which would logically exclude this i am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about him im ready to accept jesus as a great moral teacher but i dont accept his claim to be god that is the one thing we must not say a man who was merely a man and said the sort of things jesus said would not be a great moral teacher he would either be a lunatic ï¿½ on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg ï¿½ or else he would be the devil of hell you must make your choice either this man was and is the son of god or else a madman or something worse you can shut him up for a fool you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him lord and god but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher he has not left that open to us he did not intend to although widely repeated in christian apologetic literature it has been largely ignored by professional theologians and biblical scholars lewis on natural law which he also termed moral law these then are the two points that i wanted to make first that human beings all over the earth have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way and can not really get rid of it secondly that they do not in fact behave in that way they know the law of nature they break it these two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in lewis wrote what we now call the chronicles of narnia readers of his fiction are often unaware of what lewis considered the christian themes of his works im not sold on the chronicles of narnia but as i recall the apostle paul wrote something along the lines of whatever it takes

minutes biblical creation facebook july 31 scientist robert gentry made a remarkable discovery many years ago when examining granite rocks a makeup of the earths crust he found that they contained radiohalos which are a remnant of the element polonium evolutionists believe the earth was once hot magma and the magma cooled and became the earths crust over billions of years the magma would have burned up the polonium so therefore the earth did not form this way a half life of the element polonium218 is 3 minutesmeaning the earth itself was formed in less than 3 minutes next to dna this was

terrorists httpswwwfacebookcomisraelipmposts686222108059204 following is the text of an open letter to the citizens of israel from prime minister benjamin netanyahu ahead of the proposal to resume the diplomatic process that will be submitted to the cabinet tomorrow sunday 28 july 2013 from time to time prime ministers are called on to make decisions that go against public opinion ï¿½ when the matter is important for the country in order to make decisions that are supported by the public there is no need for prime ministers say what at the present time it seems to me that it is very important for the state of israel to enter into a diplomatic process this is important both in order to exhaust the chance of ending the conflict with the palestinians and in order to establish israels position in the complex international reality around us the major changes in our region ï¿½ in egypt syria and in iran ï¿½ not only place challenges before the state of israel but they also create considerable opportunities for us for these reasons i believe that it is important for the state of israel to enter a diplomatic process that will continue for at least nine months ï¿½ in order to check if it is possible to reach an agreement with the palestinians during this time but even with all of the importance that i ascribe to the diplomatic process i was not prepared to accept the palestinians demands for withdrawals and freezes as preconditions for entering negotiations neither was i prepared to accept their demand to release palestinian prisoners before the start of negotiations i did agree to release 104 palestinians in stages after the start of the negotiations and in accordance with the circumstances of their progress this is an incomparably difficult decision it is painful for the bereaved families and it is painful for the entire nation and it is also very painful for me it collides with the incomparably important value of justice exactly and yet he proceeds to do injustice it is a clear injustice when depraved people even if most of them have sat in prison for over 20 years as in this case are released before they have finished serving their sentences the decision is difficult for me sevenfold because my family and i personally know the price of bereavement stemming from terrorism i know the pain very well i have lived with it every day for the past 37 years the fact that previous israeli governments have released over 10000 terrorists does not make it easier for me today and did not make it easier when i decided to bring back gilad shalit gilad shalits return home entailed an incomparably difficult decision for me ï¿½ releasing terrorists but i believed that the value of bringing children back home needed to overcome this difficulty people in positions of leadership need to choose between complex choices and sometimes the necessary decision is especially difficult when most of the public opposes it thus i decided to end operation pillar of defense after the elimination of archterrorist ahmed jabari and after the severe blows the idf dealt to hamas and the other terrorist organizations i made the decision to end the operation even though most of the public supported continued action which would have required entering the gaza strip on the ground as prime minister i thought that the goal of deterrence had been mostly achieved by the determined actions that we carried out today almost one year after the end of operation pillar of defense we are witness to the quietest situation in the south in over a decade of course this quiet can fray at any minute but my policy is clear on all fronts we will as much as possible foil threats against us in a timely manner we will react strongly to any attempt to harm our people in the next nine months we will consider whether there is a palestinian element opposite us that like us truly wants to end the conflict between us such a conclusion will be possible only under conditions that will ensure security for israels citizens and ensure our vital national interests if we succeed in achieving such a peace agreement i will submit it to a referendum such a fateful decision can not be made by a close vote in the knesset every citizen must be allowed to directly influence our future and our fate on such a crucial issue the best answer we can give to those same base murderers that sought to defeat us through terrorism is that in the decades that they sat in prison we built a glorious country and turned it into one of the most prosperous advanced and strongest countries in the world i promise that we will continue thus yours benjamin netanyahu it seems that as a precondition for the palestinians who do not accept any border with israel to negotiate peace with israel israel is freeing palestinian terrorists this is crazy on the right hand the woman cries justice justice justice bayit yehudi pm elected to make right not difficult decisions israel national news july 27 shaked told reporters ï¿½the prime minister wasnï¿½t elected to make difficult decisions he was elected to make the right decisionsï¿½ ï¿½the government forgot

and a new dayï¿½ according to sender ï¿½ the sun rising over the horizon evoked a new sense of hope of course the power of the logo had a lot to do with the power of the candidateï¿½s message the meaning of obamas symbol alessatheisraeliblogspotcom an islamic prophecy the hour the last days will not come until the sun rises from the west islamic commentary states that one interpretation of the above prediction is that the sun or the light of islam the truth of islam according to them will shine in the western nations and be received well ï¿½ another interpretation from islamic commentary is that the sun is a messenger a person a leader who will come out of the western nations and not only be positive toward islam but help promote islam and protect and defend islam and eventually many will be converted to it louis farrakhan made this statement while speaking to a group of young people prior to the election of obama and he was talking about his friend obama he said ï¿½you are the instrument that god is going to use to bring about universal change and that is why barack has captured the youth and he has involved young people in the political process that they didnï¿½t care anything about ï¿½ thatï¿½s a sign when the messiah speaks the youth will hear and the messiah is absolutely speakingï¿½ not that anyone should believe louis farrakhan but this is what he and others

further decision to proceed as well with the indictment and arrest of joseph ratzingers successor as pope on the same charges and to enforce the commercial lien and easter reclamation campaign against

works of god have been appropriated to the pope says rev dr edgar by theologians canonists popes and councils in the 4th session of the 5th lateran council ï¿½ december 10 1512 and with the approbation of the council christopher marcellus thus publicly addressed the pope in the name of the church thou art pastor thou physician thou governor thou supporter t hou in fine another god on the earth according to innocent iii the pope holds the place of the true god the canon law in the gloss denominates the pope our lord god and the canonists say that the pope is the one god who has all power in heaven and in earth the canon law also declares that the pope has the plenitude of power and is above righ t he changes the substantial nature of things for example by transforming the unlawful into lawful vs 89 whom the one lawless get that vain torah observance religion out of your head for a secondinstead think of course satan is lawless even prelawsinai so too his agents are lawless as a satan the serpent the dragon appears as a minister of light therefore he appears to keep the law ie he would even be seen as a doer the lawworks the slo called messyantic assembly should stop calling other members lawless because the messyantics dont think they keep the law no one keeps or can keep some 240 of the 613 commandments thus the self professed torah observant is actually truly lawless in that they are have not the law they say they keep and in reality they lack the ability to keep the law but as this shows praise yah we are not under the law vs 7 the one holding fast

is amazing that many messianics mimic this song and dance pony show routine hear o israel for thereis one god one mediator also ofgod and ofmen the man messiah jesus 1tim25 rabbinical judaism the false foundation of much messyantic hebrew roots is of course also antichrist in rejecting that jesus is yhvh jehovahs witnesses are also antichrist muslims are also antichrist many in the messianic

daniel 430 that satanic pride brought nebuchadnezzar down much talk about how well prepared we are compared to others noting matthew 255 all ten virgins slumbered and slept shush now baby dont you cry the highlight of the night was the rabbis deadpan comment after the 2nd act of the opera the fat lady cant sing i paraphrase if the jewish new testaments paraphrasing of god is ok certainly it is ok to paraphrase a rabbi it was almost realized that everything prior to the cross is old testament almost however apparently without that realization the assistant once again dutifully pointed out that passage in matthew 517 mightyou not suppose that icame tooverthrow the law or the prophets icame not tooverthrow but tofulfill this statement was spoken by jesus before the cross to jews therefore of course there was not yet a new covenanttestament as a willtestament does not take effect until the death of the testator so of course jesus instructed jews to continue following the law and the prophets also note that of course jesus then did fulfill the law and prophets hence it is finished and the old gives way to the new covenant as per the rest of the story the book to the hebrews details this wonderfully i suspect that most in this assembly do not believe that jesus did what he said he would do in mt517 that is fulfill the law my wife had a super succinct analogy to depict this ongoing error in many so called messianic assemblies that seek to follow the sinai law suppose you owe mr g 1000 mr j comes along and says ive paid that in full for you you dont owe anything now would you keep making payments to mr g update mar 3 matt 51719 came up on a facebook page so again this is a fantastic passage for one in showing so much the lovingkindness of the father in that even whosoever therefore might break one of these commandants namely the least and he might teach the men thus this one will be in the kingdom of heaven and will there be called the least also moreover showing that this is possible in the fact that jesusyeshua came and did fulfill the law romans 104 galatians this of course aligns with what therefore the advantage of the jew of romans 312 both to jew first and to greek in romans 116 and in how much more their fullness seen in romans 1112 keeping in mind that matthew 5 was before the cross hence of course there was as yet not a new testamentcovenant there was not yet the death of the testator so the old covenant is still in effect and thus yeshua teaches until the cross there was not yet a better covenant the book of hebrews well distinguishes the old and new covenants ie heb 109 and again 2 corinthians 3 explains as romans 11 that some get it some dont to those that get the good news ie that trust in yeshuajesus he is the end of the law rom 104we shouldnt shrink back heb 1038 for those that dont get jesus the law is still remaining a disciplining tutor gal32325 in either case to all these that fear him yhvhs lovingkindness is manifest to us in matthew 51719 praise yah and so too we also keep the commandment to in mind not to think of any brother as numbskulls or stupid matt522 thank you for your

review noting additionally that sefer hayasher details coincidently with this weeks torah portion how the tribe of ephraim was unsuccessful in breaking out of gods timeline before the appointed time also noting that that rock was christ that followed israel in the wilderness for 40 years and that moses was denied entry to the promised land because he struck that rock instead of speaking to it as god commanded thinking there is the way that allows israel to meander off its the ways straightness and still be ok this is seen in the redemptionback of romans 324 meanwhile those in messiah the assembly called out nt believers of the assembly called out israel under the law are to put on the mind of the messiah that is the messiah is the head of this the body so then we in messiah are already echad or one in messiah spiritually israel is not that yet not yet married but betrothed they are enemies for the goodnewsjesus sake but beloved for the sake of the election of the fathers so we watch them meander around who is the good shepard yeshua he followed israel for 40 years in the wilderness we are to be like him and put on the mind of messiah i think he said to feed his sheep so israel is given the oracles of god equated to a sword we are stones laid upon the cornerstone and foundation stone jesus if you strike a rock with a sword you will damage the blade however a stone if used properly will sharpen the sword we are to be lively stones ever sharpening the word of the lord noting too that apparently messiah didnt follow the ephraimites above that said danielstimelinecom httpwwwdanielstimelinecomdanielstimelinehtml daniel 924 seventy weeks are decreed upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy thus they say that there are 70 years from some beginning point gods rest daniel 925 know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times that is at 69 years from this commandment to restore build jerusalem messiah will return from the going forth of the commandment this was fullfilled at the commandment un resolution 181 on nov 291947 thus 1947 69 2016 daniel 926 and after the threescore and two weeks shall the anointed one be cut off and shall have nothing and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and even unto the end shall be war desolations are determined thus their reckoning after 62 years messiah is cut off but not for himself this is seven years before the above return of messiah i wonder where in their timeline messiah returns before the cut off date of 62 weeksyears 2009 note that daniel does not call this period tribulation that is something this ministry is adding in daniel 927 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate the temple does not have to be completely rebuilt to fulfill dan 927 prophecy if a corner stone is set the court can be measured to establish the location of the altar then with the altar up and operating this prophecy is satisfied this was the same procedure used to rebuild the temple in ancient times too the walls were restored after the altar was operating if you follow the website link the video further details that the alter is reinstated in feb 2013 the abomination that maketh desolate of daniel 1211 is set up on march 22 nissan 11 2013 and that messiah returns on oct 17 of 2016 shavuot of interest israel just as of jan 3013 has completed building the alter for the 3rd temple this is primarily my reason for posting so much of the above info from wwwdanielstimelinecom so just as a little something to keep in mind israel now has completed the construction of the alter last week they moved the laver note in dan 927 below from asv 1901 and he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and upon the wing of abominations shall come one that maketh desolate and even unto the full end and that determined shall wrath be poured out upon the desolate note the difference upon the wing and for the overspreading wing overspreading are from ×Ö°Ö¼× Ö·×£

jesus referred to his body as the sanctuary josephus the wars of the jews book 5 ch 5 a description of the temple vs5 but the innermost part of the temple of all was twenty cubits this was also separated from the outer part by a veil in this there was nothing at all this is why is is wrong to say you should face the east to pray this is why it is wrong to say you should not face the east to pray if you are still drinking milk and playing games with the word and the veil this wont make sense to you thats probably ok be anxious for no thing talkin bout hanukkah an interesting story about

the original catholic universal assembly was the true assembly the roman catholic church is not the true assembly although it is an assembly and is referred to in revelation the 6th world power was the roman empire with which satan persecuted jews mainly the jews were dispersed as god said they would be into all nations satan changed his power source so that he could chase jews the roman empire

The author might be missing seven periods of \"church\" history by lumping all Christians together with the Roman Ecumenical Assembly (the Roman Catholic Church). Some are escaping (Sardis, beginning during the Reformation, named \"protestant\", coming out of Thyatira), and others (Philadelphia) were (and as now are) never in the RCC). It's a subject that has been well confused by Satan.\n\n \n\n It should be noted that many of the \"christians\" around the world that are being persecuted right now are Roman Catholics. The RCC exists as Satan's false \"body/assembly of Christ\" (A.K.A. \"church\" which is Mystery Babylon within the Thyatira assembly period. The suffering of Catholic Christians might be seen as fulfillment of Revelation. 2:21-23 - and yes, I believe that there are true Christians in all the assemblies. I just wonder about these things...\n\n \n\n Mosul is the area of Ninevah. Baghdad is the area of Babylon (ancient physical city).\n\n Both Assyria/Syria and Babylon are represented historically by a winged lion.\n\n ISIS, or the Islamic State seems a likely candidate to be the Anti-Christ's empire, although the re-established Kurdish kingdom is also viable. Islam now controls the area of the Greek empire. The lawless-one (a pope), and the RCC are not technically anti-christ(s), as they do not deny the Father and the Son. They add the Queen of Heaven, which aligns with Islam's moon gods. Both the RCC and Islam hate Israel, as Israel is fulfilling biblical prophecy (Isaiah.66:8). (Contrast - Israel denies Jesus is the Son of God - they were blinded to this (Romans 11), but they do not deny the Father and the Son - Psalm 2.) In a sense both the RCC and Islam represent the beast that \"was and is not and is to come\" (Rev. 17:11) - Mystery Babylon, Nimrod's ancient kingdom.

The Washington Post writer may not hear the punctuation here, but that what he said.  Obama acts like he may or may not understand what he is saying; that is he acts like a dolt by playing a lot of golf and having parties at the White House. But most certainly he is not a stupid vain man, acting without purpose.  He's a smart, vain, purposeful man.  Satan's promise appeals to human vanity; \"you will be as God\" Gen.3:4).  That rappers are getting high in the White House reflect Obama's vanity primacy, and is very indicative that Obama does not care about the children his policy brings to the USA's southern border.  So he is also quite spiritually ill.\n\nThe Sate of Israel does fulfill biblical prophecy, irregardless of whether or not this government is secular.  And so satan and his government ministers (possibly sometimes even in Israel) are against that.  Satan said \"I will make myself like the most high\" [Isa.14:13-`4], and God said satan transfigures himself as an angel of light (2 Cor.11:14,15), so a lot of folks that are not -at all! - \"religious\" will become \"converted\" in the near future (Rev.13:3,4).\n\nObama to Netanyahu: I demand that Israel agree to a unilateral ceasefire and stop all offensive actions � especially air strikes.\n\n\n\n Americans are the ones who need to be most alarmed by what Obama�s actions on behalf of Hamas reveal about the general direction of American Middle East policy under his leadership.\n\n For the past five years, Americans from all quarters have concluded that the manifold failures of Obama�s Middle East policies � from Iraq to Iran, Libya, Afghanistan, Egypt, Syria, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and beyond � owe to a combination of Obama�s personal disinterest in foreign affairs and his presumed preference for withdrawal and isolationism over engagement.\n\n Obama himself has often encouraged this perception with his endless golf games and his talk about fighting �the war at home.�\n\n Obama�s open, public engagement in Hamas�s war against Israel shows that the popular assessment is wrong.\n\n Obama is as involved in the Middle East as all of his immediate predecessors were. He is personally leading US policy on every front. Kerry is not an independent actor.\n\n The problem is that in every war, in every conflict and in every contest of wills that has occurred in the Middle East since Obama took office, he has sided with Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood, against America�s allies.\n\n Under Obama, America has switched sides.\n\n\n\nmore of this Obama:\n\nThis should cause Obama and the UN great panic.\n\nThe UN is involved in this child abuse, housing Hamas missiles in UNRAW schools.\n\nFT buys into the Agenda 21 concept of controlling rural areas by regulation.\n\nOn the one hand, blaming the water loss on unregulated ground water use.\n\nMore than 75 per cent of the loss was due to the rapid depletion of groundwater from underground aquifers that many farmers depend on for irrigation,\n\nReality: In COLORADO, as in Colorado River, water has been very regulated since the 1800s.\n\nThe researchers found the rate of decline of groundwater, much of which is non-renewable and poorly managed, was roughly six times greater than the losses in Lake Mead and Lake Powell, another large reservoir further upstream on the Colorado River.\n\n\"further upstream\" - In other words, California and Las Vegas have always mismanaged water.\n\nAuthorities are spending more than $800m to tunnel under Lake Mead to maintain access to water because the stunted flow of the Colorado River means the lake has shrunk so much that two higher tunnels may no longer be able to channel water to Las Vegas and other cities.\n\nSo the cities, not the farmers are using the surface water. \n\n The rapid rates of groundwater depletion are likely to lead to further falls in Colorado River stream flows.\n\nSo the article contradicts itself here. \n\n The study�s authors say declines in the snowpack that feeds the river, and population growth, could threaten the long-term ability of the Colorado River Basin to to the seven basin states, which includes California, and to Mexico.\n\nThey are saying groundwater use is diminishing the flow of water into the Colorado River dam, and also saying that the groundwater use is occurring below dam, while calling for more restrictive use regulations above the dam.\n\nThis is a hit on rural - independent - lifestyles, and nothing more.\n\nU.S. Considering Refugee Status for Hondurans\n\nThey are assuming they will get released later.\n\nFor second time, rockets found at UN school in Gaza\n\nSo the UN gives them to Hamas.\n\nUS defends aid to UNRWA despite rocket caches\n\nSo the US gives money to UNRAW, which hides rockets for Hamas.\n\nFAA tells US airlines not to fly to Tel Aviv\n\nAn obvious attempt to get Israel to accept US ceasefire demands.\n\nTimed as US Sec. of State Kerry is flying in and out of Ben Gurion in yet another attempt to save Hamas.\n\nThe reality, in other words,  is that Israel must retake complete control of Gaza in order to keep the airport open.\n\nIsrael MUST fill the void left by removing Hamas...\n\nThis ban should be good for El-Al?\n\nFinally, Obama leads from the front: The Hamas-FAA move against Ben Gurion\n\nto think the ban was motivated by anything other than anti-Israel bias\n\nUN Vehicles being used to transport Hamas Terrorists\n\nIslamic jihadists have decimated the ancient Christian community in Iraq � and Barack Obama is upset with�Israel.\n\nAfter 2,000 Years, the Last Christian is Forced to Leave Mosul\n\nMosul is the area of Ninevah.  Baghdad is the area of Babylon (ancient physical city).\n\nBoth Assyria/Syria and Babylon are represented by a winged lion.\n\nISIS, or the Islamic State seems a likely candidate to be the Anti-Christ's empire, although the Kurdish kingdom is also viable.  Islam now controls the area of the Greek empire.\n\nFour Front War: First time in History Israel attacked from Lebanon, Syria, Gaza, Sinai\n\nVIDEO: Violent Muslims beat Jews with sticks at large pro-Israel rally in Los Angeles, DHS fires at wespon at attackers\n\nHere is the poison fruit of the cultural and political sanction of Islamic Jew-hatred and Islamic supremacism in Seattle\n\nJEWS DEPICTED AS EATING GENTILE BABIES AND DRINKING THEIR BLOOD.\n\nThe signs being waved and the chants hollered constituted a shocking public display of shameless Jew hatred right in the heart of Seattle.\n\nFor some strange reason Israel agrees to an Egyptian backed \"truce\" with Hamas, a terrorist organization.\n\nHamas didn't stop firing rockest, so Israel says they resume Op\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Hamas' rejection of the cease fire \"gives Israel full legitimacy to expand the operation to protect our people.\" \n\n \"We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarization of the (Gaza) Strip -

Is that clear? No one becomes Christian by him- or herself.\"\n\nThis follows Roman Catholic Church Doctrine. ( The RCC is Mystery Babylon)\n\nThis is not new, but interesting in light of Pappa Frenchy's earlier comments:\n\nPappa Frenchy: You don�t have to believe in God to go to heaven\n\nIt should be noted that many of the \"christians\" around the world that are being persecuted right now are Roman Catholics.\n\nThe RCC exists as Satan's false \"body/assembly of Christ\" (A.K.A. \"church\" which is Mystery Babylon - see Apologetics 22-25 by R.Mount) within the Thyatira assembly period.\n\nRevelation 2: 21 And I-gave to-her time in-order-that she-might-repent, and she-is not willing to-repent out-of her prostitution.\n\n v22 Behold I-am-casting her into a bed and the (ones) committing-adultery with her into great tribulation, if they-will not repent out-of her works;\n\n v23 And her children I-shall-kill in death; and all the assemblies will-come-to-know that I myself-am the (one) searching kidneys and hearts, and I-shall-give to-YOU to-each (one) according-to YOUR works.\n\nIslamists prove Jerusalem is not their holy site.\n\nAfter many, many rockets over many years, and after a long delay with the recent increase in rocket attacks, Israel decides to go after Hamas in Gaza.\n\nNoting ISIS is in Gaza and the west bank areas of Israel already - and ISIS is in Syria, and on the border of Jordan.\n\nIt seems Hamas has been allowed to be sort of a \"straw-man\" terrorist organization in Gaza.  That is, Israel has let them blather away and shoot missiles into fields and in return Hamas sort of keeps other Islamic terror groups from getting too close.  So with the approach of ISIS, Hamas has a choice, fight them or join them.  There is no money in making peace with Israel (obviously Hamas' best short and long term option) so they would likely join ISIS.  And ISIS presence recently documented among Hamas shows this to be the case.  So Israel has to \"go through\" Hamas in order to help Jordan.  (But of course Hezbollah (better trained than Hamas, may jump in, and Israel's intervention may be timed to stop that) So it seems likely that ISIS will also attack from the north border of Israel.  They will use Israel's policing of Hamas as fodder to call in help from Muslims around the world - a rallying cry from the new caliphate.  Beyond that, ISIS may still be a pawn of Iran and or Turkey...waiting for a war weakened Israel.\n\nWhen they say \"peace and safety\"\n\nIt is continually being called for, but it cannot yet be to be in effect.\n\n1 Thessalonians 5:3 \"At-the-time-that they-might-be- : peace and security, then sudden ruination is-standing-by-for-itself for-them as-altogether the birth-pain to-the (woman) having in womb, and they-might not flee-out.\"\n\nPeace is the only path to true security for Israel and the Palestinians\n\nThe United States has also demonstrated our commitment to Israel�s security through our enduring commitment to a lasting peace in the Middle East..... the United States will never give up on the hope of a lasting peace, which is the only path to true security for Israel.\n\nObama distinguishes Hezbollah�s and Hamas�s rockets, and finally laments the \"tragic\" deaths of Naftali Fraenkel, Gilad Shaar and Eyal Yifrach. Then he laments the \"senseless\" death of Mohammed HUSSEIN Abu Khdeir (perhaps noting a familiar connection). Then he equates the actions of the IDF with Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists in saying \", ALL PARTIES must protect the innocent and act with reasonableness and restraint, not vengeance and retribution\". \n\n \n\n Among the other lies, such as \"peace and security\" (see UN Charter's Preamble), at least part of one Obama statement here is true: \"Just as the Israeli people have the right to live in the historic homeland of the Jewish people, the Palestinian people deserve the right to self-determination\" . In other words, Jews have historic rights to the land of Israel and the \"Palestinians\" have the right to imagine/determine that they do. While it is not beneficial (Exd. 20:16) for the Palestinians to \"think whatever they want\" (i.e. make things up), but that is their prerogative. Unfortunately Obama considers that the figment of their fervent and fanatical imagination should be realized with a \"final solution\" of an Islamic state within the Jewish homeland.\n\n \n\n It is a blessing to have trust that God has great plans for ethnic Israel's greater fullness (Rom.11:12) in HIS land (Lev.25:23; Matt.6:10) even if we Christians cannot always fully comprehend how (Rom.11:33-36; 1Cor.13:12). \n\n\n\nAt the same time, Netanyahu is also calling for peace and security\n\nThe State of Israel is in the midst of a campaign for the restoration of to our citizens. \n\n \n\n Will not tolerate rocket fire on towns and iishobino, so I ordered a significant expansion of the IDF operation against Hamas and terrorists against the terrorists of other terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip. \n\n \n\n I did it only after all attempts to restore the peace, Hamas refused and opted for escalation. We battle, but confidence our citizens and our children first. Do whatever is necessary so that peace is prevailing here in recent years will continue. \n\n \n\n The IDF operation aimed against the terrorists of Hamas and against innocent civilians. While Hamas deliberately hiding behind civilians, and thus is liable when they get hurt accidentally. \n\n \n\n Citizens of Israel, I ask you to abide by provisions of the home front command, they save lives. I call you to learn patience, because this operation can take a while.\n\n \n\n In terms of terrorist organizations around the State of Israel are one front, and all citizens of the State of Israel are one thing. We must therefore stand together as one man � a cohesive, unified and safe in righteousness. \n\n \n\n We act decisively and firmly to restore peace in place and continue to operate until peace returns to our citizens and our children can live safely. (Translated by Bing)\n\nThere will be war until the presence of the Messiah...with a short time where they say they have \"peace and safety\".\n\nISIS Is About to Destroy Biblical History in Iraq\n\nIslam is idolatry.  This idolatrous worship system mimics God's theocracy even in the inclusion of idolatry.  In the eyes of the Islamist, the Christian is an idolater.  To say Satan controls Islam is similar to saying that Satan controls the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nHere's what God says Satan says:\n\nIsaiah 14:12  from heaven, O day-star (KJV has \"Lucifer\"), son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, that didst lay low the nations! \n\n 13 And thou saidst in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit upon the mount of congregation, in the uttermost parts of the north; \n\n 14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High. \n\n 15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to Sheol, to the uttermost parts of the pit.\n\nRevelation 12:9 And the dragon namely-the great (one) was-cast, the serpent namely-the ancient, the (one) being-called Devil and the satan, the (one) leading-astray the total inhabited-earth, he-was-cast into the earth, and his angels were-cast with him.\n\nOh, now there's a news flash.\n\nTip:  Those beheadings in Mexico are not a part of any Mexican or South American Culture.\n\nBut anyway, at least some remote fringe (remnant?) has the scoop:\n\n\"Yeah...Hezbollah is far better than Al-Qaeda.

But while their chaos strategy is brilliant in its way, it is also high risk. By its very nature, chaos is hard, if not impossible to control. Situations often get out of hand. Plans backfire.\n\n What we are seeing today in Syria and Iraq and the wider region demonstrates the chaos strategy�s drawbacks.\n\n As Pinchas Inbari detailed in a recent report for the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, the Syrian civil war is causing millions of Syrians to leave the country and their migrations are changing the face of many countries.\n\n For instance, their arrival in Lebanon has transformed the multi-ethnic state into one with a preponderant Sunni majority, thus watering down Hezbollah�s support base.\n\n The Kurds in Iraq may feel they need Turkey today, but there is no reason to assume that this will remain the case for long.\"\n\nNoting again that ISIS/ISIL is not a big military operation.  Ragtag, yes.

Those condemned, being handed over to the secular rulers of their bailiffs, let them be abandoned, to be punished with due justice, clerics being first degraded from their orders. As to the property of the condemned, if they are laymen, let it be confiscated; if clerics, let it be applied to the churches from which they received revenues. But those who are only suspected, due consideration being given to the nature of the suspicion and the character of the person, unless they prove their innocence by a proper defense, let them be anathematized and avoided by all 1-intil they have made suitable satisfaction; but if they have been under excommunication for one year, then let them be condemned as heretics. Secular authorities, whatever office they may hold, shall be admonished and induced and if necessary compelled by ecclesiastical censure, that as they wish to be esteemed and numbered among the faithful, so for the defense of the faith they ought publicly to take an oath that they will strive in good faith and to the best of their ability to in the territories subject to their jurisdiction all heretics pointed out by the Church ; so that whenever anyone shall have assumed authority, whether spiritual or temporal, let him be bound to confirm this decree by oath. But if a temporal ruler, after having been requested and admonished by the Church, should neglect to cleanse his territory of this heretical foulness, let him be excommunicated by the metropolitan and the other bishops of the province. If he refuses to make satisfaction within a year, let the matter be made known to the supreme pontiff, that he may declare the ruler's vassals absolved from their allegiance and may offer the territory to be ruled lay Catholics, who on the extermination of the heretics may possess it without hindrance and preserve it in the purity of faith; the right, however, of the chief ruler is to be respected as long as he offers no obstacle in this matter and permits freedom of action. The same law is to be observed in regard to those who have no chief rulers (that is, are independent). Catholics who have girded themselves with the cross for the extermination of the heretics, shall enjoy the indulgence s and privileges granted to those who go in defense of the Holy Land.\"\n\nApparently, this law/canon of exterminating those outside the Roman Church has never been rescinded.\n\nCome out from Mystery Babylon, the Roman Catholic Church, (Rev.18:4;

This is the same Israel that rejected Yeshua as Messiah; they were petrified, given a spirit of compunction, and their Passover seder was made to be always a snare, by YHVH (Rom.11:7-10). \"How much more their fulness\"(vs12), YES, but not until they accept Yeshua (Zech.12:10; Phil.2:9-11). We look forward to the third temple being built, but not as participants, for as believers, \"the sanctuary of the God is in you\" (1Cor.3:16). Of course at the return of Messiah, believers are made imperishable and immortal...so really, if you are trusting, no worries. I wonder if the third temple is destroyed by Messiah at Zech.14:4... \n\n \n\n A fascinating quote: \"The third temple will mostly look like the Second Temple, and there�s an organized plan for the Chamber of Hewn Stone, the seat of the Sanhedrin\" Isaiah 9:10a \"The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stone\". Note vs. 8 -\"Jacob\", indicating the 12 tribes, and vs. 9 \"The people\" - indicating the congregation of Israel.\n\n\n\nOther interesting statements from the article:\n\n�The Second Temple didn�t have an ark, either,�\n\n�The location of the altar where sacrifices are allowed on the Temple Mount is not within the bounds of Al-Aqsa,� he says, �so at least they should let us sacrifice on the Temple Mount.�\n\nThis allows for a \"covenant\", or agreement between Islam (8th world power) and Israel.\n\n\"The third temple will have cameras that will transmit what�s happening there to the whole world. The simulated sacrifice this Thursday can also be viewed online on the Temple Institute website. \n\n This shows how the two witnesses can be seen.\n\n200 BLM cops steal cattle from last rancher in S.

None of these exist even in the highest primates. Apes do not craft tools, marry, name their offspring, bury their dead, live by laws or customs, or respect inalienable rights. This radical uniqueness of human identity means that we do not have a �harmonious� relationship with nature, but an adversarial and conflicted one. The natural world is the alien, inhuman realm of blind force, indifferent to suffering, death, and beauty. It is meaningless, for only humans bestow meaning on the world. And that meaning reflects our knowledge that each of us is unique, a creature that appears only once, and that each of us must die.\n\n \n\n\n\nObama says his supporters are doing \"God's work\"\n\nIRS threatens: Obamacare Tax Must Be Paid with Tax Return\n\nTHIS IS SYRIA: Muslims Strangle A Young, Innocent Girl To Death..And The World Remains Silent\n\nA graphic video shows a girl being strangled to death in Syria for refusing to conform to extremist Islam beliefs.\n\nThis is Islamic Jihad training in the USA\n\nDo you think God does not work in your life?\n\nColorado lets the drug cartel operate free in exchange for cash\n\nDenver: A Mile High and then some.\n\nBanks won't touch the money because it's dirty.

He argued that Jesus made several implicit claims to divinity, which would logically exclude this:\n\n \n\n \"I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic � on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg � or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. \"\n\n \n\n Although widely repeated in Christian apologetic literature, it has been largely ignored by professional theologians and biblical scholars.\n\n \n\n Lewis on \"Natural Law\", which he also termed \"Moral law\":\n\n\"These then are the two points that I wanted to make. First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in\n\nLewis wrote what we now call \"The Chronicles of Narnia\".  \"Readers of his fiction are often unaware of what Lewis considered the Christian themes of his works.\"\n\nI'm not sold on the Chronicles of Narnia. But, as I recall, The Apostle Paul wrote something along the lines of \"whatever it takes, I'll do.\"\n\nFEMA says NO to Ocean Grove\n\nAre the \" local officials responsible for the unjust imprisonment and torture of four Protestant Christians\" of the Roman Catholic faith? \n\n \n\n\n\nObamacare is a flop designed to make the New and Improved Plan look good.\n\nand so now McCAIN flipflops and calls for repeal\n\nThe show must go on:\n\n\"Had enough of Obamacare ? Check out what common sense patient centered reform looks like:\"\n\n\"Simply repealing the President's health care law is not enough�it must be replaced\"\n\nand if this fails, Obamacare remains the \"safety net\" in which we are caught.\n\nA guess:  this (eventually) leads to Israel accepting Messianic Jews' aliyah requests - with the stipulation that they are subject to the Law of Moses.\n\nLower than 2012, which is now 3rd quietest tornado year in 23 years\n\n\"It's been a near-record quiet year, especially with respect to strong to violent tornadoes,\"\n\nOn average, tornadoes kill about 60 Americans each year.\n\n \n\n Tornadoes typically affect the U.S. more than any other nation.

            "text": "TEL AVIV - Israel resumed military action against Hamas Tuesday, giving up on an Egypt-brokered truce after Palestinian militants refused to join the deal and continued to fire rockets over the border.\n\nIsrael’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered airstrikes to resume after Hamas gave no indication it would accept the cease-fire.\n\nEarlier, Israel's security Cabinet had voted to approve the truce starting 9 a.m. local time (2 a.m. ET) after a meeting in Tel Aviv. However, air raids sirens sounded across southern Israel more than two hours after the truce came into effect as dozens of rockets were fired from Gaza.\n\n\"If Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet,\" Netanyahu told reporters.\n\nAt least seven Israeli airstrikes were later heard in the Gaza Strip.\n\nHamas’ armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, earlier said it had not been approached about any deal and that the terms, as reported in the media, amounted to a capitulation. The deal is “not worth the ink with which it was written,” it said in a statement posted on its website [link in Arabic].\n\n\"Our battle with the enemy is continuing and will grow even more intense,\" the statement added.\n\nMoussa Abu Marzouk, a top Hamas official who was in Cairo, said the movement had made no final decision. “We are still in consultation and there has been no official position made by the (Hamas) movement regarding the Egyptian proposal,'' he said, according to Reuters.\n\nHowever, Israel indicated that it would not wait any longer for Hamas to join the cease-fire. It said at least 50 rockets were fired from Gaza in the hours after the truce began.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry said he “cannot condemn strongly enough” the firing of rockets into Israel in the face of a crease-fire deal that had been agreed in “good faith.”\n\n“Israel has right to defend itself,” he told reporters in Vienna where he was attending nuclear talks with Iran. “Hamas should not use civilians as shields.”\n\nHe said he was prepared to fly to the region “if needed” but said Egypt “deserves time and space to make this work,” adding: “We urge all parties to support this ceasefire.”\n\nIsraeli television showed the Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepting several rockets over the port city of Ashdod. Israel’s military said three rockets landed in an open area near Ashkelon, causing no casualties. There was no immediate word of damage from the other rockets.\n\nIn the overnight hours prior to the truce, Israel bombed 25 sites in Gaza overnight. Palestinian medical officials said two people were killed — bringing the enclave's death toll to more than 182 in the recent action.\n\nRanna Khalil and Paul Goldman of NBC News and Reuters contributed to this report.

            "text": "Cabinet announces it accepts Egyptian cease-fire offer, while Hamas continues firing rockets at south, and as far as Zikhron Ya’akov, on the outskirts of Haifa. Hamas’s rejection of the cease fire “gives Israel full legitimacy to expand the operation to protect our people,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday, after dozens of rockets hit Israel after the 9am start of the Egyptian-offered truce. Israel’s cabinet voted in favor of the truce, while Hamas’ military wing rejected the proposal. “We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarization of the (Gaza) Strip – from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels – through diplomatic means,” he told reporters during an earlier press conference with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. “But if Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet.” Hamas rejected the Egyptian proposal, saying Cairo did not consult the group over the deal. The organization’s armed wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, rejected the offer completely, saying it was “a surrender” and “wasn’t worth the ink it was written with.” About an hour after the cabinet agreed to the truce, Code Red sirens sounded in Ashkelon and nearby regional councils. Two rockets landed outside a community in Eshkol, and were followed by additional barrages of rockets. Yisrael Beiteinu chairman, Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, voted against accepting the ceasefire proposal, as did Bayit Yehudi leader Naftali Bennett. Voting in favor of the offer were Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, Finance Minister Yair Lapid, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni and ministers Gilad Erdan and Yitzhak Aharonovich. Egyptian paper Al-Youm Al-Sabee purported to publish the details of the deal on Monday night. According to the report in Arabic, Israel will stop its aerial and naval attacks on Gaza, specifically refraining from any ground incursion into the Strip. Hamas for their part will rein in the Palestinian factions, and work to put an end to all types of attacks on Israel, including by rockets, sea or even underground tunnels; specifically attacks on civilians and the border region between Gaza and Israel. According to the report, the two sides also agreed to increase the flow of goods into Gaza, as well as the gradual opening of the crossings into Gaza, in return for calm. However, further details regarding security arrangements are still supposed to be discussed. “If the offer is what was reported, then this is surrender. We’ll intensity our fight against the enemy,” the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades said in a statement. Hamas spokesman Fauzi Barhum said that the Egyptian ceasefire offer was unacceptable. “A ceasefire without an agreement is out of the question. During a war, you don’t hold your fire and only then start negotiating,” he said. Hamas official Osama Hamdan added the Egyptian initiative was a “joke.” “We did not receive this declared paper from the Egyptians … which means it’s an initiative for the media. It’s not a political initiative,” he told CNN. The initiative was meant to “push the Palestinians into a corner and aid the Israelis.” However, Hamas didn’t close the door to negotiations on ending a week of fighting that killed at least 192 Palestinians and exposed millions of Israelis to rocket fire. The militant group appeared to be holding out for better cease-fire conditions, with senior officials saying the current proposal offers no tangible achievements, particularly on easing a border blockade of Gaza enforced by Israel and Egypt. Hamas also wants to be recognized by Egypt as a partner in any truce efforts. Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official in Gaza, said the movement was not consulted by Egypt. For more click LINK",

And communications are difficult with many senior officials in hiding during the Israeli air raids.\n\nSo establishing the group's definitive answer may take a little time, although we're clear on the views of military leaders inside the enclave that the Egyptian proposal is \"a surrender\".\n\nThe Palestinian militant group needs some sort of political win from this confrontation after all the suffering and destruction its people have gone through - the likeliest area of compromise would be some sort of easing of the tight economic restrictions on Gaza for which Israel and Egypt are jointly responsible.\n\nBut there's no guarantee of success for now.\n\nIsrael's security cabinet, convened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, approved the truce on Tuesday morning, minutes before the proposed time for it to come into effect.\n\n\"We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarisation of the [Gaza] Strip - from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels - through diplomatic means,\" Netanyahu told reporters.\n\nBut he added: \"If Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet.\"\n\nPeter Lerner, a spokesman for the IDF, Israel's military, said: \"In accordance with the government directives, the IDF now holds fire. We remain alert and preserve high preparedness levels, both defensive and offensive.\"\n\nThe BBC's Kevin Connolly says that Israel's rapid acceptance of the Egyptian ceasefire proposal is striking, and represents a smart tactical move.\n\nIf the deal holds then Israel will be happy with the outcome, our correspondent says - because it has damaged stockpiles of weapons that Hamas will find difficult to replenish, and it will have quiet on its border with Gaza.\n\nFor now, Hamas sources are saying its attacks will \"increase in ferocity and intensity\" unless Israel releases prisoners and co-operates with Egypt to lift economic restrictions on Gaza.\n\nThat is not encouraging but does not mean that a deal will not ultimately be done - just that it will not be easy, our correspondent says.\n\nMeanwhile the casualty figures continue to mount.\n\nThree people were killed in Khan Younis, south of Gaza, on Tuesday morning, shortly before Israel accepted the proposed truce.\n\nOf the 192 now reported dead by the Palestinian health authority, the UN estimates that over three-quarters were civilians.\n\nAn estimated 1,400 Palestinians have been injured.",

            "body": "bbc news mandelas mixed legacy for the middle east 6 december 2013 last updated at 0149 et mandelas mixed legacy for the middle east by kevin connolly bbc middle east correspondent jerusalem there was a genuine personal warmth between arafat and mandela according to a former palestinian official we may never see another life like nelson mandelas and so there may never be a death quite like his either the man who repaid persecution with patience and racism with reconciliation came to be seen as a kind of embodiment of our noblest instincts for making peace he chose the difficult path of forgiveness and togetherness when he could have been forgiven for choosing the way of bitterness and vengeance so its not surprising that in many places of division rival sides scramble to place their ties with mandela in the best possible light and to claim the legitimacy that confers nowhere more of course than in the middle east the truth is that mr mandela did not embroil himself much in the conflicts of others perhaps naturally wary of diluting his enormous moral authority by spreading himself too thinly around the worlds areas of conflict the middle east is one area though where we know quite a bit about mr mandelas connections and his thoughts and feelings mutual admiration the palestinians have the easiest case to make in claiming mr mandelas blessing for their cause during his long years in jail as an anc prisoner he was embraced by the plo leadership as a fellowfighter in a kind of global family of liberation movements muammar gaddafi of libya and cubas fidel castro also provided political and material support during the ancs long years in the wilderness mandela visited israel but was critical of its policies towards the palestinians mr mandela never forgot it either even when the political winds changed and he was a global superstar while some of his old allies found themselves on the losing side of history when yasser arafat died he called him an icon in the proper sense of the word he also said simply yasser arafat was one of the outstanding freedom fighters of his generation it is with great sadness that one notes that his and his peoples dream of a palestinian state had not been realised the former foreign minister of the palestinian authority nabil shaath who came to know nelson mandela personally said there was a genuine personal warmth between arafat and mandela that underlined the political link between them and he said palestinians had much to learn from the anc about maintaining the momentum of a global campaign through long years of struggle he told the bbc i think they waged the worlds bestever campaign to end apartheid and theres a lot to learn from that as well as the lesson of reconciliation advice to israel at a moment when anyone with a claim to a share in the mandela legacy is proud to make that connection israel has a painfully difficult case to make it was a close if secretive ally and arms supplier apartheid south africa and there is a good case to be made that israeli support helped the allwhite regime in pretoria to last longer than it otherwise might have continue reading the main story start quote i owe a debt of honour to the jews even if i have sometimes made restrained remarks about israel end quote nelson mandela there have been stories which are difficult to substantiate definitively that the cooperation extended into israel sharing nuclear weapons technology mr mandela observed sharply that when he was finally released from prison he received invitations to visit from almost every country in the world except israel when israel did begin issuing invitations as many as four in the course of the 1990s mr mandela was in no hurry to accept and its no coincidence that when he did come in 1999 it was at a moment when the then israeli prime minister ehud barak seemed close to a peace deal with the palestinians mr mandela must have hoped his presence might give some kind of final push it didnt as it turned out but mr mandela did spell out his attitude to the core of the problem when he went to the israeli foreign ministry he was quoted as saying talk of peace will remain hollow if israel continues to occupy arab territories i understand completely well why israel occupies these lands there was a war but if there is going to be peace there must be complete withdrawal from all of these areas new page there was no doubt that israels ties to the ugly apartheid regime left an impression on mr mandela but the israeli ambassador to south africa alon liel said a peace deal with the palestinians could have changed things he told us nelson mandela was furious about the cooperation and said we will never forget it but he said if you will change your attitude towards the palestinians we will open a new page with israel and mr mandela knew how to balance the personal with the political there was no doubt his heart lay with the palestinians as a people but he remembered fondly the many individual members of south africas jewish community who helped him in his hard early years there was the man who gave him his first job as a lawyer as well as arthur goldreich the white jewish anc activist who went undercover as a farmer to hide mr mandela when he was on the run at huge personal risk as mandela himself put it i owe a debt of honour to the jews even if i have sometimes made restrained remarks about israel at the time of his passing everyone will do what they can to claim something of his legacy the palestinians much more plausibly than the israelis but the outsider is left to reflect that the real tragedy is that this conflict is yet to create its own mandela with a moral personality so powerful that it might become a catalyst for lasting change",

            "text": "Israel yesterday resumed its airstrikes on Hamas-controlled Gaza, after Israel’s brief truce was met with ongoing rocket fire.\n\nIsrael had earlier accepted an Egyptian ceasefire proposal and halted operations in the morning. But the armed wing of Hamas rejected the initiative as a “surrender”.\n\nPalestinian officials said at least 193 people have been killed in eight days of Israeli airstrikes. Israel yesterday reported its first fatality, a 38-year-old man killed by a mortar shell fired from Gaza while he was delivering food to soldiers.\n\nPrime minister Benjamin Netanyahu last night said Israel had “no choice” but to step up its operations. He said: “Hamas chose to continue fighting and will pay the price for that decision. When there is no ceasefire, our answer is fire.”\n\nThe Israel Defence Force said 30 targets had been attacked in Gaza after airstrikes resumed.\n\nUnder the terms of the Egyptian initiative, the ceasefire should have been followed by a series of meetings in Cairo with high-level delegations from the two sides.\n\nBut Hamas dismissed the initiative, saying its battle with Israel would “increase in ferocity and intensity”.\n\nUS secretary of state John Kerry said he could not “condemn strongly enough” Hamas’ actions in continuing to fire rockets into Israel.\n\nMiddle East Quartet envoy Tony Blair said it was inevitable Israel would retaliate in the face of the continued rocket fire.\n\nHe said: “There’s no Israeli leader that would survive the day unless they were prepared to take action.”\n\nHamas believes it has little to lose by continuing to fight, while a truce on unfavourable terms could further weaken its grip on the Gaza Strip, a territory it seized in 2007 after battling rival Palestinian group Fatah.\n\nThe Egyptian plan asked both sides to halt hostilities without pre-conditions and then to try to negotiate a new border regime, easing the blockade of Gaza, with Cairo’s mediation.\n\nHamas wants a significant easing of the blockade, enforced by Israel and Egypt by varying degrees since 2007. Egypt tightened the closure over the past year by shutting smuggling tunnels that were crucial for Gaza’s economy, pushing Hamas into a severe financial crisis.\n\nSpeaking on Lebanese TV, Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas official, said: “The siege on Gaza must be broken and the people of Gaza should live freely like other people of the world.\n\n“There should be a new equation so that we will not have a war on Gaza every two years.”\n\nIsrael wants a deal that will ensure a halt to rocket fire from Gaza, but it is not clear what concessions it might be willing to make on the border closure.\n\nIsrael agreed to the Egyptian plan, proposed late on Monday, and for about six hours yesterday complied with an Egyptian call for de-escalation. But after the continued rocket fire from Gaza, Israel resumed airstrikes.\n\nAfter the renewed rocket fire from Gaza, Mr Netanyahu and Israeli defence minister Moshe Yaalon “directed the military to act with intensity against terror targets in Gaza,” an official said.\n\nA senior Israeli military official last night said that even though Israel resumed bombing Gaza, it would stop if Hamas accepts the truce and that the coming hours are critical. But if not, the military has a plan in place to significantly amp up its offensive, including a possible ground operation.\n\nIsrael has warned in the past that it might launch a ground offensive in Gaza and has amassed thousands of troops on the border. However, entering Gaza would probably increase casualties on both sides. Israel has often hesitated in the past to embark on ground operations for fear of getting entangled in the densely populated territory of 1.7 million.\n\nThe fighting, which began on 8 July, has been the deadliest since a major Israeli military offensive in the winter of 2008-9.\n\nThe most recent outbreak of cross-border violence, in 2012, eventually ended with the help of Egypt.",

Hamas — which is part of the Palestinian government — and Israel are engaged in what is being called one of the worst flare-ups in this region for years.\n\nSo what started it this time? It began with the abduction of Israeli teens and the subsequent finding of their bodies. Then a Palestinian teen was found dead. The violence escalated from there. The latest news on the conflict saw Hamas rejecting Egypt’s potential peace plan (which Israel agreed to) and firing rockets into Israel, killing an Israeli man. Israel’s response: fire rockets right back. As Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “Hamas chose to continue fighting and will pay the price for that decision. When there is no ceasefire, our answer is fire.”Israel’s next step is reportedly to target Hamas’ political leader with further air strikes.\n\nThe Bible refers to Israel as “the promised land,” God’s chosen nation. But painting Israel as the victim would be naive. There is no good guy or bad guy. There is only violence, and victims on both sides. People are dying everywhere, and we can’t afford to be ignorant of what is happening on our planet.",

But hospital director Basman Ashi said everyone was staying put and foreign volunteers had arrived to serve as human shields. The Egyptian proposal, initially accepted by Israel, had been the first attempt to end the fighting. But it unravelled in less than a day, a sign that it will be harder than before to reach a truce. Hamas does not consider Egypt's current rulers, who deposed a Hamas-friendly government in Cairo a year ago, to be fair brokers and violence is bound to escalate in the coming days. Hamas believes it has little to lose by continuing to fight, while a truce on unfavorable terms could further weaken its grip on the Gaza Strip, a territory it seized in 2007. Underscoring that position, Gaza militants fired more than 120 rockets and mortar rounds at Israel on Tuesday during what Egypt had hoped would be a period of de-escalation. An Israeli man in his 30s was killed near the Gaza border as he delivered food to soldiers. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after Hamas' rejection of the ceasefire, Israel had \"no choice\" but to respond more forcefully. In a TV address, he said: \"Hamas chose to continue fighting and will pay the price for that decision. When there is no ceasefire, our answer is fire.\" Mr Netanyahu said Israel would have liked to have seen a diplomatic solution.",

gaza and egypt ending the siege on gaza extending the fishing zone off the gaza coast currently set at three miles despite a 2012 agreement to double it pay the salaries of 40000 hamas employees of

border crossings and facilitate the passage of persons and goods — once the security situation becomes stable on the ground its not clear a cessation of rocket fire alone would qualify as stabilizing the security situation the egyptian proposal also does nothing to address hamas concerns about its reconciliation with abbass fatah party ending a sevenyear split just after the two factions agreed to a new government in early june clashes broke out in gaza when abbas refused to pay overdue salaries for hamas employees and abbas angered hamas by insisting on continued security cooperation with israel in the west bank even as israeli security forces arrested about 400 hamas members in connection after the kidnapping and murder of three israeli teens why israel and egypt have teamed up both israel and egypt have a strong interest in weakening hamas which they see as a terrorist offshoot of the nowbanned muslim brotherhood the ceasefire reportedly the result of direct coordination combines their considerable power to force hamas even farther into the corner such an effort wouldnt have been possible during the november 2012 conflict back then egypt was led by president mohamed morsi of the muslim brotherhood and hamas was riding the tide of rising islamist fortunes from tunisia to egypt to turkey the smuggling tunnels between egypt and israel became a virtual highway as one israeli official described it enabling hamas to bolster its supplies of weaponry and fuel its rocket factories but after egypts military chief abdel fattah alsisi ousted mr morsi a year ago mr sisi cracked down hard on the tunnels destroying an estimated 90 percent of them and cutting off hamass main artery for commercial goods military supplies and government revenue now sisi is wielding his power as president to weaken hamas so far hamas is pushing back but its ability to leverage the conflict for its own interests appears dubious at best the us has condemned hamas actions following israels acceptance of the truce i can not condemn strongly enough the actions of hamas in so brazenly firing rockets in multiple numbers in the face of a goodwill effort to secure a ceasefire us secretary of state john kerry told reporters in vienna he added that currently there is potential of an even greater escalation of violence as israel has the right to defend itself at least 196 people — most of them civilians — have died as a result of air strikes since israels operation protective edge began on tuesday july 8 the outbreak of violence follows the kidnappings and killings of three israeli teenagers in the west bank and the kidnapping and killing of a palestinian teenager in an apparent revenge attack the offensive is the heaviest fighting since a similar eightday campaign in november 2012 to stop gaza rocket fire peace between israel and its neighbors remains a long shot but it has no chance as long as hamas is seen as a strong and quasilegitimate political player",

            "text": "Israel’s military resumed operation Operation Protective Edge against Hamas in Gaza, six hours after accepting an Egyptian cease-fire proposal.\n\nThe resumption of operations in Gaza was announced at about 3 p.m. on Tuesday (July 15), after more than 40 rockets were fired from Gaza at southern, central and northern Israel in the hours after Israel halted attacks in observance of the cease-fire.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned earlier Tuesday that he would order the intensification of operation against Hamas if it continued to fire rockets at Israeli civilians.\n\nLate on Monday, Egypt proposed a truce between Israel and Hamas by establishing a 12-hour ceasefire at 06:00 GMT and launching negotiations in Cairo.\n\nIsrael announced it would agree to an Egyptian-backed ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the security cabinet has stated. However, the peace plan looks in ruins, with Hamas rejecting the initiative.\n\nSami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official rejected the proposal because it was deemed to be unacceptable. Previously, the al-Qassam Brigades had shown little interest in getting to the negotiation table.\n\nIsrael sees in the Egyptian-proposed Gaza truce an opportunity to strip the Palestinian enclave of rockets but is prepared to redouble military action there if the cross-border launches persist, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday.\n\nPalestinian militants in the Gaza Strip fired rockets at Israel on Tuesday (July 15) after the Israeli government accepted, and Hamas Islamists said they rejected, an Egyptian-proposed ceasefire.\n\nLive television showed the Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepting several rockets over the port city of Ashdod and sirens sounded in other parts of southern Israel.\n\nChannel Two TV said 10 rockets had been launched. The Israeli military, which said it had stopped its attacks in Gaza, reported before the Ashdod strike that three rockets had been fired since the ceasefire deal was to have gone into effect.\n\nThe outbreak of violence follows the kidnappings and killings of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, and the kidnapping and killing of a Palestinian teenager in an apparent revenge attack.\n\nThe offensive is the heaviest fighting since a similar eight-day campaign in November 2012 to stop Gaza rocket fire.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday morning, three rockets were fired from Egypt towards the southern Israeli resort of Eilat. Four civilians were injured, according to Israeli security officials. They added that they believed the rockets were fired by Islamist militants in the Egyptian Sinai in an attempt to derail Cairo’s efforts to mediate a truce between Israel and Palestine and put an end to the week-long shelling of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn response to the Egyptian proposal, Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said on Monday that his movement would not accept any truce that excludes the conditions of the Palestinian groups and people, as quoted by Israeli media.\n\nIn a televised address, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh praised the role of Hamas fighters and denounced the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip.\n\nHamas seeks more than an end to strikes, according to numerous sources, including Israeli negotiator Gershon Baskin, who helped establish a backchannel with Hamas in 2011. Those discussions led to the 2011 release of kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe Egyptian cease-fire only touches on the second and third points, without any clear promises.\n\nThe text of the proposal includes only a vague proposition to open the border crossings and “facilitate” the passage of persons and goods — “once the security situation becomes stable on the ground.” It’s not clear a cessation of rocket fire alone would qualify as stabilizing the security situation.\n\nThe Egyptian proposal also does nothing to address Hamas concerns about its reconciliation with Abbas’s Fatah party, ending a seven-year split. Just after the two factions agreed to a new government in early June, clashes broke out in Gaza when Abbas refused to pay overdue salaries for Hamas employees. And Abbas angered Hamas by insisting on continued security cooperation with Israel in the West Bank, even as Israeli security forces arrested about 400 Hamas members in connection after the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teens.\n\nBoth Israel and Egypt have a strong interest in weakening Hamas, which they see as a terrorist offshoot of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood. The cease-fire, reportedly the result of direct coordination, combines their considerable power to force Hamas even farther into the corner.\n\nSuch an effort wouldn’t have been possible during the November 2012 conflict. Back then, Egypt was led by President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Hamas was riding the tide of rising Islamist fortunes from Tunisia to Egypt to Turkey. The smuggling tunnels between Egypt and Israel became a virtual “highway,” as one Israeli official described it, enabling Hamas to bolster its supplies of weaponry and fuel its rocket factories.\n\nBut after Egypt’s military chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ousted Mr. Morsi a year ago, Mr. Sisi cracked down hard on the tunnels, destroying an estimated 90 percent of them and cutting off Hamas’s main artery for commercial goods, military supplies, and government revenue.\n\nNow, Sisi is wielding his power as president to weaken Hamas. So far, Hamas is pushing back, but its ability to leverage the conflict for its own interests appears dubious at best.\n\nAt least 196 people — most of them civilians — have died as a result of air strikes since Israel’s Operation Protective Edge began on Tuesday (July 8)\n\nThe outbreak of violence follows the kidnappings and killings of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, and the kidnapping and killing of a Palestinian teenager in an apparent revenge attack.\n\nThe offensive is the heaviest fighting since a similar eight-day campaign in November 2012 to stop Gaza rocket fire.",

            "text": "Palestinian health officials say 204 people are now dead in Gaza as a result of Israeli airstrikes. Israel says its defending itself against Hamas rocket attacks, and one person has died there so far.\n\nOvernight, tens of thousands of people in northern and eastern Gaza were warned to leave their homes amid warnings that the campaign would intensify.\n\nIsrael's military has urged tens of thousands of Palestinians living in northern and eastern Gaza to leave their homes.\n\nThe move could signal more airstrikes are planned for those areas after Israel warned the ruling Hamas militant group would \"pay the price\" for rejecting a ceasefire plan.\n\nIsrael says it will \"expand and intensify\" its offensive as aerial assaults resumed on Tuesday after being briefly suspended following its acceptance of the Egypt-brokered truce.\n\nPalestinian militants fired dozens of rockets in the first six hours of the ceasefire plan which led to Israel restarting its strikes in Gaza - that has a population of 1.7 million.\n\nThe fresh raids hit Gaza City, southern Khan Younis, Rafah and central Johr al Deeq, killing five people, reported the AFP news agency.\n\nIsrael has confirmed its first death of the week-long conflict - a man who was delivering food to soldiers suffered fatal wounds when a Hamas rocket struck the Erez crossing on the Gaza border.\n\nThe Israeli military has told residents of the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya and the Gaza City neighbourhoods of Shijaiyah and Zeitoun in automated telephone calls to leave their properties.\n\nSami Wadiya, a resident of one of the areas likely to be targeted, said he would not leave his home. \"We know it's risky, but there are no secure places to go to\".\n\nPrior to the calls, the raids have already prompted around 17,000 people to flee their homes, particularly in northern Gaza, with many taking refuge in UN schools.\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has declared an emergency in all five areas of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIt says that the situation on the ground over the past 24 hours has remained intense.\n\n\"Close to 18,000 women, men and children spent the night in 21 UNRWA designated emergency shelters. Approximately 10,800 people have taken shelter in 16 UNRWA schools in Gaza City and about 7,000 in 5 shelters in northern Gaza\" it adds.\n\nHamas officials said they had not been consulted on the ceasefire proposal and would not halt violence without a fully-fledged deal including Israeli concessions.\n\nMore than 190 Palestinians, including many civilians - some children - have been killed by the bombardment over the last week and the Israelis say the raids are designed to stop rocket fire from Gaza.\n\nSince July 8th, Gaza militants have fired more than 1,200 rockets at Israel - hundreds of which have been intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system - while Israeli aircraft have struck close to 1,700 times.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said \"It would have been preferable to have solved this diplomatically, and this is what we tried to do when we accepted the Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire\".\n\n\"But Hamas leaves us no choice but to expand and intensify the campaign against it\".\n\nHe added \"Hamas chose to continue fighting and will pay the price for that decision. When there is no ceasefire, our answer is fire\".\n\nHamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the movement had not been consulted on the truce bid.\n\n\"We didn't get to see the Egyptian proposal except through the media\" he said.\n\n\"The idea of halting fire before there is any agreement on the conditions laid out by the resistance is unacceptable and we reject it\".\n\nHamas has said it wants the end of Israel's blockade of Gaza and the opening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt as part of a truce deal. It also wants Israel to free Palestinians it re-arrested after releasing them in a 2011 exchange for an Israeli soldier held by Gaza militants for more than five years.\n\nKim Sengupta from the London Independent is in Gaza. He told Newstalk Breakfast that there was confusion amongst officials there about the proposed ceasefire that failed yesterday.",

            "body": "gaza negotiations plagued by badfaith actors al jazeera america after palestinian president mahmoud abbas toohasty embrace of the egyptian ceasefire proposal and corresponding criticism of hamas the popular narrative of the ongoing crisis in gaza is that hamas has betrayed the truce agreement despite israels hourslong unilateral compliance on the contrary hamas didnt violate the ceasefire because it never signed onto it in fact it has from the outset rejected any such reprieve prior to negotiating the terms of an armistice with israel yet despite its clear position hamas was not consulted in the formation of egypts proposal — in fact it claims to have found out about it through media reports the proposal put forward by the egyptians was not a serious attempt to bring the conflict to a resolution — it will exacerbate the crisis as it was likely designed to do egypts current president abdel fattah el sisi shares israels desire to destroy hamas — an offshoot of the muslim brotherhood which sisi perhaps rightly views as an existential threat to his nascent regime both groups are banned in egypt under sisis orders he jailed his predecessor on trumpedup charges of colluding with hamas he indefinitely closed the rafah crossing into egypt — gazas only connection to the outside world given israels illegal land and sea blockade — in an attempt to choke off hamas and weaken its position among gazans he subsequently destroyed the tunnels used by hamas to smuggle assets into gaza circumventing the crossing he is even courting a joint missiledefense system with israel in order to help contain the group and its patron iran as part of a growing security partnership between the two countries all of these measures have fed and continue to feed into the baseless racebaiting conspiracies resonating across the arab world and beyond that sisi is jewish and a manchurian candidate for israel and its zionist hardliners this impression is further exacerbated by israels quiet but persistent support for sisis deposing of mohamed morsi as well as his personal rise to power and subsequent brutal crackdown on hamas and the muslim brotherhood accordingly sisi was and remains a radically inappropriate choice as a mediator between hamas and israel notwithstanding egypts traditional role in easing tensions between the two parties as the situation in gaza deteriorated sisi sat on his hands for a week likely savoring israels attempts at breaking hamas and then despite it being easily within his power to do so he refused to give hamas any kind of an out in his proposal anything it could take back to its constituents as a victory rather he put forward a proposal destined likely intended to fail and only under pressure from the arab world and the west to put on a show of doing something the united states suffers from a similar conflict of interest preventing it from serving as a mediator between hamas and israel america has refused to recognize hamas government as legitimate from the time it rose to power in 2006 until the formation of its unity government last month instead the george w bush administration passed economic sanctions punishing gazans for the hamasled governments failure to agree to israels terms for forming such a government and plotted to overthrow hamas unsuccessfully in collaboration with fatah the obama administration has blocked un initiatives to recognize palestine as a state despite overwhelming international support — vigorously and unsuccessfully opposing palestinians gaining even an observer status in the united nations and it uses its position on the security council to nullify any meaningful sanctions or interventions against israel despite repeated and unapologetic defiance of international rules and norms simultaneously the obama administration is going out of its way to mend fences with israel following its revelation that israels continued settlement building was the primary cause of the recent peace talks failure as well as secretary of state john kerrys quickly retracted warning that israel risks becoming an apartheid state if it does not manage to achieve a twostate solution and the administrations longoverdue recognition of the palestinian unity government despite the important role hamas plays in that body as a result of these moves each of which outraged the israelis much like the nuclear negotiations with iran the united states is in no position to leverage israel into goodfaith negotiations in fact while encouraging restraint the administration has been falling all over itself to recognize israels right to selfdefense — a right that has never been extended to palestinians under any circumstances in fact since the outbreak of the conflict the us senate has voted to double israels funding for its iron dome missile defense system also conspicuously absent is the usual handwringing and saberrattling from us regional allies this is because like egypt saudi arabia the uae and jordan are in the process of extending israels iron dome and arrow systems across their territories as well in a usbrokered joint missile defense initiative aimed at containing iran and its regional allies such as hamas and hezbollah before long all of these powers may actually be helping to shoot down rockets on israels behalf — be they from iran syria iraq lebanon or gaza even turkey is likely to play an indirect role in this new system — collecting and sharing information with nato to be dispersed among nato partners principally the united states nonetheless israel is unlikely to negotiate with turkey for an end to the crisis this leaves qatar as probably the only regional power with the proper clout and independence to broker a deal in the meantime egypts badfaith proposal has served as a public relations coup for israel it changes the narrative and muddies the guilt now it isnt israel that is responding with radically inappropriate force to a nonthreat over the last decade only 24 israeli civilians have been killed by palestinian rockets —hardly an existential crisis an occupying power preposterously claiming selfdefense — but instead the story is increasingly that hamas is being unreasonable despite israel having stopped its attacks for six hours hamas continued its offensive forcing israel to retaliate — especially as it has suffered its first fatality in this most recent unrest as compared with nearly 200 dead on the palestinian side with more than 1000 injured tens of thousands displaced untold numbers traumatized and critical infrastructure destroyed israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu was up front about his intention to leverage sisis proposal to justify expanding and intensifying

            "text": "Accordingly, Sisi was and remains a radically inappropriate choice as a mediator between Hamas and Israel, notwithstanding Egypt’s traditional role in easing tensions between the two parties. As the situation in Gaza deteriorated, Sisi sat on his hands for a week, likely savoring Israel’s attempts at breaking Hamas. And then, despite it being easily within his power to do so, he refused to give Hamas any kind of an out in his proposal, anything it could take back to its constituents as a victory. Rather, he put forward a proposal destined, likely intended, to fail , and only under pressure from the Arab world and the West to put on a show of “doing something.”\n\nAll of these measures have fed, and continue to feed, into the baseless race-baiting conspiracies resonating across the Arab world (and beyond) that Sisi is Jewish and a Manchurian candidate for Israel and its Zionist hard-liners. This impression is further exacerbated by Israel’s quiet but persistent support for Sisi’s deposing of Mohamed Morsi, as well as his personal rise to power and subsequent brutal crackdown on Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nEgypt’s current president, Abdel Fattah El Sisi, shares Israel’s desire to destroy Hamas — an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which Sisi perhaps rightly views as an existential threat to his nascent regime ; both groups are banned in Egypt under Sisi’s orders. He jailed his predecessor on trumped-up charges of colluding with Hamas. He indefinitely closed the Rafah crossing into Egypt — Gaza’s only connection to the outside world, given Israel’s illegal land and sea blockade  — in an attempt to choke off Hamas and weaken its position among Gazans. He subsequently destroyed the tunnels used by Hamas to smuggle assets into Gaza circumventing the crossing. He is even courting a joint missile-defense system with Israel in order to help contain the group and its patron, Iran, as part of a growing security partnership between the two countries.\n\nAfter Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’ too-hasty embrace of the Egyptian cease-fire proposal and corresponding criticism of Hamas , the popular narrative of the ongoing crisis in Gaza is that Hamas has betrayed the truce agreement despite Israel’s hours-long unilateral compliance . On the contrary, Hamas didn’t violate the cease-fire because it never signed onto it. In fact, it has from the outset rejected any such reprieve prior to negotiating the terms of an armistice with Israel. Yet despite its clear position, Hamas was not consulted in the formation of Egypt’s proposal — in fact, it claims to have found out about it through media reports . The proposal put forward by the Egyptians was not a serious attempt to bring the conflict to a resolution — it will exacerbate the crisis, as it was likely designed to do.\n\nThe United States suffers from a similar conflict of interest preventing it from serving as a mediator between Hamas and Israel: America has refused to recognize Hamas’ government as legitimate from the time it rose to power in 2006 until the formation of its unity government last month. Instead, the George W. Bush administration passed economic sanctions punishing Gazans for the Hamas-led government’s failure to agree to Israel’s terms for forming such a government and plotted to overthrow Hamas (unsuccessfully) in collaboration with Fatah. The Obama administration has blocked U.N. initiatives to recognize Palestine as a state despite overwhelming international support — vigorously (and unsuccessfully) opposing Palestinians gaining even an observer status in the United Nations. And it uses its position on the Security Council to nullify any meaningful sanctions or interventions against Israel, despite repeated and unapologetic defiance of international rules and norms.\n\nSimultaneously, the Obama administration is going out of its way to mend fences with Israel following its revelation that Israel’s continued settlement building was the primary cause of the recent peace talks’ failure, as well as Secretary of State John Kerry’s (quickly retracted) warning that Israel risks becoming an apartheid state if it does not manage to achieve a two-state solution, and the administration’s long-overdue recognition of the Palestinian unity government despite the important role Hamas plays in that body.\n\nAs a result of these moves, each of which outraged the Israelis (much like the nuclear negotiations with Iran), the United States is in no position to leverage Israel into good-faith negotiations. In fact, while encouraging restraint, the administration has been falling all over itself to recognize Israel’s right to self-defense — a right that has never been extended to Palestinians under any circumstances. In fact, since the outbreak of the conflict the U.S. Senate has voted to double Israel’s funding for its “Iron Dome” missile defense system.\n\nAlso conspicuously absent is the usual hand-wringing and saber-rattling from U.S. regional allies. This is because, like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan are in the process of extending Israel’s Iron Dome and Arrow systems across their territories as well, in a U.S.-brokered joint missile defense initiative aimed at containing Iran and its regional allies, such as Hamas and Hezbollah. Before long, all of these powers may actually be helping to shoot down rockets on Israel’s behalf — be they from Iran, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon or Gaza. Even Turkey is likely to play an indirect role in this new system — collecting and sharing information with NATO, to be dispersed among NATO partners, principally the United States. Nonetheless, Israel is unlikely to negotiate with Turkey for an end to the crisis. This leaves Qatar as probably the only regional power with the proper clout and independence to broker a deal.\n\nIn the meantime, Egypt’s bad-faith proposal has served as a public relations coup for Israel. It changes the narrative and muddies the guilt: Now it isn’t Israel that is responding with radically inappropriate force to a non-threat (over the last decade, only 24 Israeli civilians have been killed by Palestinian rockets —hardly an existential crisis), an occupying power preposterously claiming self-defense — but instead the story is increasingly that Hamas is being unreasonable. Despite Israel having stopped its attacks for six hours, Hamas continued its offensive, forcing Israel to retaliate — especially as it has suffered its first fatality in this most recent unrest (as compared with nearly 200 dead on the Palestinian side, with more than 1,000 injured, tens of thousands displaced, untold numbers traumatized and critical infrastructure destroyed).\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was up front about his intention to leverage Sisi’s proposal to justify expanding and intensifying Israel’s campaign into Gaza, insisting, \"If Hamas does not accept the cease-fire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet.”\n\nFor his part, unity government notwithstanding, Abbas appears to be working with Egypt and Israel in yet another bid to alienate Hamas and expand his own influence in Gaza by proposing that the Rafah crossing be reopened — albeit manned by his loyalist forces. This is a proposal that Egypt and Israel are likely to welcome but Hamas will be naturally inclined to reject. It is likely that Israel will ramp up operations in the lead-up to this proposal, increasing the desperation of Gazans in order to render the deal more difficult for Hamas to refuse — a maneuver sure to backfire, as it always does, perpetuating ­ad infinitum the omnidirectional war of attrition that has defined the region for decades now, in which the only real losers are the Palestinian people.",

            "text": "Israel has accepted an Egyptian truce proposal for the conflict with Gaza.\n\nHamas, which controls Gaza, is still discussing the plan, but its armed wing has rejected it as a \"surrender\".\n\nUnder the terms, the ceasefire should begin immediately, followed by a series of meetings in Cairo with high-level delegations from both sides.\n\nPalestinian officials say at least 192 people have been killed by Israeli air strikes launched eight days ago to stop militants firing rockets into Israel.\n\nThere have been no Israeli air strikes into Gaza since the 09:00 ( 06:00 GMT) truce, but Israel says 39 rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel after the deadline.\n\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry said he could not \"condemn strongly enough\" Hamas' actions in continuing to fire rockets despite the ceasefire call.\n\nIf Hamas continues to reject the deal, then the Israelis will feel they emerge from the breakdown holding the diplomatic high ground.\n\nNo-one can be sure what's happening behind the scenes between Hamas and Egypt.\n\nHamas has both political and military wings - and some leaders who are not in Gaza. And communications are difficult with many senior officials in hiding during the Israeli air raids.\n\nSo establishing the group's definitive answer may take a little time, although we're clear on the views of military leaders inside the enclave that the Egyptian proposal is \"a surrender\".\n\nThe Palestinian militant group needs some sort of political win from this confrontation after all the suffering and destruction its people have gone through - the likeliest area of compromise would be some sort of easing of the tight economic restrictions on Gaza for which Israel and Egypt are jointly responsible.\n\nBut there's no guarantee of success for now.\n\nIsrael's security cabinet, convened by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, approved the truce on Tuesday morning, minutes before the proposed time for it to come into effect.\n\n\"We agreed to the Egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarisation of the [Gaza] Strip - from missiles, from rockets and from tunnels - through diplomatic means,\" Mr Netanyahu told reporters.\n\nBut he added: \"If Hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal, as would now seem to be the case, Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet.\"\n\nPeter Lerner, a spokesman for the IDF, Israel's military, said: \"In accordance with the government directives, the IDF now holds fire. We remain alert and preserve high preparedness levels, both defensive and offensive.\"\n\nThe BBC's Kevin Connolly says that Israel's rapid acceptance of the Egyptian ceasefire proposal is striking, and represents a smart tactical move.\n\nIf the deal holds then Israel will be happy with the outcome, our correspondent says - because it has damaged stockpiles of weapons that Hamas will find difficult to replenish, and it will have quiet on its border with Gaza.\n\nFor now, Hamas sources are saying its attacks will \"increase in ferocity and intensity\" unless Israel releases prisoners and co-operates with Egypt to lift economic restrictions on Gaza.\n\nThat is not encouraging but does not mean that a deal will not ultimately be done - just that it will not be easy, our correspondent says.\n\nMeanwhile the casualty figures continue to mount.\n\nThree people were killed in Khan Younis, south of Gaza, on Tuesday morning, shortly before Israel accepted the proposed truce.\n\nOf the 192 now reported dead by the Palestinian health authority, the UN estimates that over three-quarters were civilians.\n\nAn estimated 1,400 Palestinians have been injured.\n\nIsrael disputes the Palestinian casualty figures, saying they were based on Hamas sources and were not objective.\n\nAt least four Israelis have been seriously injured since the violence flared, but none have been killed.\n\nIsraeli sources said at least three rockets landed in and around the southern Israeli city of Eilat overnight.\n\nReports suggest they may have been fired from the Sinai peninsula in Egypt rather than from Gaza.\n\nAre you in the area?

affair unbeknown to the home secretary the evidence had come from phone hacking mr blunkett resigned as home secretary in 2004 following unproven allegations about fast tracking a visa it became very

            "text": "Israel's military has urged tens of thousands of Palestinians living in northern and eastern Gaza to leave their homes.The move could signal more airstrikes are planned for those areas after Israel warned the ruling Hamas militant group would \"pay the price\" for rejecting a ceasefire plan.Israel says it will \"expand and intensify\" its offensive as aerial assaults resumed on Tuesday after being briefly suspended following its acceptance of the Egypt-brokered truce.Palestinian militants fired dozens of rockets in the first six hours of the ceasefire plan which led to Israel restarting its strikes in Gaza - that has a population of 1.7 million.The fresh raids hit Gaza City, southern Khan Younis, Rafah and central Johr al Deeq, killing five people, reported the AFP news agency.Israel has confirmed its first death of the week-long conflict - a man who was delivering food to soldiers suffered fatal wounds when a Hamas rocket struck the Erez crossing on the Gaza border.The Israeli military has told residents of the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya and the Gaza City neighbourhoods of Shijaiyah and Zeitoun in automated telephone calls to leave their properties.Sami Wadiya, a resident of one of the areas likely to be targeted, said he would not leave his home. \"We know it's risky, but there are no secure places to go to.\"Prior to the calls, the raids have already prompted around 17,000 people to flee their homes, particularly in northern Gaza, with many taking refuge in UN schools.Hamas officials said they had not been consulted on the ceasefire proposal and would not halt violence without a fully-fledged deal including Israeli concessions.More than 190 Palestinians, including many civilians - some children - have been killed by the bombardment over the last week and the Israelis say the raids are designed to stop rocket fire from Gaza.Since July 8, Gaza militants have fired more than 1,200 rockets at Israel - hundreds of which have been intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system - while Israeli aircraft have struck close to 1,700 times.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"It would have been preferable to have solved this diplomatically, and this is what we tried to do when we accepted the Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire.\"But Hamas leaves us no choice but to expand and intensify the campaign against it.\"He added: \"Hamas chose to continue fighting and will pay the price for that decision. When there is no ceasefire, our answer is fire.\"Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the movement had not been consulted on the truce bid.\"We didn't get to see the Egyptian proposal except through the media,\" he said.\"The idea of halting fire before there is any agreement on the conditions laid out by the resistance is unacceptable and we reject it.\"Hamas has said it wants the end of Israel's blockade of Gaza and the opening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt as part of a truce deal.It also wants Israel to free Palestinians it re-arrested after releasing them in a 2011 exchange for an Israeli soldier held by Gaza militants for more than five years.",

Poor Apartheid Israeli being rocket bombed by nasty Hamas. For those more intelligent, the breakdown of the recent butchery is far more complex...\n\nthree Jewish teenagers, Naftali Fraenkel, Gilad Shaer and Eyal Yifrah were kidnapped on 12th June. Israel blamed Hamas, Hamas were adamant that they had nothing to do with it. The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) responded with a huge manhunt called Operation Brother’s Keeper that created a large amount of destruction in the areas searched and resulted in the arrest of 350 Palestinians and the deaths of 5. Israel’s over the top response to the 3 teenagers has helped generate this backlash and that is often overlooked in any of the current coverage, once the 3 boys were found dead, there was a copy cat kidnapping and murder of 3 Palestinian teenagers.\n\n…so the birth of this latest terrible violence is Apartheid Israel’s usual aggressive over reaction to the symptoms that erupt from their illegal occupation of Palestine. To date we now have over 170 Palestinians dead, 1100  Palestinians injured and thousands forced from their homes. Israel has suffered one death. That’s not an eye for an eye, it’s an eye for an eye, most of the chin and half the  face.\n\nSo when will a NZ Political Party show some actual ethics on this issue and demand the Apartheid Israel Embassy be closed down and expelled from Wellington? Helen Clark had the courage to kick Israel out of NZ over their spys trying to steal our passports, but of course the gutless National Party quickly let Israel back into NZ.\n\nNational’s spineless acquiescence to America means we have to bow to Israel as well, so in an election year, which Political Party will show some actual independent foreign policy and expel the Apartheid  Israeli embassy for their ongoing occupation and crimes against the Palestinian people?\n\nIt’s time for NZ to reclaim it’s reputation as being a fair global citizen and denounce Apartheid Israel for its mindless ongoing violence. Nothing says we aren’t America’s gimp more clearly than sending their 51st State packing.",

He wants an invasion.\n\n\n\n(Avigdor Lieberman speaking)\n\n\n\n\"The answer must be clear,\" Mr Lieberman said. \"To go all the way is not just to give a blow, I always say here 'We will give retaliation, we will give them a blow'. There is no need to give blows; there is no need to retaliate. There is a need to lead, there is a need to end this operation when the Israeli Army is in control over the whole Gaza Strip.\"\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry was due to fly to Cairo to assist in the efforts to negotiate peace.\n\n\n\nNow he's changed his mind, but he hasn't given up hope that something can be salvaged from this diplomatic effort.\n\n\n\nJOHN KERRY: We believe that it was important to give this offer an opportunity and I still think perhaps reason could prevail if the political wing can deal with the military wing and Egypt can have some leverage, let's see what happens. \n\n\n\nHAYDEN COOPER: Overnight, the first Israeli was killed since this conflict began - a victim of rocket fire. The Palestinian death toll is almost 200.\n\n\n\nThis is Hayden Cooper in Jerusalem for AM.",

            "text": "Gaza/Jerusalem: Israel has stepped up its military offensive in Gaza saying it has “no choice” and has asked thousands of Palestinians in the coastal strip to leave their homes amid speculation that a ground operation could follow even as the death toll reached 208 amid air strikes.\n\n An Egypt mediated truce initiative yesterday failed to halt rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas militants and other groups who called it “capitulation and surrender”, choosing to continue with rocket and mortar fire. Israel, which suffered its first fatality yesterday in a mortar attack at the Ere crossing, said senior Hamas militants had died in strikes on Gaza overnight.\n\n Palestinian medics in Gaza claimed that 208 people had so far been killed in Israeli raids, including 10 overnight, and more than a 1,000 injured in the last nine days of Operation Protective Edge launched by Israel.\n\n Among those reported killed was a five-month-old baby, Palestinian medics said charging Israel of having killed mostly innocent civilians. Israel has accused Hamas and other Gaza-based militant factions of using civilians as human shields as activists of the groups went around telling people not to evacuate homes. Militants have fired more than 1,200 rockets at Israel, which on Tuesday caused the first Israeli death. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) dropped leaflets and used recorded phone messages to warn some 100,000 residents of Gaza to leave their homes on Wednesday.\n\n The warning came as militants continued to fire rockets at Israeli cities, the IDF said, adding that its Iron Dome missile shield had intercepted four rockets launched at Tel Aviv. Following continued rocket attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he now had no choice but to “expand and intensify the campaign against Hamas” and that “When there is no ceasefire, our answer is fire”.\n\n “This would have been better resolved diplomatically… but Hamas leaves us no choice but to expand and intensify the campaign against it,” he said.\n\n Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, earlier rejecting the Egyptian ceasefire proposal said it is “like an ambush”.\n\n The Egyptian-backed truce was to have started at 0600 GMT on Tuesday, after it was approved by Israel’s security cabinet. IDF halted it’s attacks for six hours, but resumed on Tuesday after militants continued to fire rockets. Hamas said the terms of the ceasefire did not address concerns over the economic blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has caused severe economic hardship for many Palestinians.\n\n Under the terms of the Egyptian initiative, the ceasefire should have been followed by a series of meetings in Cairo with high-level delegations from the two sides.\n\n But a senior Hamas spokesman, Osama Hamdan, told the BBC he had only heard about the truce initiative through the media and that a ceasefire could not be put in place without the details of any agreement being known. The armed wing of Hamas, the Izz ale-Din Qassam Brigades, dismissed the initiative, saying its battle with Israel would “increase in ferocity and intensity”. The home of top Hamas official Mahmoud al-Zahar was hit in air strikes on Gaza city early today but security sources said he was hiding in some other place. Israel has mobilised tens of thousands of troops on the border with Gaza amid speculation that a ground invasion could be imminent. “We still have the possibility of going in, under cabinet authority, and putting an end to (the rockets),” senior Israeli defence official Amos Gilad told the BBC.

civilians will feel there are no real places of safety now israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu now faces a dilemma there are rightwing members of his cabinet demanding a ground offensive and he doesnt want to look weak in domestic politics but the risks for him are significant ground fighting may cause huge numbers of casualties alienating israels allies and trap him into a long campaign

has caused severe economic hardship for many palestinians after the resumption of operations netanyahu said this would have been better resolved diplomatically thats what we tried to do when we accepted the egyptian truce proposal but hamas leaves us no choice but to expand and intensify the campaign against it under the terms of the egyptian initiative the ceasefire should have been followed by a series of meetings in cairo with highlevel delegations from the two sides but a senior hamas spokesman osama hamdan told the bbc it had only heard about the truce initiative through the media and that a ceasefire could not be put in place without the details of any agreement being known the armed wing of hamas the izz aldin qassam brigades dismissed the initiative saying its battle

Dhaka, Bangladesh (BBN)-Bangladesh is known for its apparel manufacturing industry—and for the conditions faced by garment workers toiling in Dickensian factories for a dollar a day. But according to a report released Sunday, the South Asian nation has become a top hot spot for renewable energy jobs, creating a green workforce as large as Spain’s in 2013, reports theatlantic.com. Bangladeshi’s are installing small photovoltaic systems at a rate of 80,000 a month, says the report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). In a country where only 47 percent of the population had access to electricity in 2009, according to the Asian Development Bank, solar is increasingly becoming a way to leapfrog the need to build a bigger power grid. In the past 10 years, the number of solar systems in Bangladesh has jumped from 25,000 to 2.8 million, according to IRENA. That in turn has created some 114,000 jobs, from assembling solar panels to selling, installing and maintaining them. In fact, the number of solar-related jobs nearly doubled between 2011 and 2013. “The numbers are set to increase further,” wrote the report’s authors. (By comparison some 4 million people work in Bangladesh’s garment industry.) Solar energy accounted for 2.3 million of the world’s 6.5 million renewable energy-related jobs in 2013, according to the report. About 70 percent of those solar positions were in China, the biggest green-job generator with 2.6 million people employed in renewable energy overall. More than 1.1 million green jobs are in the European Union, an early leader in promoting carbon-free energy to fight climate change. The United States came in third with 625,000 renewable energy jobs. Solar, wind and biofuels accounted for most of those jobs. Wind jobs have risen as more manufacturers have moved factories to the U.S. On the other hand, those jobs come and go as Congress allows a key subsidy for wind-generated electricity, the Production Tax Credit, to periodically expire. Brazil, however, is a biofuels powerhouse. The country is the world’s biggest grower of sugarcane, which is used to make ethanol. About 894,000 people were employed in renewable energy jobs in 2013 with about 70 percent of those positions related to biofuel production. “Regional shifts from developed to emerging countries continued in wind and solar technologies, predominantly in the manufacturing and installation segments of the value chain,” the report stated.

Dhaka, Bangladesh (BBN)-Bangladesh is working on a new scheme that will give early warning of storms and lightning strikes in a bid to combat rising deaths from the hazards. “We are going to set up 10 thunderstorm observation centres in maritime ports, aiming to provide early warning to avoid deaths from increasingly frequent lightning strikes,” Local Government and Rural Development Minister Syed Ashraful Islam told parliament last month. The centres will track storms across the whole country but are being built near ports, as coastal and river areas are especially vulnerable to extreme weather, with fishermen often working out on the open water, reports Reuters. The government-funded centres have been built and equipment is now being installed. The project is due to be up and running by next year. Ashraful Islam said the number of thunderstorms hitting the South Asian tropical region has increased significantly in recent years, which he attributed to global warming. “If we can give early warning through examining the instability of the atmosphere, we may be able to reduce unwanted deaths,” he said. In recent years, reports of deaths from lightning strikes have become frequent – although comprehensive figures have not been recorded. For example, on May 30, at least 7 people died and many were injured in lighting strikes across Naogaon district in northern Bangladesh. In 2010, Bangladesh recorded a quarter of annual global deaths due to lightning strikes when some 102 people were killed, according to the New Age newspaper. Bangladesh currently has no lightning detectors, but that will change under the new system, according to meteorologist Sadekul Alam. Atiq Rahman, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies (BCAS), said early warning of lightning strikes through examining cloud movements is possible, and could help avoid some deaths. Rahman said that, in recent years, winds have become stronger, accompanied by more frequent thunderstorms. Climate change has clear linkages with this rise in extreme weather, he added. Yet if the new warning system is to help avoid deaths, people must know how to act on alerts, Rahman stressed. Experts recommend staying inside during thunderstorms, and away from windows and doors. Abul Kalam Mallik of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department in Dhaka said the country’s weather offices advise people about weather conditions as part of their routine work. “If there is anything unusual due to happen, a special bulletin is also broadcast to inform people of possible danger,” he told Thomson Reuters Foundation. High temperatures and humidity in Bangladesh mean weather conditions can be unstable, resulting in thunderstorms and lightning strikes, he added. The thunderstorm observation centres will be equipped with modern technology that can provide customised warnings about possible lightning strikes in specific areas, even narrowing the risk down to particular districts. The alerts will be disseminated via radio and television bulletins, as well as by megaphone in some coastal areas. Shamsul Alam, a climate change expert and member of Bangladesh’s Planning Commission, said many other countries, including the United States and India, are successfully providing warning of storms and lightning strikes. “Global temperature rise has caused various changes, including an increased number of thunderstorms, cyclones and other natural calamities. As the weather is becoming more extreme due to warmer temperatures, we need more advanced technology to predict weather movements and their impacts,” he said. If locally tailored warnings can be issued, and people are made aware of the need to follow advice, deaths from lightning strikes may be reduced, he added. Ainun Nishat, an eminent environmentalist and vice chancellor of Brac University, said rising temperatures have caused more evaporation and cloud formation in recent years. At the same time, Bangladesh’s population has grown. “Due to high population density, one lightning strike kills many people,” he said.  “Earlier we saw the tops of many big trees being burned by lighting strikes. But nowadays, due to massive urbanisation and increased use of cultivable lands, large trees are removed. So during thunderstorms, when a farmer or anyone else stays out in an open field, they are being hit by lightning,” Nishat said. Raising awareness among people - especially those likely to remain outdoors during storms - and providing early warning would certainly help reduce casualties, he added. Read more... Dhaka, Bangladesh (BBN)-Bangladesh is expecting more than $2 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2014 as the political climate has improved since last year. Construction of specialised economic zones and the auctioning off of offshore gas blocks are likely to boost FDI this year. \"Chances of foreign companies coming in to explore gas in the offshore blocks at the Bay of Bengal are higher\" because of a recent verdict clearing maritime disputes for Bangladesh, Badrul Imam, professor of geology at the University of Dhaka, tells Monitor Global Outlook. Recent deals with China for a 3.8-mile Padma Bridge, an industrial zone for ready-made garments with Chinese investment, as well as a specialised economic zone will be among key investments, the report added. \"If law and order and the political environment remain stable we should get $2-$2.5 billion FDI in 2014,\" Nabhash Chandra Mandal, additional secretary at Bangladesh's Board of Investment, tells MGO. The South Asian country earned $1.7 billion in FDI in 2013, according to the latest data by the central bank of Bangladesh. The World Investment Report released by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development on June 24 stated the country's FDI at $1.6 billion in 2013 based on provisional figures, says Mohammed Akhtaruzzaman, economic advisor of Bangladesh Bank. The central bank's data shows transport and storage received the highest amount of FDI at $527.09 million, followed by telecommunication $525.29 million, readymade garments $412.43 million and banking $268.53 million. To attract investment Bangladesh has extended its tax holiday for new investors from 2015 to 2019 and instituted tax rebates up to 20 percent for industries setting up in least-developed areas for 10 years from the date of commencing operations. The government has also reduced the corporate income tax from 37.5 percent to 35 percent. Bangladesh's FDI target for 2014 is within its average growth rate. The incentives will fall short of attracting a higher FDI target because of some inherent disincentives, such as a slow-paced bureaucracy, shortages of energy sources, inconsistent policy implementation, and cumbersome customs processing, says Jamil Osman, executive director of Foreign Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry Bangladesh.

Dhaka, Bangladesh (BBN) - The central bank of Bangladesh will unveil the next monetary policy on July 27 to contain inflation and helping the productive sectors for achieving maximum economic growth, officials said on Wednesday. Bangladesh Bank (BB) Governor Atiur Rahman will announce the half-yearly (July-December) monetary policy statement (MPS) on the day aiming to gear up the country’s overall economic activities through boosting private investment from both local and foreign.  “The BB wants to keep lower inflationary pressure and higher economic growth through employment generation across the country,” a BB official told BBN in Dhaka. He also hinted that the private sector credit growth may increase slightly in the next MPS. The central bank earlier fixed the private sector credit growth target at 16.5 per cent for the second half-yearly MPS of the fiscal year (FY) 2013-14. “We need to expedite investment in different productive sectors for achieving desirable economic growth by the end of this fiscal year,” another BB official said. He also said the central bank is also giving emphasis to curb inflationary pressure on the economy for achieving sustainable economic growth. The country's inflation as measured by consumers' price index (CPI) eased slightly in the month of June last on both the annual average and point-to-point basis mainly because of declining prices of food items. The inflation rate came down to 7.35 per cent in June 2014 from 7.44 per cent of the previous month on the annual average basis, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) data.  On the other hand, the point-to-point inflation rate felt to 6.97 per cent in June last from 7.48 per cent of the previous month, the BBS data showed.

New Delhi, India (BBN)-India tops the list of countries with the largest share of extremely poor though the poverty rate in southeast Asia as whole saw a substantial fall from 1990 to 2010, a new United Nations report said. The poverty rate in southeast Asia fell from 45 percent in 1990 to 14 percent in 2010. Although poverty remains widespread in south Asia, progress in the region has been substantial, the Millenium Development Goals Report 2014 said. However, India had the largest share of global poor at 32.9 percent, more than countries like China, Nigeria and Bangladesh, said the report which was released here Wednesday. India also had the highest child mortality rate worldwide in 2012 with 1.4 million children dying before reaching their fifth birthday, it said. In 2012, south Asia accounted for 2.1 million of the 6.6 million deaths in children under five worldwide and with 1.4 million children dying before reaching their fifth birthday, India had the highest child mortality rate worldwide, the report which tracks progress in achieving the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) said. The eight MDGs, with a number of sub-targets covering a range of poverty, hunger, health, gender equality, education and environmental indicators, were agreed by all countries as an outgrowth of the UN Millennium Summit in 2000, most with a due date of 2015. \"India's role in global development is the most important in the world. The MDGs can't be reached globally if they are not reached here,\" Lise Grande, United Nations Resident Coordinator for India, said while releasing the report. \"The new post 2015 framework cannot succeed if it does not reflect the aspirations, and does not have the commitment and support of India.\" \"India's commitment to reach the MDGs has been an inspiration to countries around the world; its leadership now in defining the new framework has never been more important,\" she added. The report said south Asia has made great progress on the MDGs, but requires greater efforts to achieve most targets by the end of 2015. In South Asia, the adjusted net enrolment rate of children of primary school age increased from 80 percent in 2000 to 94 percent in 2012. However, gender parity in the region is yet to be achieved in Afghanistan and Pakistan - where there are at most nine girls for every ten boys enrolled - and Bangladesh and Nepal - where the gender disparity favours girls.

An Egyptian truce initiative on Tuesday failed to halt rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas militants and other groups, reports BBC. Israel, which had its first fatality on Tuesday, said senior Hamas militants had died in strikes on Gaza overnight. Palestinian officials say Israeli raids have killed 204 people so far, including ten overnight into Wednesday. Among those reported killed was a five-month-old baby. Its stated objective is to halt Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel, but the United Nations says the majority of those killed in Gaza have been civilians. Israelis are seen taking refuge in a bomb shelter in the city of Ashkelon on Tuesday. Twenty-four hours on from the first faltering attempts at a ceasefire, the conflict between Israel and Hamas grinds on to a grimly familiar pattern. Israel says its warnings are to avoid civilian casualties in planned raids but they'll spread further fear, anger and uncertainty in Gaza where civilians will feel there are no real places of safety now. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now faces a dilemma. There are right-wing members of his cabinet demanding a ground offensive and he doesn't want to look weak in domestic politics. But the risks for him are significant. Ground fighting may cause huge numbers of casualties, alienating Israel's allies, and trap him into a long campaign without a clear exit strategy. Instinctively he seems to feel that Israelis would prefer to see Hamas diminished and the rocket fire ended through the air campaign. Ground fighting would mean Israeli casualties too. But if air power doesn't prove decisive, the political pressure for him to go further will grow. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) dropped leaflets and used recorded telephone messages to warn some 100,000 residents of Gaza to leave their homes before 08:00 (05:00 GMT) on Wednesday. The warning came as militants continued to fire rockets at Israeli cities, the IDF said, adding that its Iron Dome missile shield had intercepted four rockets launched at Tel Aviv. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier announced he had \"no choice\" but to step up the military campaign. \"When there is no ceasefire, our answer is fire,\" Netanyahu said. The Egyptian-backed truce was to have started at 09:00 (06:00 GMT) on Tuesday, after it was approved by Israel's security cabinet. Israeli attacks were halted for six hours, but resumed after militants continued to fire dozens of rockets. Hamas said the terms of the ceasefire did not address concerns over the economic blockade of the Gaza strip, which has caused severe economic hardship for many Palestinians. After the resumption of operations, Netanyahu said: \"This would have been better resolved diplomatically; that's what we tried to do when we accepted the Egyptian truce proposal. \"But Hamas leaves us no choice but to expand and intensify the campaign against it.\" Under the terms of the Egyptian initiative, the ceasefire should have been followed by a series of meetings in Cairo with high-level delegations from the two sides. But a senior Hamas spokesman, Osama Hamdan, told the BBC it had only heard about the truce initiative through the media and that a ceasefire could not be put in place without the details of any agreement being known. The armed wing of Hamas, the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades, dismissed the initiative, saying its battle with Israel would \"increase in ferocity and intensity\". Netanyahu came under criticism in Israel for accepting the truce initiative. His office announced that deputy defence minister Danny Danon had been sacked for comments branding the PM a \"failure\". Israel has mobilised tens of thousands of troops on the border with Gaza amid speculation a ground invasion could be launched. Israeli defence official Amos Gilad said: \"We still have the possibility of going in, under cabinet authority, and putting an end to [the rockets].\" US state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Israel had the right to defend itself, but added that \"no-one wants a ground war\". The IDF said militants had fired more than 150 rockets into Israel on Tuesday, and more than 1,260 since Operation Protective Edge began. The air force and navy had carried out strikes on 96 targets in Gaza on Tuesday, and more than 1,750 in the past eight days, it added. A 38-year-old Israeli man is said to have been killed by a mortar shell fired from Gaza near the northern border with Israel. The UN says at least 1,370 homes have been destroyed in Gaza and more than 18,000 people displaced in recent hostilities. The International Red Cross warned that repeated bombing was devastating Gaza's \"fragile water infrastructure\", with hundreds of people left without water. Read more... Beijing, China (BBN)-China’s territorial disputes are taking a toll on its image with many Asians concerned its claims will lead to military conflicts, according to a Pew Research Center report. Majorities of people surveyed in eight of 11 Asian nations worry China’s disputes could lead to armed clashes, including 93 percent of Filipinos, 85 percent of Japanese, 84 percent of Vietnamese and 83 percent of South Koreans, the report released in Washington said. China is embroiled in a dispute with Japan over islets in the East China Sea, with Vietnam for oil exploration in contested waters, and with the Philippines where it is building artificial islands in an area claimed by both, reports Bloomberg. China also says part of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh is Chinese. “Asians’ concerns about China reflect the fact that, as Asia’s largest economic and military power sitting at the center of the region, Beijing has territorial disputes with many of its neighbors,” the report said. China’s neighbors aren’t alone. In the U.S., which is allied with Japan and the Philippines, 67 percent of respondents were concerned about the prospect of military conflict arising from the disputes and among the Chinese themselves, 62 percent expressed concern, the report showed. China’s growing economic might is considered a good thing by most countries, though China’s increasing prosperity is considered a threat in some. Across 43 nations, a median of 49 percent expressed a favorable opinion of China, while 32 percent gave an unfavorable rating, the report showed. China’s image in the U.S. has deteriorated, with 35 percent expressing a positive view, down from half in 2011, the report said. In Asia, two-thirds or more of those surveyed in the predominately Muslim nations of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia voiced a favorable overall opinion of China. A majority also held positive views in Thailand and South Korea. In contrast, majorities in Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines had unfavorable overall views of China. Pew surveyed 48,643 respondents in 44 countries from March 17 to June 5. Read more... New York (BBN)-In a conference call with analysts following the release of its second quarter earnings report Tuesday, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon took the time to single out Federal Housing Administration (FHA) backed lending as a source of risk for the Megabank. In February, the bank announced that it would pay $614 million to settle claims that it had improperly approved thousands of government backed mortgages, including those approved by the bank as a participant in the FHA's Direct Endorsement Lender program, reports DSnews. Under the program, lenders who have direct endorsement power can consider single-family FHA mortgage applications without first submitting paperwork to HUD. Skipping that step allows FHA mortgages to be processed as rapidly as other mortgages. Dimon said that the bank’s FHA business has cost them money. “So the real question is should we be in the FHA business at all? We’re still struggling with that,” Dimon said. \"Until they come up with some kind of safe harbors or something, we're going to be very, very cautious in that line of business,\" Dimon said. JPMorgan is not alone in its struggle with FHA compliance. In June, Suntrust Banks, Inc. announced that it would pay $418 million to resolve its potential liability for originating and underwriting FHA loans between January 2006 and March 2012 that did not meet agency requirements. The problem is a catch-22 for the banks. FHA backed lending is in place so that riskier borrowers have access to credit and, in theory at least, lenders make higher profits because the pool of qualified borrowers increases. The problem is that with that riskier clientele comes with a higher risk of default. After the fact, government auditors have the power to scrutinize defaulted loans and demand repayment from the bank if they determine that the bank has not underwritten the loans according to HUD standards. From the tone of his comments on Tuesday, it could be inferred that JPMorgan does not believe the process to be fair. Dimon said that his organization was “thoroughly confused” by the government treatment of the bank during the settlement process. Whether Dimon is serious about pulling out of the FHA business or not remains to be seen but the consequences would likely be felt by consumers. JPMorgan is the nation’s second largest mortgage lender. Read more...

next phase of the violence thats killed nearly 200 palestinians in gaza is in flux today with a ceasefire still on the table on tuesday the egyptian government proposed a temporary halt to violence and the reopening of gazas border crossings followed by talks in cairo on a longterm truce israels security cabinet has endorsed the proposal but hamas has yet to officially respond the hamas military wing has rejected the pact as a quote surrender saying the ceasefire fails to meet any of its core demands these include a lifting of the seige of gaza the release of prisoners recently detained in israeli raids an end to israeli attacks on the occupied territories and respect for the palestinian unity government but its hamass political wing that will have the final say earlier today israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu vowed to widen the attack on gaza if hamas rejects the ceasefire and if rocket fire continues prime minister benjamin netanyahu translated we agreed to the egyptian proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarization of the gaza strip from missiles from rockets and from tunnels through diplomatic means but if hamas does not accept the ceasefire proposal as would now seem to be the case israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet amy goodman the threat of more violence follows a week that saw israel kill at least 192 palestinians in a massive bombing campaign on one of the worlds most densely populated areas the united nations estimates more than 80 percent of gazas dead are civilians including 36 children more than a thousand rockets from gaza have hit israel over the same period with just a fraction landing in urban areas around a dozen israelis have been wounded there have been no israelis reported killed for more were joined by amira hass shes the haaretz correspondent for the occupied palestinian territories the only israeli journalist to have spent years living in and reporting from gaza and the west bank she is joining us from ramallah amira hass can you talk about this latest development the egyptian proposal for a ceasefire israel accepting it hamas is weighing it amira hass yeah its exactly because hamas feels that this was a proposal boiled up with israel without any consultation with hamas and this is something thats forced on them and also reported through the media and not through negotiations or prior negotiations everybody knows that the leadership of egypt right now is an enemy of hamas an enemy of the muslim brothers and they feel humiliated and they feel that it is not meant to bring progress and change for the palestinians in gaza but to further marginalize them as a movement as a political movement aaron maté amira youve spoken to members of hamas youve interview them for haaretz what demands do they have for a ceasefire that they would respect amira hass their demands are of course to return first to the 2012 agreement or understanding that israel should open the crossings at least for goods and raw material and then allow people to leave through rafah they more or less neglected the idea i mean the hope that israel would allow palestinians leaving from erez from the northern west—northern gaza strip to the west bank this is something they have neglected but—or dont have much hope about this but at least for goods and raw materials and movement peoples movement through egypt this is one another thing that they say we see that israel always does not abide by its commitments and we need guarantees international guarantees that it does for next ceasefire because its time we find—have some understanding israel comes and has breaches—for example the fishermen it was agreed in 2012 the fishermen would be able to fish and not be shot at all whenever they move—i dont know—one kilometer away one maritime mile from the shore as israel does shoot at them things like that this is one another one of course is the release of all the prisoners that had been released in the last two three years within the shalit exchange of prisoners that israel in the past two months arrested most of them or many the great majority of them who are associated with hamas and there is a demand to release them again there is a demand to—yeah these are the basic demands there are other prisoners that israel—hamas prisoners hamas activists in the west bank political activists who have been arrested and they should also be released so these are very very—as i was told by somebody who is a great israel—an old opponent of hamas he said these demands are very very reasonable and even minimal we should even demand more we should demand more that israel does not fight for example the reconciliation government that it allows it to function we should demand that people move leave the west bank—leave gaza strip and be able to reconnect with the west bank so the demands the hamas demands are quite basic amy goodman so far amira hass here in the united states the coverage of the egyptian ceasefire proposal is that here is a ceasefire that israel says it will embrace it will stop the attack and hamas is probably going to reject it that is the story here in the united states that is being told amira hass yeah unfortunately just as the story has been told that israel was attacked and the palestinians are the aggressor and i mean we know—i dont remember which channel but there was this absurd report showing destruction of a palestinian home that was bombed by israel and it was said that this was an israeli home israeli house amy goodman that was diane sawyers report on abc showing a weeping palestinian mother in front of her destroyed home— amira hass yes amy goodman —and it said palestinians destroyed this israeli home amira hass inaudible but so far it seems that the international or at least the western community is not appalled by israels attack onslaught and as somebody told me if this is ok according to international law then there is something—something stinks with international law a senior diplomat told me that who does not succeed in convincing his government to have a clear stand against it now its true that according to international law palestinians also—the palestinian rockets are against international law and also targeting civilians and they succeeded they have succeeded hamas in inflicting fear among many many israelis and also in somehow ridiculing the israeli security establishment who boasted in the first two days that hamas has suffered a big blow a great blow which it hasnt i mean militarily speaking the great gain of hamas is that it has united—or israel actually has united also the opponents of hamas who are behind hamas the people see the ability of hamas and islamic jihad to launch missiles at israel toward israel while they are being attacked and so severely by such a strong military power its already an achievement and somebody told me its not about killing its about a message a message that we are not going—that if you expect palestinians to give up the struggle against the end of occupation you are mistaken this is how palestinians understand the missiles the launching of missiles its true that there are—also the international media gives a lot of—and also of course the israeli—gives a lot of prominence to demands of palestinians for revenge but this is not so much about the revenge as the feeling that one is standing up against israel and this is something that the palestinian authority has not done israel has been really humiliating the palestinian authority for so many years even though the palestinian authority has given so many—has had so many concessions and agreed with so many demands of the israeli government so people are weighing this one against the other and they even secular who really detest hamas ideology feel that right now hamas represented them in saying no we are not going to give up the struggle against occupation aaron maté amira and can you give us a rundown of what you see as israels goals here in this gaza conflict amira hass thats even more difficult every fight israel did everything possible to foil the very very weak reconciliation government which is not a unity government because hamas has left it so it does over and over what people say mistake but we think its not a mistake but it has had a policy for the past 20 years to disconnect gaza from the west bank it succeeded in it enormously and especially when hamas and fatah had split and created the two governments of the two territories gaza and the west bank but now when palestinians show signs that they understand that this is so much against their struggle this split between gaza and the west bank a split within the palestinian movement and they tried to change it israel comes and has to defend its main achievement of the past 20 years which was this separation between gaza and the west bank because the twostate solution is based on the not only assumption but on this principle that gaza and the west bank are the palestinian state alongside israel and israel has done everything possible to foil it from 93 94—actually since 91 so in essence this war again is in order to protect or to maintain this main achievement of israeli policy of the past 20 years in the past five six years both fatah and hamas played into the hands of the israel in that the hamas government did not think really about reconnecting with the west bank and the pa in ramallah really didnt care about gaza and made all kind of mistakes to let it go and create a vacuum there that hamas with full right filled in especially vacuum in the administration of gaza and now they tried to fix it because the results were publicdemanded popular demand mostly in gaza—i think in the west bank people do not—it has always been so people in the west bank feel very far away detached from gaza and we see these days during the attacks on gaza there isnt mobilization in the west bank to show the shock that people feel im sure they are but there isnt much movement except of some villages where villagers young people young men of also refugee camps go and clash with the army as a symbol of protest but this is the main—this is the main goal and of course the main goal is to maintain the occupation i mean to repress any opposition any resistance so the means change sometimes it is a mass arrest in the west bank and then a mass—i mean intensive colonization of what is left in the west bank or more construction and sometimes it is a negotiation process that leads nowhere and sometimes these are bloody attacks as we are experiencing now amy goodman amira hass we want to thank you for being with us haaretz correspondent for the occupied palestinian territories shes the only journalist to have spent—well she lived for 20 years in gaza and the west bank reporting from there she was awarded the

On Tuesday, the Egyptian government proposed a temporary halt to violence and the reopening of Gaza’s border crossings, followed by talks in Cairo on a long-term truce. Israel’s Security Cabinet has endorsed the proposal, but Hamas has yet to officially respond.

But it’s Hamas’s political wing that will have the final say. Earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to widen the attack on Gaza if Hamas rejects the ceasefire and if rocket fire continues.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The threat of more violence follows a week that saw Israel kill at least 192 Palestinians in a massive bombing campaign on one of the world’s most densely populated areas. The United Nations estimates more than 80 percent of Gaza’s dead are civilians, including 36 children. More than a thousand rockets from Gaza have hit Israel over the same period, with just a fraction landing in urban areas. Around a dozen Israelis have been wounded. There have been no Israelis reported killed.\n\nFor more, we’re joined by Amira Hass. She’s the Ha’aretz correspondent for the occupied Palestinian territories, the only Israeli journalist to have spent years living in and reporting from Gaza and the West Bank. She is joining us from Ramallah.\n\nAmira Hass, can you talk about this latest development, the Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire, Israel accepting it, Hamas is weighing it?\n\nAMIRA HASS: Yeah, it’s exactly because Hamas feels that this was a proposal boiled up with Israel without any consultation with Hamas. And this is something that’s forced on them and also reported through the media and not through negotiations or prior negotiations. Everybody knows that the leadership of Egypt right now is an enemy of Hamas, an enemy of the Muslim Brothers. And they feel humiliated, and they feel that it is not meant to bring progress and change for the Palestinians in Gaza, but to further marginalize them as a movement, as a political movement.\n\nAARON MATÉ: Amira, you’ve spoken to members of Hamas.

They more or less neglected the idea, I mean, the hope that Israel would allow Palestinians leaving from Erez from the northern west—northern Gaza Strip to the West Bank. This is something they have neglected, but—or don’t have much hope about this. But at least for goods and raw materials and movement, people’s movement through Egypt. This is one.\n\nAnother thing that they say: \"We see that Israel always does not abide by its commitments, and we need guarantees, international guarantees, that it does, for next ceasefire, because it’s time we find—have some understanding.\" Israel comes and has breaches—for example, the fishermen. It was agreed in 2012 the fishermen would be able to fish and not be shot at all, whenever they move—I don’t know—one kilometer away, one maritime mile from the shore, as Israel does shoot at them. Things like that, this is one.\n\nAnother one, of course, is the release of all the prisoners that had been released in the last two, three years within the Shalit exchange of prisoners, that Israel in the past two months arrested most of them, or many, the great majority of them who are associated with Hamas. And there is a demand to release them again. There is a demand to—yeah, these are the basic demands. There are other prisoners that Israel—Hamas prisoners, Hamas activists in the West Bank, political activists, who have been arrested, and they should also be released.\n\nSo these are very, very—as I was told by somebody who is a great Israel—an old opponent of Hamas, he said these demands are very, very reasonable and even minimal. We should even demand more. We should demand more that Israel does not fight, for example, the reconciliation government, that it allows it to function. We should demand that people move, leave the West Bank—leave Gaza Strip and be able to reconnect with the West Bank.

And, I mean, we know—I don’t remember which channel, but there was this absurd report showing destruction of a Palestinian home that was bombed by Israel, and it was said that this was an Israeli home, Israeli house.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That was Diane Sawyer’s report on ABC, showing a weeping Palestinian mother in front of her destroyed home—\n\nAMY GOODMAN: —and it said Palestinians destroyed this Israeli home.\n\nAMIRA HASS: [inaudible] But so far it seems that the international, or at least the Western, community is not appalled by Israel’s attack, onslaught. And as somebody told me, if this is OK according to international law, then there is something—something stinks with international law. A senior diplomat told me that, who does not succeed in convincing his government to have a clear stand against it.\n\nNow, it’s true that according to international law, Palestinians also—the Palestinian rockets are against international law and also targeting civilians. And they succeeded. They have succeeded, Hamas, in inflicting fear among many, many Israelis, and also in somehow ridiculing the Israeli security establishment, who boasted in the first two days that Hamas has suffered a big blow, a great blow, which it hasn’t, I mean, militarily speaking.\n\nThe great gain of Hamas is that it has united—or Israel, actually, has united also the opponents of Hamas who are behind Hamas. The people see the ability of Hamas and Islamic Jihad to launch missiles at Israel, toward Israel, while they are being attacked, and so severely, by such a strong military power, it’s already an achievement. And somebody told me it’s not about killing, it’s about a message, a message that we are not going—that if you expect Palestinians to give up the struggle against the end of occupation, you are mistaken. This is how Palestinians understand the missiles, the launching of missiles. It’s true that there are—also the international media gives a lot of—and also, of course, the Israeli—gives a lot of prominence to demands of Palestinians for revenge. But this is not so much about the revenge as the feeling that one is standing up against Israel. And this is something that the Palestinian Authority has not done. Israel has been really humiliating the Palestinian Authority for so many years, even though the Palestinian Authority has given so many—has had so many concessions and agreed with so many demands of the Israeli government. So people are weighing this, one against the other. And they, even secular, who really detest Hamas’ ideology, feel that right now Hamas represented them in saying, \"No, we are not going to give up the struggle against occupation.\"\n\nAARON MATÉ: Amira, and can you give us a rundown of what you see as Israel’s goals here in this Gaza conflict?\n\nAMIRA HASS: That’s even more difficult. Every fight, Israel did everything possible to foil the very, very weak reconciliation government, which is not a unity government, because Hamas has left it. So, it does over and over what people say mistake, but we think it’s not a mistake. But it has had a policy for the past 20 years to disconnect Gaza from the West Bank. It succeeded in it enormously, and especially when Hamas and Fatah had split and created the two governments of the two territories, Gaza and the West Bank. But now when Palestinians show signs that they understand that this is so much against their struggle, this split between Gaza and the West Bank, a split within the Palestinian movement, and they tried to change it, Israel comes and has to defend its main achievement of the past 20 years, which was this separation between Gaza and the West Bank, because the two-state solution is based on the, not only assumption, but on this principle that Gaza and the West Bank are the Palestinian state alongside Israel. And Israel has done everything possible to foil it, from ’93, ’94—actually, since ’91. So, in essence, this war, again, is in order to protect or to maintain this main achievement of Israeli policy of the past 20 years.\n\nIn the past five, six years, both Fatah and Hamas played into the hands of the Israel in that the Hamas government did not think really about reconnecting with the West Bank, and the PA in Ramallah really didn’t care about Gaza and made all kind of mistakes to let it go and create a vacuum there that Hamas, with full right, filled in, especially vacuum in the administration of Gaza. And now they tried to fix it. Because the results were public-demanded, popular demand, mostly in Gaza—I think in the West Bank people do not—it has always been so people in the West Bank feel very far away, detached from Gaza. And we see these days, during the attacks on Gaza, there isn’t mobilization in the West Bank to show the shock that people feel. I’m sure they are, but there isn’t much movement, except of some villages where villagers, young people, young men of also refugee camps, go and clash with the army as a symbol of protest.\n\nBut this is the main—this is the main goal. And, of course, the main goal is to maintain the occupation, I mean, to repress any opposition, any resistance. So, the means change. Sometimes it is a mass arrest in the West Bank and then a mass—I mean, intensive colonization of what is left in the West Bank or more construction. And sometimes it is a negotiation process that leads nowhere. And sometimes these are bloody attacks, as we are experiencing now.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Amira Hass, we want to thank you for being with us, Ha’aretz correspondent for the occupied Palestinian territories.

            "text": "Israel's security cabinet accepted an Egyptian proposal for a cease-fire with militants in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday morning to end eight days of hostilities. The proposal outlined a \"de-escalation\" of fighting as of 9 a.m. and a cessation of hostilities within 12 hours, which would be followed by meetings between high-level delegations within 48 hours and Israel opening up a border crossing into Gaza. However, Hamas has not agreed to a truce, and Israel reported that since 9 a.m., over 20 rockets had been launched from Gaza. In Cairo, senior Hamas official Moussa Abu Marzouk said the movement was considering the cease-fire, although, the group's armed wing rejected it, saying it wasn't consulted on a truce and that the battle would \"increase in ferocity and intensity.\" Additionally, other Palestinian militant groups said they had not agreed to the Egyptian proposal. Naval and air strikes on the Gaza Strip have killed at least 192 people and wounded over 1,100 others since Israel launched Operation Protective Edge, and more than 900 rockets and mortars have landed in Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said if Hamas does not accept the cease-fire, \"Israel would have all international legitimacy to broaden the military operation to achieve the required quiet.\"\n\nThe United Nations Security Council in a unanimous vote Monday passed a resolution that will allow humanitarian aid convoys to deliver assistance to rebel-held areas without the Syrian government's approval. Prior to the resolution, nearly 90 percent of U.N. humanitarian aid in Syria had been delivered to people in government-held regions. The United Nations estimates about half of Syria's population of 10.8 million people is in need of assistance due to the conflict, and about 4.7 million people are in hard-to-reach areas. The Syrian government has demanded all aid be routed through Damascus and has called the move an attack on its sovereignty. The deliveries could begin by the end of the week, and conveys will cross into Syria from Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey.\n\n'Gaza and Israel: New Obstacles, New Solutions' (International Crisis Group)\n\n\"But the reconciliation agreement might also hold the key to squaring the ceasefire circle. Though opposed by Israel, the deal, if implemented, offers the best chance of alleviating Gaza's misery and lessening Hamas's incentives to fight. The Islamist movement long resisted admitting any PA presence, but now that it has renounced governance, a door has been opened, and with it, an opportunity to redesign the peace process and advance the well-being of Gaza's 1.7 million residents. Hamas for the foreseeable future will continue to be the de facto security authority on the ground, even if reconciliation moves forward; indeed, reconciliation will need to be implemented in a manner that does not wholly abandon or alienate the employees hired by Hamas and thereby trigger new civil strife. Continuing Gaza's isolation, however, would do nothing to loosen the movement's control. And should it, it would only be in the direction of jihadis.\"\n\n'Still Between Iraq and a Hard Place' (Curtis Ryan, MERIP)\n\n\"The old joke about Jordan's political geography -- that the country sits \"between Iraq and a hard place\" -- seems morbidly, and not at all amusingly, appropriate once again. Violent conflict is intensifying on three borders: Syria is aflame, in the third year of a horrific civil war; Iraq is racked with renewed internal strife; and now Israel is again bombarding Gaza, with Palestinian civilians suffering the bulk of the casualties and Hamas firing mostly useless rockets in response. Speculation has begun about a third intifada.\n\nIn the midst of all this turmoil, reports suggest that the United States is looking to expand its training of, and support for, Syrian rebels -- presumably with the Hashemite Kingdom as its main base. The Jordanian regime is said to be reluctant to highlight its precarious connection to this operation. The regime has previously been linked to rebel factions deemed moderate in Western capitals and has allowed some representatives of the opposition Syrian National Coalition (SNC) to stay in Jordan, even as the kingdom maintains diplomatic ties with the Asad regime in Damascus. Even the row over Jordan's ouster of the Syrian ambassador did not lead to a formal break.\"\n\n\"The continued stalemate in Bahrain is hurting all sides. This dispute has provided Iran with a convenient opportunity for violent interference, and it could threaten America's most important naval base in the Middle East. The regime has had to contend with constant acts of sabotage, such as road blockages, Molotov cocktails and improvised explosive devices. The Bahraini opposition -- already marginalized politically -- is also suffering, as more radical forces have pushed to outflank it.\n\nLooking forward, there are three central questions that could determine the outcome of this crisis. First, are King Hamad and the royal family prepared to end the regime's oppressive practices for imposing public order? Second, is the opposition prepared to accept an accord that falls short of its full goals? Third, is the Obama administration prepared to apply serious American statecraft in order to facilitate such an accord?\"",
