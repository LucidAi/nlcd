Petroleum coke \u2014 also known as pet coke \u2014 is a black, rock-like substance produced by the petroleum industry and used as a fuel.              Detroit Bulk Storage failed to cart away all the petroleum coke by an Aug. 9 deadline listed last week in an order from Detroit's Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department, Bing's office said Tuesday.              The piles result from Marathon Oil's refining exports from oil sands in Alberta, Canada. Freighters have been taking the piles from the Detroit riverfront to Ohio.              Company spokesman Daniel Cherrin says Detroit Bulk Storage is moving the piles of pet coke but faces logistical challenges.              \"While we have been diligently working to find vessels to ship out the product, there are a limited number of ships available",

Syria's strongest backer, Russia, proposed on Monday that  Damascus save itself from a U.S. military strike over its  alleged use of chemical weapons by putting its stockpiles under  international control.                The proposal was welcomed by Syria and seized upon by the  secretary-general of the United Nations. U.S. President Barack  Obama said the offer was a potential breakthrough but had to be  handled with skepticism.                Syria has never signed a global treaty banning the storage  of chemical weapons and is believed to have large stocks of  sarin, mustard gas and VX nerve agents.",

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons  said in the document its teams had inspected 21 out of 23  chemical weapons sites across the country. The other two were  too dangerous to inspect but the chemical equipment had already  been moved to other sites which experts had visited, it said.                \"The OPCW is satisfied it has verified, and seen destroyed,  all declared critical production/mixing/filling equipment from  all 23 sites,\" the document said.                Under a Russian-American brokered deal, Damascus agreed to  destroy all its chemical weapons after Washington threatened to  use force in response to the killing of hundreds of people in a  sarin attack on the outskirts of Damascus on Aug. 21.

The inspectors, who have been gathering samples since Monday  and may already have some results after testing them through the  night at a Damascus hotel, will not point any fingers, but may  offer clues by identifying what kinds of munitions were used.                Safeguarding the integrity of samples collected in the  outskirts of Damascus, where hundreds of people are believed to  have been gassed by a banned toxic substance in an Aug. 21 air  assault, is the top priority.                \"If they don't do that, they cannot guarantee the chain of  custody, meaning that nobody tampered with the sample itself,\"  said Dieter Rothbacher, a chemical weapons expert who trained  members of the team.

The views expressed are  his own)                By John Kemp                LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The biggest output of the  U.S. oil and gas industry is not oil or gas but dirty water.                Every day, U.S. oil and gas producers bring to the surface  60 million barrels of waste water, with a salt content up to 20  times higher than sea water and laced with hazardous chemicals.                For the most part, they dispose of it safely, as required by  federal and state laws.                Most of it is re-injected into oil and gas bearing  formations to maintain pressure, or into disposal formations far  below the freshwater aquifers.                Safe disposal of so much hazardous water should put into  perspective some of the recent concerns about water management  raised by opponents of hydraulic fracturing.                                60 MILLION BARRELS                Environmentalists and policymakers have raised concerns  about the massive a",
