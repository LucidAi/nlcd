            "text": "(NaturalNews) Those who promote genetically modified crops are also quick to promote a common myth about them which says that GMO agriculture uses fewer pesticides and is therefore better for the environment.Proving this myth wrong are Brazilian farmers who work directly with the failing GM crops, on site, at the farm, on the ground.These Brazilian producers have brought the news to Ricardo Tomczyk, president of the Aprosoja farm lobby in the Mato Grosso state. The Brazilian farmers want the manufacturers of these Bt corn seeds to reimburse them, because the seeds have failed, bringing higher costs and lower yields. On top of that, the failed GM seeds, engineered by Dow, Monsanto, Syngenta AG and DuPont, haveThat's right, the caterpillars are adapting to the insecticide-producing seeds. The mutating caterpillars are for real and now thrive on the GM corn.Ricardo Tomczyk stated, \"The caterpillars should die if they eat the corn, but since they didn't die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reais ($54) per hectare... at a time that corn prices are terrible.\"Brazil's host of tropical bugs is overtaking the insecticide-laced corn seed which was intended to explode the bug's stomachs. This has forced farmers to spray excess pesticides over and over again, as they rush to compensate for yield loss. The poor corn that's leftover this year must be sopping with chemicals, and the ground -- three times as heavy with pesticides.This problem is reminiscent of a similar situation in the US that took place early 2014 in Iowa. Rootworms began taking over the crops there, forcing excessive pesticide use.For Brazil, it's a different species of worm taking over -- the, also known as the corn leaf worm or southern grass worm.Just as the Iowa farmers were blamed earlier in 2014, the Brazilian farmers are being blamed too, as the seed companies report that they warned farmers to plant part of their field with conventional seeds to prevent bug mutations.One leading culprit, Dow AgroSciences, tries to implement programs in Brazil to help corn farmers develop \"an integrated pest management system that includes, among other things, the cultivation of refuge areas.\" In the end, Dow's seed science is nothing but corporate control over world agriculture. Sadly this control is causing perpetual abuse to farmer's property, livelihood and crop yields, as well as human health and the environment. The pesticides run off somewhere, and they're likely to show up in wells and in local drinking water.Another culprit, DuPont, said they weren't contacted by Aprosoja and believe their Pioneer brand to be durable. At the end of the day (the end of each growing season), seed imperialists like Dow, Monsanto, Syngenta AG and DuPont get to dictate the world's seed supply, since the design of GM seed is created for yearly failure and constant need of \"improvement.\" Of course, the marketing mantra of these seed imperialists is to \"improve the efficiency and technology of their seed science each year,\" but this is just another way of saying that the production of farmers all around the world is now dependent upon the seed imperialists themselves.Speaking up for the farmers, Aprosoja said, \"There are barely any non-GMO seeds available... it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers.\" He also said that if reparations aren't made, then farmers in Brazil will sue the companies.",

solidifying the importance of the finding figure activated as image tools the discovery of the tdp43 mutations in als led to a paradigm shift said dr baloh who led the work in developing a tdp43

human postmortem studies of ftd performed by william seeley md and colleagues at the university of californiasan francisco have challenged the longheld view that ftd begins in superficial layers suggesting instead early injury to a subset of large neurofilamentrich layer 5 projection neurons called von economo neurons therefore the new tdp43 mouse model and human anatomical findings may converge to suggest that als and ftd in addition to their strong molecular linkage share early damage to cortical layer 5 the contribution of the sod1 model to familial als is tremendous said dr baloh

            "text": "A new transgenic mouse model with mutant TDP-43 appears to be similar to human sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, opening up new opportunities for research on targeted therapies.\n\nInvestigators at Washington University in St. Louis have developed a new animal model for familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) based on a mutation in the TAR DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) gene identified in some ALS patients. The new model may be closer to the more common sporadic form of the illness.\n\nThe TDP-43 transgenic mice initially develop normally, but by three months of age they have problems walking, lose muscle mass, and eventually become paralyzed. By five months, they are dead. Under the microscope, the investigators strained for ubiquitin and identified clumps of protein tagged for degradation within the motor neurons, but they were not sure what they were.\n\nThe new model is phenotypically different from the first transgenic model for familial ALS based on a mutation in the superoxide dismutase 1 gene developed in the 1990s. The SOD1 mice appear to have paralysis of their back legs caused by predominantly lower motor neuron degeneration. By comparison, the TDP-43 transgenic mice have mainly upper motor neuron development.\n\nBut both lines have upper and lower motor neuron damage to some degree, similar to ALS patients who may have more or less of one than the other.\n\n“We hope that the new model helps us understand ALS and can be used to test experimental medicines,” said Robert H. Baloh, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of neurology and lead author of the finding, published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in October.\n\nIn 2006, Virginia Lee, PhD, John Trojanowski, MD, PhD, and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania discovered accumulations of a protein called TDP-43 in autopsy material from patients with both ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This was the first clue that TDP-43 may be involved in ALS, but direct evidence was lacking.\n\nAcross the world, scientists turned to their patients with familial ALS to ask whether TDP-43 mutations might play a role in selectively damaging the motor neurons. By 2008, Nigel Cairns, PhD, and Alison Goate, PhD, at Washington University, identified a point mutation in one of their ALS patients. On closer inspection, the team learned that three people in two generations — this patient was the fourth in the lineage — had similar symptoms. The patient's aunt was in a nursing home with increasing paralysis, and her two brothers died with identical symptoms. Almost simultaneously, similar reports of TDP-43 mutations in patients with familial ALS appeared from other groups worldwide, solidifying the importance of the finding.\n\n“The discovery of the TDP-43 mutations in ALS led to a paradigm shift,” said Dr. Baloh, who led the work in developing a TDP-43 animal model of ALS. “It was a door that opened up for the field that we didn't know was there.”\n\nNo one is sure how TDP-43 mutations lead to ALS. They don't even know much about the role of the normal functioning of the gene. What they know is that the TDP-43 protein is involved in regulating alternative mRNA splicing and RNA metabolism.\n\nDr. Baloh said that studies are under way to answer these questions. The hope, of course, is to have a model to develop and screen new medicines for the treatment of ALS.\n\nDr. Baloh and his colleagues used the TDP-43 mutation from their ALS patient to develop the transgenic mouse model. They made a mutant transgene and attempted to express it at high levels in the brain and spinal cord. They targeted neurons in every region of the brain and spinal cord, including motor neurons. Normally, such an experiment would lead to the production of many different transgenic mouse lines. But only one mouse line survived. They learned quickly that the gene is fatally toxic if over-expressed too much. “You probably need to express it just right to get the phenotype that we observed,” said Dr. Baloh. “We were lucky to get one line. We still need more.”\n\nThey learned other lessons about TDP-43 along the way. “If you express it equally in all neurons you predominantly get degeneration of layer 5 cortical and spinal motor neurons,” Dr. Baloh said.\n\nIntriguingly, human postmortem studies of FTD, performed by William Seeley, MD, and colleagues at the University of California-San Francisco, have challenged the long-held view that FTD begins in superficial layers, suggesting instead early injury to a subset of large, neurofilament-rich Layer 5 projection neurons called von Economo neurons. Therefore the new TDP-43 mouse model and human anatomical findings may converge to suggest that ALS and FTD, in addition to their strong molecular linkage, share early damage to cortical layer 5.\n\n“The contribution of the SOD1 model to familial ALS is tremendous,” said Dr. Baloh. “That said, I think that two models are better than one, as they likely reflect different underlying pathways of disease.

            "text": "Brazilian farmers are asking Monsanto and other producers of pest-resistant corn seeds to reimburse them for money spent on additional pesticides when the bugs killed the crops instead of dying themselves. at a time that corn prices are terrible,” Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja farm lobby in Mato Grosso state, said in a statement.\n\nThe farmers, who are represented by Association of Soybean and Corn Producers of the Mato Grosso region (Aprosoja-MT) in their battle against the agricultural giants, had to spray up to three coats of additional pesticides after the scourge remained.\n\nBut Monsanto and the other seed companies are blaming the farmers, saying they warned them to plant the GMO seeds alongside conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to the toxic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein that makes the pesticide effective. Tomczyk, speaking on behalf of the farmers, said that farming with conventional seeds is not a viable option for those Aprosoja-MT represents. Aprosoja hopes to reach a negotiated agreement with the seed companies, but if all else fails farmers may sue to get reparations for pesticide costs, according to Tomczyk. In 2012, the Brazilian court ruled in favor of the Brazilian farmers, saying Monsanto owes them at least US $2 billion paid since 2004. The biotech giant promised to appeal, and reached an agreement with the farmers last August to end the litigation, Reuters reported at the time.\n\nBut in October, a judge in that country blocked Monsantos attempt to make farmers sign restrictive agreements before being able to purchase the new RR2 Intacta soybean seeds. In December, the soybean farmers again sued the GMO company for about US $1 billion for illegally collecting royalties on the old RR1 seeds and forcing the Brazilians to sign abusive purchase contracts for the new ones, according to Sustainable Pulse.\n\nRead the full article right now: Click to read",

notice honeycoloured dots sprouting from the moist earth of a bean field you might mistake them for some kind of inoffensive mushroom but theyre not mushrooms and theyre far from inoffensive theyre a telltale sign of white mold infection the scourge of carrot canola and dry bean growers across canada a fungus called sclerotinia sclerotiorum is the culprit behind the mold which inflicts substantial damage on these important crops every year and places severe curbs on their sustainable production almost every bean field in southern alberta has the fungus says alberta agriculture and rural developments dr ron howard who has been involved in white mold research for many years in severe cases it can infect 60 to 70 percent of a crop and cut the yield in half which can be devastating for a grower apothecia of the pathogenic fungus sclerotinia sclerotiorum fungicides fall short there are three traditional ways of managing the disease spraying the plants with fungicides when theyre flowering crop rotation away from susceptible crops to break the disease cycle and when they are available using resistant cultivars of crops like dry bean these approaches work best when used together but unfortunately there is a diminishing number of fungicides available a situation caused by the withdrawal of some products from the market and the phasing out of others industry government and growers have consequently been looking for alternative controls for sclerotinia rot in carrot canola and dry bean crops ideally such controls would be compatible with an integrated pest management strategy against the disease and would contribute to lowering pesticide risk the need for new approaches was abundantly clear by 2003 and it was at this point that the pesticide risk reduction program prrp entered the picture the prrp is a joint program of the pest management centre pmc and the pest management regulatory agency pmra and white mold control fell neatly under its mandate to design pesticide risk reduction strategies while improving growers access to safer controls for specific crops coordinated by and partially funded through the prrp the various stakeholders researchers and government specialists continued their efforts to address the problem they focused on the three priority crops dry beans carrots and canola that have been targeted within the broader riskreduction strategy for white mold in 2006 the dry bean white mold working group and the carrot white mold working group were set up under prrp leadership and at the same time the canola council of canada established its own canola working group as part of a larger pestmanagement approach for this particular crop clearing the way for contans one potential new control for the mold was the biopesticide contans® wg which european and us growers had been using for several years its active ingredient is the fungus coniothyrium minitans when worked into the soil this organism parasitizes and kills the soilborne overwintering bodies of the sclerotinia fungus however contans was not yet approved for use in canada so in 2006 the prrp began funding the assessment of the product for white mold control and helped the company develop the data package required for registration as a result in june 2007 the prrp submitted the contans package to the pmra for regulatory review progress since then has been brisk especially with carrots preliminary field trial results highlighting the benefits of contans for this crop have been presented to carrot growers and publication of the related extension literature is on the way on the dry bean and canola front the prrp and its partners in industry and the provinces have been equally busy weve begun major demonstration trials with beans and canola in southern alberta says dr howard theyre the biggest trials of contans ever done in canada and will be carried out over the next three years among other things theyll demonstrate the best ways for growers to use the product whether they should apply contans the autumn before they plant a susceptible crop for example or whether it works better if they apply it to a currently infested field such speedy progress means that contans should be commercially available to canadian growers of carrots beans and canola in early 2009 in plenty of time for the growing season the product will likely be registered for several other crops at the same time giving up to 11 new uses for this adaptable biopesticide carrots just a trim please biopesticides arent the only controls under investigation a new but surprisingly simple one is the carrot trimmer a tractordrawn implement developed with prrp support by agriculture and agrifood canadas aafc scientists at harrington research farm in prince edward island the machine laterally trims the canopy leaves of several rows of carrots at a time increasing airflow between the rows and leading to decreased soil moisture and higher air temperatures around the plants this change in the canopy environment discourages the growth of sclerotinia rot and reduces the need for fungicides while leaving yield unaffected aafc scientists in pei and the prrp have been working hard to tell farmers about the trimmer and as a result at least two commercial farms one in nova scotia the other in the us are already using it knowing the enemy accurate detailed information about white mold infection is a third anti sclerotinia weapon on which the prrp has concentrated its efforts to help growers spot the disease estimate its severity and make informed control decisions the canola council of canada has produced the canola disease identification and sclerotinia risk assessment card the card was printed with prrp funding and distributed during 20062007 to farmers crop consultants and agridealers across the prairies all these approaches to white mold control have a common purpose which is to become part of an integrated reducedrisk strategy for controlling the disease there is no single answer to the pest but contans carrot trimming and advanced educational materials among other tools will provide growers with powerful new weapons against this old and dangerous enemy minor in name but not in nature as any grower of lowacreage highvalue crops will tell you stopping a pest in its tracks can spell the difference between a good year and a bad one insects and disease can hack big chunks out of a small operations bottom line almost overnight so growers of these minor crops fruits herbs vegetables nursery stock and landscaping plants to name a few are always looking for better ways to keep the pests at bay such crops are called minor not because theyre of little value but because theyre grown on small acreages and they face the same pest management challenges as major crops manufacturers worldwide have developed a broad range of minorcrop pestcontrol products which are in common use outside canada but many of these controls have remained beyond the reach of our growers since theyve never been registered here this is because canadas minorcrop operations dont have the collective acreage to constitute a large enough pesticide market so manufacturers havent found it costeffective to pursue canadian registrations for many potentially useful products minor use pesticide program to the rescue the pmc s minor use pesticide program mupp is helping to change all that through field trials carried out at its minoruse research sites the mupp generates data to support regulatory submissions to the pmra and by doing so encourages pesticide manufacturers to register their products for canadian use the mupp is built on a foundation of nine research sites across canada where its field research teams carry out a variety of tasks for the pmc each team consists of a test site manager a principal investigator a technical assistant an archivist and during the summer student assistants together they conduct the field greenhouse and growthchamber trials that determine pesticide efficacy crop tolerance to pesticides and for food crops especially the magnitude of pesticide residues these teams whose members must all have good laboratory practice training and certification as required by the pmra conduct about 350 such trials every year because theyre strategically located in farming communities across the country the team members are very much on the pmc s front lines and participate regularly in local grower meetings field days seminars tours and conferences by sharing their experiences among themselves and with the rest of the pmc they create an important forum for exchanging information and help keep the pmc s programs abreast of minorcrop issues in canada how it works the pmc holds a research planning meeting each january at which it assigns mupp trials to the nine research sites according to climatic conditions growing zones and the likelihood of pest occurrence this allows the research teams plenty of time to plan and refine the trial designs and protocols in cooperation with the project coordinators and study directors involved each site is responsible for at least 25 trials the principal investigators conduct most of these trials in the sites own experimental fields although others may be carried out on land belonging to growers collaborating with the pmc such collaboration provides the growers with firsthand knowledge of the mupp and gives the investigators an opportunity to work with them on the acreages where the pests are naturally active this improves the likelihood of achieving successful trials particularly in pesticide efficacy unity in diversity the research sites are located across all but one of canadas growing zones this diversity helps the pmc find places where the target pests are a particular problem which is also where the mupp trials will provide the most revealing data this variety of available environments has allowed the pmc to conduct most of its mupp trials inhouse on its own research sites despite the wide geographic distribution of the sites however the research teams are in continuous touch with pmc headquarters staff this regular communication is vital to the success of the trials because it ensures that the research teams are involved in activities such as experimental design pesticide application rates the selection of equipment and where necessary the controlled introduction of the target pests to the trial site since the mupp began in 2002 its research teams have completed more than 1300 trials and have contributed to new registrations that have made more than 395 additional minor uses of pesticides available in canada along the way theyve gained valuable experience with the various pests that affect canadian growers and its abundantly clear that theyre playing a pivotal role in the success of both the mupp and the pmc as youll see in the next article down in the valley about the busy mupp research site in kentville nova scotia down in the valley located at the eastern end of nova scotias lush annapolis valley the town of kentville has been an agricultural and business centre for almost two centuries and for nearly half that time its been home to an agricultural research station operated by the government of canada now called the atlantic food and horticulture research centre afhrc the station has 26 scientists and about 100 support staff and is one of nine research sites that contribute to the pmc s mupp in this capacity the research site conducts field and greenhouse trials to generate the data on pesticide residue efficacy and crop tolerance that is required to support the registration of pest control products atlantic food and horticulture research centre the minor use research team in kentville is composed of a test site manager a principal investigator a technician and an archivist julia reekie is the site manager and archivist and is responsible for overseeing program operations and maintaining site records principal investigator heather peill conducts the field trials collects data and compiles reports while research technician rick pineo assists with the trials and other researchrelated work during the summer the team also hires students from universities and technical colleges to help with the heavy workload of the growing season from left to right julia reekie heather peill and rick pineo each kentville project begins in january when the team members attend the pmc s annual research planning meeting in ottawa during the meeting the team helps select the 25 field trials theyll conduct over the coming months which are carried out on the 188hectare afhrc site on the nearby sheffield research farm or on privately owned fields that growers have offered for specific projects the kentville afhrc station is also equipped with greenhouses and controlledenvironment growth cabinets and some trials are conducted in these facilities since 2003 the team has carried out trials related to 53 projects dealing with pest control for many of the regions major crops which include lowbush blueberries nova scotias most valuable cash crop highbush blueberries apples pears strawberries broccoli carrots onions potatoes cauliflower and spinach of these projects 18 have dealt with weeds 14 with disease and 21 with insects some trials have assessed the effectiveness of a pesticide for controlling pest outbreaks in a crop others have ensured that the product is harmless to the crop being treated and still others have measured the amount of pesticide remaining in the crop after harvest like its eight sisters kentvilles mupp research site plays an indispensable role in adding new product uses to the antipest armoury of canadian growers in the capable hands of its research team those rows of young green plants neatly laid out under the blue annapolis valley sky are much more than blueberries carrots and cauliflower theyre a promise for the future bumblebee air delivery bumblebees as everybody knows have been perfectly equipped by millions of years of evolution to move pollen from flower to flower then why one might ask couldnt we arrange for them to work just a little harder and airdeliver some other substances as well the bumblebees wouldnt care and their extra labour might help the many greenhouse growers who use these peaceful little creatures to pollinate their crops the researchers who posed this question realized that bumblebees might make an ideal airborne delivery system for the microbial agents used in controlling greenhouse pests first the bumblebees would carry the agent only to the most vulnerable parts of the plant second bees are proverbially energetic which meant theyd deliver a continuous barrage of the agent to each plant thus targeting a pest throughout its life cycle to find out how well the method might work the pmc funded a pair of research projects that focused on two microbial agents used effectively with greenhouse tomatoes and sweet peppers these agents were the bioinsecticide botanigard®22wp beauveria bassiana which controls both whitefly in tomatoes and tarnished plant bug in sweet peppers and the inoculum endofine® clonostachys rosea which suppresses grey mold botrytis cinerea in the same two crops to load the bees with their microbial cargo the researchers attached wooden dispensers to the hives as the bees left home via the dispensers they were dusted with the agent which they then carried directly to the plants the trial results revealed that bee health was maintained b bassiana delivered by bumblebees suppressed whitefly and tarnished plant bug by approximately 50 to 70 percent bee leaving hive through biocontol dispenser further trials showed that the bees could successfully distribute two biocontrol agents at the same time for grey mold control c rosea was added to b bassiana in the dispensers the combination suppressed grey mold by 55 percent and whitefly and tarnished plant bug by 65 percent in all cases pollination was as successful when bees carried the bipcontrols with them as when they did not using bees to apply these agents is an alternative nonchemical method of pest control that can help greenhouse growers produce highquality tomatoes and sweet peppers in a sustainable way the approach is highly compatible with the integrated pest management programs commonly employed in greenhouses and minimizes effects among other beneficial insects used in greenhouse operations and the bumblebees would certainly approve because they like healthy plants at least as much as the greenhouse growers do entomological society of canada annual meeting representatives of the pmc attended the joint meeting of the entomological societies of canada and ontario at the crowne plaza hotel in ottawa on october 1922 2008 with more than 300 participants from canada and abroad the meeting covered diverse topics in insect ecology agriculture forestry systematics biodiversity and conservation with special emphasis on invasive species in canadian agroecosystems the meeting also celebrated 60 years of collaboration between canada and cab international in the field of biological control for the pmc s prrp marilyn dykstra delivered a presentation on strategy development with examples of research projects in agricultural entomology funded by the program for the pesticide minor use program shai benshalom presented a poster highlighting the numerous roles of the pmc from setting national priorities to submitting products for registration the poster also demonstrated the process of data generation by presenting the results of a successful efficacy trial conducted on strawberries by serge leblanc and his minor use team in bouctouche new brunswick other pmc employees also attended for part of the time to hear about the latest entomological advances and to network with other professionals in the field of insect pest management west coast perspectives audrey saparno is a project coordinator for the pmc s prrp in the summer of 2008 she spent several days at research sites in british columbia and sent us the following highlights of her visit as a pmc project coordinator i stay current with projects funded under our prrp usually through phone calls and electronic reports but i gain a further handson understanding of project challenges and accomplishments when i meet the project leads at the locations where the research is actually conducted that is why i was on the lower mainland of british columbia this past summer visiting three research sites and a commercial operation at agassiz abbotsford and langley just east of greater vancouver pacific agrifood research centre at agassiz at the agassiz site of aafc s pacific agrifood research centre dr bob vernon gave me an extensive overview of his current work to protect potato and wheat crops from wireworm current controls rely heavily on hazardous organophosphate pesticides that will eventually be withdrawn from use so dr vernon is developing alternative methods in anticipation of the phaseout as he led me through the rows of potatoes and stands of wheat that were the subjects of his experiments i was impressed by the enthusiasm that he and his team showed for these new controls in abbotsford dr janice elmhirst of elmhirst diagnostics gave me a tour of a raspberry fungicide screening trial and took me through two ornamental nurseries the raspberry trial is a project funded by the pmc as part of its efforts to identify products that show potential for controlling priority pests preliminary results look promising and show progress in identifying alternative fungicides for phytophthora root and crown rot as the main scout for van belles and nats nurseries dr elmhirst made a point of showing me the challenges of controlling pests and diseases in nursery establishments this is a highly complicated business because of the need to keep diverse species healthy at all stages of growth even in the nurseries limited spaces in langley i met with peter isaacson and dr deborah henderson at kwantlen university college both have been project leads for pesticide risk reduction projects and peter has recently completed a project to demonstrate how growers in the nursery sector can incorporate newly available biopesticides into their integrated pest management systems it was especially exciting to learn about the new research bioproduction facility the college is building which will be in operation by the spring of 2009 during my time in bc i was pleased to meet many project leads and to speak with commercial growers everyone expressed great pleasure at being able to show their work and facilities to a pmc staff member and for my part i gained a new and valuable perspective on the pest management issues that the prrp addresses through its funding the insights i gained on this visit have given me a better appreciation for the challenges faced by growers as well as new knowledge i can apply in developing practical reducedrisk pest management strategies north american free trade agreement technical working group on pesticides meeting with stakeholders the nafta technical working group on pesticides twg made up of pesticide regulators from the governments of mexico canada and the us was established in 1996 to address trade irritants and coordinate regulatory approaches on pesticides the twg meets semiannually to discuss pesticide issues in the nafta context once each year stakeholders are invited to meet with twg representatives from the three countries to hear about international efforts to harmonize regulations and to bring forward their areas of concern shirley archambault of the pmc is a participant in this twg which includes representatives from the us ir4 program as well at the november 2008 stakeholder meeting a focus was placed for the first time on biopesticides and on the issues associated with their successful integration into integrated pest management ipm systems a breakout session involving researchers crop protection companies growers and government personnel including pmc s biopesticide coordinator tobias längle was held to generate ideas to improve the adoption of biopesticides on farms tours of farms that use biopesticides in both ipm and organic growing systems were conducted for the meeting participants the pmc and its partners from the pmra the us ir4 program and the us environmental protection agency announced a new initiative to conduct cooperative biopesticide demonstration trials in canada and the us beginning in 2009 this approach which provides largescale demonstrations to familiarize growers with biopesticides was applauded by stakeholders who see grower uncertainty about how to use these new products as a key barrier to their more widespread adoption more information about the cooperative biopesticide trials will be provided in the next edition of the pmc newsletter regulatory submissions and registrations the process of registering a new minor use pesticide begins with the pmc s minor use pesticide program which prepares an information package based on data collected from field trials and laboratory analyses the package is then submitted to health canadas pmra to support the registration of the pesticide for a particular use the pmra reviews the package and decides whether the pesticide should be registered for this use in canada if registered the product can then be employed by growers as specified on the label the pmc s prrp also provides companies with assistance in submitting packages for registration of biopesticides provided that these products address

            "text": "If you happen to notice honey-coloured dots sprouting from the moist earth of a bean field, you might mistake them for some kind of inoffensive mushroom. But they're not mushrooms and they're far from inoffensive. They're a telltale sign of white mold infection, the scourge of carrot, canola and dry bean growers across Canada. A fungus called Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is the culprit behind the mold, which inflicts substantial damage on these important crops every year and places severe curbs on their sustainable production. 'Almost every bean field in southern Alberta has the fungus', says Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development's Dr. Ron Howard, who has been involved in white mold research for many years. \"In severe cases it can infect 60 to 70 percent of a crop and cut the yield in half, which can be devastating for a grower.\" There are three traditional ways of managing the disease: spraying the plants with fungicides when they're flowering; crop rotation away from susceptible crops to break the disease cycle; and, when they are available, using resistant cultivars of crops like dry bean. These approaches work best when used together, but unfortunately there is a diminishing number of fungicides available, a situation caused by the withdrawal of some products from the market and the phasing out of others. Industry, government and growers have consequently been looking for alternative controls for Sclerotinia rot in carrot, canola and dry bean crops. Ideally, such controls would be compatible with an integrated pest management strategy against the disease and would contribute to lowering pesticide risk. The need for new approaches was abundantly clear by 2003, and it was at this point that the Pesticide Risk Reduction Program (PRRP) entered the picture. The is a joint program of the Pest Management Centre (PMC) and the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA), and white mold control fell neatly under its mandate to design pesticide risk reduction strategies while improving growers' access to safer controls for specific crops. Coordinated by and partially funded through the , the various stakeholders, researchers and government specialists continued their efforts to address the problem. They focused on the three priority crops - dry beans, carrots, and canola - that have been targeted within the broader risk-reduction strategy for white mold. In 2006, the Dry Bean White Mold Working Group and the Carrot White Mold Working Group were set up under leadership, and, at the same time, the Canola Council of Canada established its own Canola Working Group as part of a larger pest-management approach for this particular crop. Clearing the Way for Contans One potential new control for the mold was the biopesticide Contans® WG, which European and growers had been using for several years. Its active ingredient is the fungus Coniothyrium minitans; when worked into the soil, this organism parasitizes and kills the soil-borne, overwintering bodies of the Sclerotinia fungus. However, Contans was not yet approved for use in Canada, so in 2006 the began funding the assessment of the product for white mold control and helped the company develop the data package required for registration. As a result, in June 2007 the submitted the Contans package to the for regulatory review. Progress since then has been brisk, especially with carrots. Preliminary field trial results, highlighting the benefits of Contans for this crop, have been presented to carrot growers, and publication of the related extension literature is on the way. On the dry bean and canola front, the and its partners in industry and the provinces have been equally busy. \"We've begun major demonstration trials with beans and canola in southern Alberta\", says Dr. Howard. \"They're the biggest trials of Contans ever done in Canada, and will be carried out over the next three years. Among other things, they'll demonstrate the best ways for growers to use the product - whether they should apply Contans the autumn before they plant a susceptible crop, for example, or whether it works better if they apply it to a currently infested field.\" Such speedy progress means that Contans should be commercially available to Canadian growers of carrots, beans and canola in early 2009, in plenty of time for the growing season. The product will likely be registered for several other crops at the same time, giving up to 11 new uses for this adaptable biopesticide. Biopesticides aren't the only controls under investigation. A new but surprisingly simple one is the carrot trimmer, a tractor-drawn implement developed with support by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's (AAFC) scientists at Harrington Research Farm in Prince Edward Island. The machine laterally trims the canopy leaves of several rows of carrots at a time, increasing airflow between the rows and leading to decreased soil moisture and higher air temperatures around the plants. This change in the canopy environment discourages the growth of Sclerotinia rot and reduces the need for fungicides while leaving yield unaffected. scientists in and the have been working hard to tell farmers about the trimmer and, as a result, at least two commercial farms - one in Nova Scotia, the other in the  - are already using it. Accurate, detailed information about white mold infection is a third anti-Sclerotinia weapon on which the has concentrated its efforts. To help growers spot the disease, estimate its severity and make informed control decisions, the Canola Council of Canada has produced the Canola Disease Identification and Sclerotinia Risk Assessment Card. The card was printed with funding and distributed during 2006-2007 to farmers, crop consultants and agri-dealers across the Prairies. All these approaches to white mold control have a common purpose, which is to become part of an integrated, reduced-risk strategy for controlling the disease. There is no single answer to the pest, but Contans, carrot trimming and advanced educational materials, among other tools, will provide growers with powerful new weapons against this old and dangerous enemy.\n\nMinor in Name but Not in Nature As any grower of low-acreage, high-value crops will tell you, stopping a pest in its tracks can spell the difference between a good year and a bad one. Insects and disease can hack big chunks out of a small operation's bottom line almost overnight, so growers of these \"minor crops\" - fruits, herbs, vegetables, nursery stock and landscaping plants, to name a few - are always looking for better ways to keep the pests at bay. Such crops are called \"minor\" not because they're of little value but because they're grown on small acreages, and they face the same pest management challenges as major crops. Manufacturers worldwide have developed a broad range of minor-crop pest-control products, which are in common use outside Canada, but many of these controls have remained beyond the reach of our growers since they've never been registered here. This is because Canada's minor-crop operations don't have the collective acreage to constitute a large enough pesticide market, so manufacturers haven't found it cost-effective to pursue Canadian registrations for many potentially useful products. Minor Use Pesticide Program to the Rescue The 's Minor Use Pesticide Program (MUPP) is helping to change all that. Through field trials carried out at its minor-use research sites, the generates data to support regulatory submissions to the , and by doing so encourages pesticide manufacturers to register their products for Canadian use. The is built on a foundation of nine research sites across Canada, where its field research teams carry out a variety of tasks for the . Each team consists of a test site manager, a principal investigator, a technical assistant, an archivist and, during the summer, student assistants. Together they conduct the field, greenhouse and growth-chamber trials that determine pesticide efficacy, crop tolerance to pesticides and, for food crops especially, the magnitude of pesticide residues. These teams, whose members must all have Good Laboratory Practice training and certification as required by the , conduct about 350 such trials every year. Because they're strategically located in farming communities across the country, the team members are very much on the 's front lines, and participate regularly in local grower meetings, field days, seminars, tours and conferences. By sharing their experiences among themselves and with the rest of the , they create an important forum for exchanging information and help keep the 's programs abreast of minor-crop issues in Canada. The holds a research planning meeting each January at which it assigns trials to the nine research sites according to climatic conditions, growing zones and the likelihood of pest occurrence. This allows the research teams plenty of time to plan and refine the trial designs and protocols in cooperation with the project coordinators and study directors involved. Each site is responsible for at least 25 trials. The principal investigators conduct most of these trials in the sites' own experimental fields, although others may be carried out on land belonging to growers collaborating with the . Such collaboration provides the growers with first-hand knowledge of the and gives the investigators an opportunity to work with them on the acreages where the pests are naturally active. This improves the likelihood of achieving successful trials, particularly in pesticide efficacy. The research sites are located across all but one of Canada's growing zones. This diversity helps the find places where the target pests are a particular problem, which is also where the trials will provide the most revealing data. This variety of available environments has allowed the to conduct most of its trials in-house, on its own research sites. Despite the wide geographic distribution of the sites, however, the research teams are in continuous touch with headquarters staff. This regular communication is vital to the success of the trials, because it ensures that the research teams are involved in activities such as experimental design, pesticide application rates, the selection of equipment and, where necessary, the controlled introduction of the target pests to the trial site. Since the began in 2002, its research teams have completed more than 1,300 trials and have contributed to new registrations that have made more than 395 additional minor uses of pesticides available in Canada. Along the way, they've gained valuable experience with the various pests that affect Canadian growers, and it's abundantly clear that they're playing a pivotal role in the success of both the and the  - as you'll see in the next article, \"Down in the Valley\", about the busy research site in Kentville, Nova Scotia.\n\nDown in the Valley Located at the eastern end of Nova Scotia's lush Annapolis Valley, the town of Kentville has been an agricultural and business centre for almost two centuries - and for nearly half that time it's been home to an agricultural research station operated by the Government of Canada. Now called the Atlantic Food and Horticulture Research Centre (AFHRC), the station has 26 scientists and about 100 support staff, and is one of nine research sites that contribute to the 's . In this capacity, the research site conducts field and greenhouse trials to generate the data on pesticide residue, efficacy and crop tolerance that is required to support the registration of pest control products. The minor use research team in Kentville is composed of a test site manager, a principal investigator, a technician and an archivist. Julia Reekie is the site manager and archivist and is responsible for overseeing program operations and maintaining site records. Principal investigator Heather Peill conducts the field trials, collects data and compiles reports, while research technician Rick Pineo assists with the trials and other research-related work. During the summer, the team also hires students from universities and technical colleges to help with the heavy workload of the growing season. From left to right: Julia Reekie, Heather Peill and Rick Pineo. Each Kentville project begins in January, when the team members attend the 's annual research planning meeting in Ottawa. During the meeting, the team helps select the 25 field trials they'll conduct over the coming months, which are carried out on the 188-hectare site, on the nearby Sheffield Research Farm or on privately owned fields that growers have offered for specific projects. The Kentville station is also equipped with greenhouses and controlled-environment growth cabinets, and some trials are conducted in these facilities. Since 2003, the team has carried out trials related to 53 projects dealing with pest control for many of the region's major crops, which include lowbush blueberries (Nova Scotia's most valuable cash crop), highbush blueberries, apples, pears, strawberries, broccoli, carrots, onions, potatoes, cauliflower and spinach. Of these projects, 18 have dealt with weeds, 14 with disease and 21 with insects. Some trials have assessed the effectiveness of a pesticide for controlling pest outbreaks in a crop, others have ensured that the product is harmless to the crop being treated, and still others have measured the amount of pesticide remaining in the crop after harvest. Like its eight sisters, Kentville's research site plays an indispensable role in adding new product uses to the anti-pest armoury of Canadian growers. In the capable hands of its research team, those rows of young green plants, neatly laid out under the blue Annapolis Valley sky, are much more than blueberries, carrots and cauliflower - they're a promise for the future.\n\nBumblebees, as everybody knows, have been perfectly equipped by millions of years of evolution to move pollen from flower to flower. Then why, one might ask, couldn't we arrange for them to work just a little harder and air-deliver some other substances as well? The bumblebees wouldn't care, and their extra labour might help the many greenhouse growers who use these peaceful little creatures to pollinate their crops. The researchers who posed this question realized that bumblebees might make an ideal airborne delivery system for the microbial agents used in controlling greenhouse pests. First, the bumblebees would carry the agent only to the most vulnerable parts of the plant. Second, bees are proverbially energetic, which meant they'd deliver a continuous barrage of the agent to each plant, thus targeting a pest throughout its life cycle. To find out how well the method might work, the funded a pair of research projects that focused on two microbial agents used effectively with greenhouse tomatoes and sweet peppers. These agents were the bioinsecticide BotaniGard®22WP (Beauveria bassiana), which controls both whitefly in tomatoes and tarnished plant bug in sweet peppers, and the inoculum EndoFine® (Clonostachys rosea), which suppresses grey mold (Botrytis cinerea) in the same two crops. To load the bees with their microbial cargo, the researchers attached wooden dispensers to the hives. As the bees left home via the dispensers they were dusted with the agent, which they then carried directly to the plants. The trial results revealed that bee health was maintained. B. bassiana delivered by bumblebees suppressed whitefly and tarnished plant bug by approximately 50 to 70 percent. Further trials showed that the bees could successfully distribute two biocontrol agents at the same time. For grey mold control, C. rosea was added to B. bassiana in the dispensers; the combination suppressed grey mold by 55 percent and whitefly and tarnished plant bug by 65 percent. In all cases, pollination was as successful when bees carried the bipcontrols with them as when they did not. Using bees to apply these agents is an alternative, non-chemical method of pest control that can help greenhouse growers produce high-quality tomatoes and sweet peppers in a sustainable way. The approach is highly compatible with the integrated pest management programs commonly employed in greenhouses, and minimizes effects among other beneficial insects used in greenhouse operations. And the bumblebees would certainly approve, because they like healthy plants at least as much as the greenhouse growers do.\n\nRepresentatives of the attended the Joint Meeting of the Entomological Societies of Canada and Ontario at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Ottawa on October 19-22, 2008. With more than 300 participants from Canada and abroad, the meeting covered diverse topics in insect ecology, agriculture, forestry, systematics, biodiversity and conservation, with special emphasis on invasive species in Canadian agro-ecosystems. The meeting also celebrated 60 years of collaboration between Canada and International in the field of biological control. For the 's , Marilyn Dykstra delivered a presentation on strategy development with examples of research projects in agricultural entomology funded by the Program. For the Pesticide Minor Use Program, Shai Ben-Shalom presented a poster highlighting the numerous roles of the , from setting national priorities to submitting products for registration. The poster also demonstrated the process of data generation by presenting the results of a successful efficacy trial conducted on strawberries by Serge LeBlanc and his Minor Use Team in Bouctouche, New Brunswick. Other employees also attended for part of the time, to hear about the latest entomological advances and to network with other professionals in the field of insect pest management.\n\nAudrey Saparno is a project coordinator for the 's . In the summer of 2008, she spent several days at research sites in British Columbia and sent us the following highlights of her visit. As a project coordinator, I stay current with projects funded under our , usually through phone calls and electronic reports. But I gain a further hands-on understanding of project challenges and accomplishments when I meet the project leads at the locations where the research is actually conducted. That is why I was on the lower mainland of British Columbia this past summer, visiting three research sites and a commercial operation at Agassiz, Abbotsford and Langley, just east of Greater Vancouver. At the Agassiz site of 's Pacific Agri-Food Research Centre, Dr. Bob Vernon gave me an extensive overview of his current work to protect potato and wheat crops from wireworm. Current controls rely heavily on hazardous organophosphate pesticides that will eventually be withdrawn from use, so Dr. Vernon is developing alternative methods in anticipation of the phase-out. As he led me through the rows of potatoes and stands of wheat that were the subjects of his experiments, I was impressed by the enthusiasm that he and his team showed for these new controls. In Abbotsford, Dr. Janice Elmhirst of Elmhirst Diagnostics gave me a tour of a raspberry fungicide screening trial and took me through two ornamental nurseries. The raspberry trial is a project funded by the as part of its efforts to identify products that show potential for controlling priority pests. Preliminary results look promising and show progress in identifying alternative fungicides for Phytophthora root and crown rot. As the main scout for Van Belle's and Nats Nurseries, Dr. Elmhirst made a point of showing me the challenges of controlling pests and diseases in nursery establishments; this is a highly complicated business because of the need to keep diverse species healthy at all stages of growth, even in the nurseries' limited spaces. In Langley, I met with Peter Isaacson and Dr. Deborah Henderson at Kwantlen University College. Both have been project leads for Pesticide Risk Reduction projects, and Peter has recently completed a project to demonstrate how growers in the nursery sector can incorporate newly available biopesticides into their integrated pest management systems. It was especially exciting to learn about the new research bioproduction facility the college is building, which will be in operation by the spring of 2009. During my time in , I was pleased to meet many project leads and to speak with commercial growers. Everyone expressed great pleasure at being able to show their work and facilities to a staff member and, for my part, I gained a new and valuable perspective on the pest management issues that the addresses through its funding. The insights I gained on this visit have given me a better appreciation for the challenges faced by growers, as well as new knowledge I can apply in developing practical, reduced-risk pest management strategies.\n\nThe Technical Working Group on Pesticides (TWG), made up of pesticide regulators from the governments of Mexico, Canada and the , was established in 1996 to address trade irritants and coordinate regulatory approaches on pesticides. The meets semi-annually to discuss pesticide issues in the context. Once each year, stakeholders are invited to meet with representatives from the three countries, to hear about international efforts to harmonize regulations and to bring forward their areas of concern. Shirley Archambault of the is a participant in this , which includes representatives from the -IR4 program as well. At the November 2008 stakeholder meeting, a focus was placed for the first time on biopesticides and on the issues associated with their successful integration into Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems. A breakout session involving researchers, crop protection companies, growers and government personnel, including 's Biopesticide Coordinator Tobias Längle, was held to generate ideas to improve the adoption of biopesticides on farms. Tours of farms that use biopesticides in both and organic growing systems were conducted for the meeting participants. The and its partners from the , the IR-4 program and the Environmental Protection Agency announced a new initiative to conduct cooperative biopesticide demonstration trials in Canada and the , beginning in 2009. This approach, which provides large-scale demonstrations to familiarize growers with biopesticides, was applauded by stakeholders who see grower uncertainty about how to use these new products as a key barrier to their more widespread adoption. More information about the cooperative biopesticide trials will be provided in the next edition of the Newsletter.\n\nThe process of registering a new minor use pesticide begins with the 's Minor Use Pesticide Program, which prepares an information package based on data collected from field trials and laboratory analyses. The package is then submitted to Health Canada's to support the registration of the pesticide for a particular use. The reviews the package and decides whether the pesticide should be registered for this use in Canada. If registered, the product can then be employed by growers as specified on the label. The 's also provides companies with assistance in submitting packages for registration of biopesticides, provided that these products address pesticide risk reduction priorities that have been identified in consultations with growers. \n\n\n\nKen Campbell has retired after 23  years of dedicated service with the . Ken was with the at its inception and then stepped into the research branch for two years; in 2005, he returned to the to fill his current role as special advisor. He also was 's acting Executive Director from October 2008 to January 2009. Ken brought a vast wealth of private- and public-sector experience to the . We will miss you, Ken, and we all wish you the very best for the future. Marcos Alvarez is acting as Executive Director of the until a permanent replacement is found. Within the , Ting Xie and Kendra Clark have joined as Quality Assurance (QA) Auditors and Shuhua Liu has accepted the position of Study Director.

Before joining the , he worked with Health Canada's as a senior scientific evaluator and has many years of experience in pesticide research and regulation. On the side, Tim MacDonald has returned from parental leave for his second child.\n\nAgriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) established the Pest Management Centre (PMC) in 2003 to implement the Pesticide Risk Reduction Program (PRRP) and Minor Use Pesticide Program (MUPP). The focuses on the development of risk reduction strategies for the Canadian agriculture and agri-food sector, while the responds to the needs of Canadian minor crop growers for increased access to new minor uses of pesticides. The operates from its headquarters in Ottawa and at nine research centres (Kentville, Nova Scotia; Bouctouche, New Brunswick; Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec; Vineland, Ontario; Delhi, Ontario; Harrow, Ontario; Scott, Saskatchewan; Summerland, British Columbia; and Agassiz, British Columbia) where field, greenhouse and growth chamber trials are conducted.

It analyzes how the dominant agricultural model can incorporate a feminist perspective and how the social movements that work towards food sovereignty can incorporate a feminist perspective.\n\nAfrican civil society organistions are calling for an immediate and complete ban on the growing, importing and exporting of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on the African continent. 'We call upon the governments of Africa to take the necessary steps to protect the health of their populations by supporting this call and commit to conducting independent and authoritative long-term food safety studies.' A petition can be signed online.\n\nExperts have called on governments and development organizations to put in place measures to significantly reduce the amount of food lost in the global food delivery chain. 'The amount of food lost along the food supply chain should be reduced as a way of reducing wastage within the food production system and also as a way dealing with global food insecurity,' Joseph Alcamo, chief scientist at the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), told IRIN.\n\nWorld grain reserves are so dangerously low that severe weather in the US or other food-exporting countries could trigger a hunger crisis next year. Failing harvests in the US, Ukraine and other countries this year have eroded reserves to their lowest level since 1974. The US, which has experienced record heatwaves and droughts in 2012, now holds in reserve a historically low 6.5% of the maize that it expects to consume in the next year, says the United Nations.\n\nSome 154 million people were reportedly driven further into poverty in Southern countries as a result of speculation-induced food price hikes in 2007-08. What are the best strategies for bringing about the structural change needed that progressive activists can lend their support to? asks this Corner House report. The workshop presentation, while endorsing regulatory measures including banning certain investment vehicles such as exchange-traded funds and vetting of derivative-based financial instruments, cautions against becoming focussed on regulation alone as an answer. Also crucial is the promotion of non-derivative, socially-based mechanisms to protect farmers and consumers from volatile food prices, as well as price interventions that do not pit Northern farmers against their Southern counterparts.\n\nThe number of people in need of humanitarian assistance between October 2012 and March 2013 in Malawi has jumped from 1.63 million to 1.76 million, but response plans remain inadequate and maybe exhausted be by November to December 2012. The new figure is contained in a report by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (Fewsnet), which provides an update on the food security conditions in Malawi from August 2012 through March 2013.\n\nWorld food prices rose in September and are seen remaining close to levels reached during the 2008 food crisis, the United Nations' food agency said, while cutting its forecast for global cereal output. The worst drought in more than 50 years in the United States sent corn and soybean prices to record highs over the summer, and, coupled with drought in Russia and other Black Sea exporting countries, raised fears of a renewed crisis.\n\n'According to the UN World Food Programme, there is enough food in the world for 12 billion people. If today people are still starving, then this is organized crime, mass murder. Every five seconds, one child under the age of ten dies, one billion people are permanently and heavily undernourished.' This is a quote from Jean Ziegler, who was until recently (2000-2008) the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, in an interview about a new book that he is published. Blog Africa is a Country has translated parts of the interview in their discussion about Ziegler and the book.\n\nInternational land investors and biofuel producers have taken over land around the world that could feed nearly 1 billion people. Analysis by Oxfam of several thousand land deals completed in the last decade shows that an area eight times the size of the UK has been left idle by speculators or is being used largely to grow biofuels for US or European vehicles.\n\nAfrican leaders should take note of the lessons learned from the Arab Spring and realise that ensuring good governance and food security will avoid crises on the continent, says Kofi Annan, chairman of the Africa Green Revolution Alliance. The former United Nations Secretary General said that food shortage was one of the triggers of the protests in North African and Middle-Eastern countries that lead to the ousting of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011 and Egypt’s President Hosni Mubarak in February that same year.\n\nEnvironmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria and Friends of the Earth International has warned against damaging industrial farming promoted by the Gates Foundation at the Agricultural Green Revolution Forum 2012, Arusha, Tanzania on 26-28 September. 'Donors controlling the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) are representing the interests of biotechnology corporations rather than African small farmers,' warns Friends of the Earth International on the eve of the annual AGRA Forum in Tanzania.\n\nThe French government has ordered an investigation into genetically-modified corn after a study found it was linked to cancer. France's government asked a health watchdog to carry out a probe, possibly leading to EU suspension of a genetically-modified corn, after a study in rats linked the grain to cancer.\n\nIn this briefing, the African Centre for Biodiversity (ACB) deal with the Pioneer/Pannar seed merger, outlining the evidence led by the ACB in opposing the merger, what is at stake for South Africa if the merger is approved and the extent to which the merger will deepen structural imbalances in the South African economy.\n\nLand used to power European cars with biofuels for one year could produce enough wheat and maize to feed 127 million people, Oxfam reveals ahead of today’s important EU Energy Ministers’ meeting. With the world’s poorest at greater risk of hunger as a result of spiraling food prices, the international agency is calling on the EU to rethink its dangerous love affair with biofuels. In a new GROW campaign report, 'The Hunger Grains', Oxfam warns that Europe’s growing appetite for biofuels is pushing up global food prices and driving people off their land, resulting in deeper hunger and malnutrition in poor countries.\n\nZambia must engage the public and other stakeholders before deciding whether to start accepting Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) or not, the country’s National Biosafety Authority (NBA) has said. NBA registrar Alfred Sumani said that the Zambian public and stakeholders need to be given balanced information on the merits and demerits of accepting GMOs into the country.\n\nWhat is the future of the Farm Input Subsidy Programme (FISP)? This was President Mutharika's flagship programme, which put Malawi on the forefront of international development debates and provided subsidies for seeds and fertiliser. Through the FISP, which was implemented against fierce donor resistance, Malawi was able to break free from a vicious cycle of hunger and food insecurity. This article from Africa Report examines whether the FISP will continue under new president Joyce Banda.\n\nA report on Monday said 1.63-million Malawians, out of a population of 13-million, would need food aid after crops failed in the south of the country, despite a bumper harvest of three-million tonnes nationwide. The study was conducted by the Malawi Vulnerability Assessment Committee, which comprises several government departments, the United Nations, embassies and humanitarian agencies. Only 200,000 people required food aid last year.\n\nPeople in the Swaziland lowveld have died of hunger, a member of the Swazi Parliament has reported. Nkululeko Mbhamali, Matsanjeni North MP, said hunger was rife in his constituency and some people had died at Tikhuba. Crops have failed this year due to poor rains. Mbhamali said a ‘food-for-work’ scheme organised by World Vision that was supposed to distribute food supplied by overseas’ donors had not been implemented properly and many people were not receiving food.\n\nIn a decision outraging campaigners for food sovereignty and agroecological approaches, the Gates Foundation has awarded a $10 million grant to develop genetically modified (GM) crops for use in sub-Saharan Africa. The grant is for the John Innes Centre in Norwich, which hopes to engineer seeds for corn, wheat and rice that will fix nitrogen (take nitrogen from the air) so that the crops would not need fertilizers. But GM Freeze, which campaigns against GM food, crops and patents, says that 'nitrogen fixing wheat and other cereals have been promised by the GM industry for several decades' and that other, non-GM methods are the solution. Pete Riley, campaign director GM Freeze, adds that 'GM is failing to deliver'.\n\nA new study from Earth Open Source called 'GMO Myths and Truths' - authored by two well known genetic engineers with help from an investigative reporter - conducted an exhaustive survey of hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific studies. The report concluded not only that GM food crops pose significant, if largely under-evaluated, health risks, but that they have so far failed to deliver on their promise to increase crop yields and lower herbicide and pesticide use.\n\nBiotech giant Syngenta has been criminally charged with denying knowledge that its genetically modified (GM) Bt corn kills livestock during a civil court case that ended in 2007. Syngenta’s Bt 176 corn variety expresses an insecticidal Bt toxin (Cry1Ab) derived from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and a gene conferring resistance to glufosinate herbicides. EU cultivation of Bt 176 was discontinued in 2007. Similar varieties however, including Bt 11 sweet corn are currently cultivated for human and animal consumption in the EU. The charges follow a long struggle for justice by a German farmer whose dairy cattle suffered mysterious illnesses and deaths after eating Bt 176.\n\nFive million Brazilian farmers are locked in a lawsuit with US-based biotech giant Monsanto, suing for as much as 6.2 billion euros. They say that the genetic-engineering company has been collecting royalties on crops it unfairly claims as its own. The farmers claim that Monsanto unfairly collects exorbitant profits every year worldwide on royalties from 'renewal' seed harvests.\n\nMalawi’s Farm Input Subsidy program, touted for improving food security for the past six years, has been allocated a whopping K40.6 billion in the 2012/13 budget which represents about 60 per cent of the Ministry of Agriculture allocation. 'The major allocation is for the Farm Inputs Subsidy Program (FISP) which has been allocated a total of K40.6 billion for the purchase of 150,000 metric tonnes of fertilizers comprising 75,000 metric tonnes of Urea and 75,000 metric tonnes of NPK fertilizers which will be distributed to 1.5 million farm families at a price of K500 per bag,' said Lipenga when he presented the financial plan.\n\nParts of the developing world, particularly India and countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, will suffer food shortages if their planned biofuels targets are implemented by 2020, a study has warned. The study, which looked at 25 countries and geographical regions, including Latin American and the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa and the United States, found that the targets will also affect national wealth.\n\nIndigenous foods, neglected and derided by many in the agro and food industries as well as urban consumers, can be an important component in alleviating hunger, malnutrition and protecting the environment, the regional representative for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations told a symposium. A century of globalization has reduced the number of plant species used for food and other purposes from roughly 100,000 to about 30. With the global population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, FAO is concerned that the world may not be able to produce enough food to meet demand. Today, an estimated 925 million people suffer from hunger and malnutrition, with over 60 percent of them residing in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nIn this Birthing Justice narrative, Nayeli Guzman, a young Mexican woman who went to New Mexico to be part of the effort to restore traditional agriculture, talks about how she and other farmers are using long-abandoned farmland to grow long-abandoned crops, building up seed libraries, and teaching others ecological methods for growing food. Birthing Justice: Women Creating Economic and Social Alternatives is a series features twelve alternative social and economic models which expand the possibilities for justice, equity, and strong community.\n\nProgressive small farmer organizations in Mexico scored a victory over transnational corporations that seek to monopolize seed and food patents. When the corporations pushed their bill to modify the Federal Law on Plant Varieties through the Committee on Agriculture and Livestock of the Mexican Chamber of Deputies on March 14, organizations of farmers from across the country sounded the alarm. By organizing quickly, they joined together to pressure legislators and achieved an agreement with the legislative committee to remove the bill from the floor.\n\nThe African Centre for Biosafety and Trust for Community Outreach and Education have released a new study which provides an overview of the structure of the seed system in South Africa, the types of seed in use and their pros and cons, the legislative and policy environment, and the role of the public sector in seed production and distribution in South Africa. It aims to identify the trends in the seed sector and consider possible points of intervention to advance the agenda of strengthening small-scale resource-poor farmers in control over and access to appropriate seed for seed sovereignty, which sits at the heart of food sovereignty.\n\nEverlyne Wanjiku, a single mother of five, has earned a living selling vegetables in the sprawling Kibera slum in Nairobi, Kenya, for over three decades. And even though her earnings were meagre, she was able to provide all her children with a tertiary education. But now, like her many fellow poverty-stricken slum dwellers in this East African nation, she is feeling the pinch of the high cost of food and other commodities, which have skyrocketed globally.\n\nThe South African government decided last week to draw attention of consumers that products they buy labeled “Made in Israel” could have been made in illegal Jewish settlements mushrooming the occupied Palestinian territories, a press release issued by the Popular Struggle Coordination Committee said. It said that after more than a year of joint work between Palestinian and South African organizations, South Africa’s Minister of Trade and Industry Rob Davies announced he will forbid false and misleading labeling of settlements products.",

engineered seeds―gets away with not having to label its products all you have to do is follow the trail of money leading from their coffers into the pockets and campaign funds of wellplaced politicians and regulators according to opensecretsorg 1 monsanto basically lives at the doorsteps of legislators in washington where it spent 53 million last year lobbying the nations lawmakers and has already spent 14 million in the first three months of this year needless to say they can afford it according to opensecretsorg monsanto had an annual revenue of 118 billion last year so a 53 million lobbying investment is far less than one percent of one percent of their revenues the influence theyre trying to buy doesnt stop in congress though monsantos legislative agenda also includes the us department of agriculture usda the food and drug administration fda and the environmental protection agency epa all of which have a say in whether or not you get to know whether the food youre eating has been genetically engineered can you trust a system powered by lobbying the power of monsanto can be seen through its contributions to rep frank d lucas whos received the most money so far from monsanto lucas just happens to be chairman of the house agriculture committee through which every farmrelated piece of legislation must pass but hes certainly not the only one wheel getting greased by this biotech giant according to opensecretsorg so far this election cycle monsantos pac has given 77500 to 17 members of the house agriculture committee or their leadership pacs monsantos interests in washington are diverse it lobbied bills ranging from the american research and competitiveness act of 2011 2 which would extend tax credits for companies doing research to several bills that would change the way the department of homeland security handles security at chemical facilities chemicals being a big part of monsantos product portfolio another upcoming matter of great interest to monsanto the new farm bill an omnibus piece of legislation that sets the nations agricultural policy and deals with nearly every aspect of the countrys farming and food industries the current bill expires in 2013 when it went through congress monsanto filed more lobbying reports on it than any other organization the process of piecing together a new proposal is already well under way such lobbying efforts can and do have a tremendous impact on the lives and health of every american not to mention the environment it directly impacts the food you end up with on your plate and whether or not youre allowed to know whats in the food you eat to begin with monsanto and other biotech companies involved with genetic engineering of crop seeds are currently fighting tooth and nail to prevent labeling of genetically engineered foods knowing full well that such a label has the potential to destroy their burgeoning industry why monsanto always wins last year monsanto lobbied congress and the us department of agriculture concerning regulations that would affect genetically engineered crops such as the companys roundup ready soybeans and alfalfa as a result genetically engineered alfalfa was deregulated despite strong opposition from the organic industry and massive public outcry an interesting article from last year by mike ludwig titled why monsanto always wins sheds light on the shady approval process of genetically engineered crops 3 according to ludwig theres evidence of cooperation between federal regulators and the biotech industry that crosses the line of acceptable involvement during the regulatory review he also cites bill freese a policy analyst with cfs who told truthout that the approval process for controversial genetically engineered ge crops like roundup ready alfalfa is basically a sham designed to increase consumer confidence in the controversial ge crops and that in his years of battling against biotech he cant remember a single case when regulators failed to eventually grant approval of a ge crop to get an idea of just how broad and deep monsantos reach is take a look at the following chart over the years this biotech giant has successfully infiltrated an ever increasing number of highlevel federal regulatory positions in the us government many of which are positions meant to protect your food safety crazy patent laws prevent independent researchers from studying ge hazards to give you another example of how monsanto has been able to carefully position itself and its wares into a nearinvincible position consider this the reason why genetically engineered food hazards have never been studied beyond 30 days nor are currently being studied is because the corporations controlling the patented seeds such as monsanto are allowed to prevent independent studies per current patent laws thats right genetically engineered foods are patented inventions protected under copyright and proprietary information laws and the corporations controlling the seeds only allow them to be studied under very limited conditions and rarely if ever do they permit them to be studied for safety by anyone but the usda—which conveniently has not yet seen the need to conduct rigorous longterm safety studies on genetically engineered foods 4 how monsanto is now positioned to potentially decimate africa monsantos political influence clearly reaches far beyond our us borders most recently in an effort to end hunger in africa the obama administration drafted some of the worlds largest food and finance companies to invest in projects all over the continent 5 much of the 3 billion effort will go toward developing seeds and fertilizers and building silos for storage to do this the president has rounded up the usual suspects which includes monsanto however unlike the us some donor countries are insisting that their money be spent on traditional food handouts instead of genetically engineered monoculture such as that offered by tanseed a tanzanian seed company that will spend 11 million buying certified seed to be sold in little packets to small farmers still the evidence tells us genetically engineered crops can not coexist with organic or conventional crops they usually end up contaminating nearby fields turning those farmers into patentinfringing criminals in the process—a scenario no farmer on any continent could ever have imagined a couple of decades ago another project seeking to establish genetically engineered crops in africa is the alliance for a green revolution in africa agra through this alliance heavyweights like monsanto and other biotech companies along with the gates foundation are foolishly promoting ge crops as the answer to africas hunger problem but donating patented seeds which takes away the farmers sovereignty is not the way to save the thirdworld poor the gates foundation has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to agra and in 2006 robert horsch was hired for the project horsch was a monsanto executive for 25 years in a nutshell the project may be sold under the banner of altruism and sustainability but in reality its anything but its just a multibillion dollar enterprise to transform africa into a gecropfriendly continent in the end such humanitarian efforts are doomed to fail while allowing big biotech to make obscene profits at the poors expense african farmers will likely encounter the same problems as those in india where farmers growing genetically engineered crops have been committing suicide due to financial hardships at a rate of one farmer taking his own life every 30 minutes brazilian farmers sue monsanto for unfair and exorbitant profits a recent lawsuit against monsanto by brazilian farmers also highlights the harsh economic realities for farmers who take up growing genetically engineered crops according to a recent rt news article 6 five million brazilian farmers are locked in a lawsuit with usbased biotech giant monsanto suing for as much as 62 billion euros the farmers claim that monsanto unfairly collects exorbitant profits every year worldwide on royalties from renewal seed harvests renewal crops are those that have been planted using seed from the previous years harvest while the practice of renewal farming is an ancient one monsanto disagrees demanding royalties from any crop generation produced from its geneticallyengineered seed because the engineered seed is patented monsanto not only charges an initial royalty on the sale of the crop produced but a continuing 2 per cent royalty on every subsequent crop even if the farmer is using a later generation of seed monsanto gets paid when it sell the seeds the law gives producers the right to multiply the seeds they buy and nowhere in the world is there a requirement to pay again producers are in effect paying a private tax on production jane berwanger lawyer for the farmers told the associated press reports in the latest installment of the legal battle erupting in south america the brazilian court has ruled in favor of the brazilian farmers saying monsanto owes them at least us2 billion paid since 2004 monsanto however has appealed the decision and the case is ongoing in essence monsanto argues that once a farmer buys their seed they have to pay the global biotech giant a yearly fee in perpetuity – with no way out why we need labeling of genetically engineered foods in the us labeling genetically engineered foods is likely the best shot we have at circumventing monsantos powergrabbing ways and stopping the unchecked proliferation of genetically engineered foods this is why we strongly support state initiatives such as californias 2012 ballot initiative to require genetically engineered foods sold in the state to be labeled as consumers we all have a right to know whats in our food this is a powerful strategy that could have the impact of a national law why because large food companies are unlikely to have dual labeling one for california and another for the rest of the country it would be very expensive not to mention a logistical and pr nightmare to avoid the dual labeling many would likely opt to ditch genetically engineered ingredients from their products entirely this is why supporting this initiative is so important as victory in california will likely eliminate most genetically engineered foods from the rest of the us as well powerful confirmation of this belief occurred earlier this year when both cocacola company and pepsico inc chose to alter one of their soda ingredients as a result of californias labeling requirements for carcinogens 7 this is a perfect example of the national impact a california ge labeling requirement can and no doubt will have while california is the only state requiring the label to state that the product contains the offending ingredient these companies are switching their formula for the entire us market rather than have two different labels cocacola co and pepsico inc are changing the way they make the caramel coloring used in their sodas as a result of a california law that mandates drinks containing a certain level of carcinogens bear a cancer warning label the companies said the changes will be expanded nationally to streamline their manufacturing processes theyve already been made for drinks sold in california aaem recommends gmo free diet as you may recall two years ago the american academy of environmental medicine aaem called on all physicians to prescribe diets without genetically engineered foods to all patients 8 but youd be hardpressed to find a doctor who is aware of andor actually follows this recommendation at that time the aaem called for a moratorium on genetically engineered foods longterm independent studies and labeling stating several animal studies indicate serious health risks associated with gm food including infertility immune problems accelerated aging insulin regulation and changes in major organs and the gastrointestinal system there is more than a casual association between genetically modified foods and adverse health effects there is causation learn more about genetically engineered foods due to lack of labeling many americans are still unfamiliar with what genetically engineered foods are we have a plan to change that and i urge you to participate and to continue learning more about genetically engineered foods and helping your friends and family do the same your best strategy is to simply buy usda 100 organic products whenever possible as these do not permit genetically engineered ingredients or buy whole fresh produce and meat from local farmers the majority of the genetically engineered organisms gmos youre exposed to are via processed foods so by cooking from scratch with whole foods you can be sure youre not inadvertently consuming something laced with altered ingredients when you do purchase processed food avoid products containing anything related to corn or soy that are not usda certified to be 100 percent organic as any foods containing these two nonorganic ingredients are almost guaranteed to contain genetically engineered ingredients as well as toxic herbicide residues to learn more about genetically engineered foods i highly recommend perusing the many videos and lectures available on the irt site",

This is why we strongly support state initiatives, such as California's 2012 ballot initiative to require genetically engineered foods sold in the state to be labeled. As consumers, we all have a right to know what's in our food. This is a powerful strategy that could have the impact of a national law. Because large food companies are unlikely to have dual labeling; one for California and another for the rest of the country. It would be very expensive, not to mention a logistical and PR nightmare. To avoid the dual labeling, many would likely opt to ditch genetically engineered ingredients from their products entirely. \n\n \n\n This is why supporting this initiative is so important, as victory in California will likely eliminate most genetically engineered foods from the rest of the U.S. as well. Powerful confirmation of this belief occurred earlier this year, when both Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo Inc. chose to alter one of their soda ingredients as a result of California's labeling requirements for carcinogens7. This is a PERFECT example of the national impact a California GE labeling requirement can, and no doubt WILL, have. While California is the only state requiring the label to state that the product contains the offending ingredient, these companies are switching their formula for the entire US market, rather than have two different labels: \"Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. are changing the way they make the caramel coloring used in their sodas as a result of a California law that mandates drinks containing a certain level of carcinogens bear a cancer warning label. The companies said the changes will be expanded nationally to streamline their manufacturing processes. They've already been made for drinks sold in California.\"",

            "text": "Most of us have a time bomb nestled inside our nerve cells, waiting for our immune system to falter in the face of age or disease.\n\nIf you’ve had chicken pox, you’re at risk for shingles – a painful nerve disorder that can make the slightest breeze or touch excruciating. People over the age of 80 have a one in five chance of being affected, and every passing year increases the risk.\n\nThere may be hope on the horizon, though. Medical center researchers have developed the first animal model to study how the culprit, the varicella-zoster virus, negotiates an uneasy truce with our nerve cells that can last for decades after the spotty childhood rash fades.\n\nFurther research may allow the scientists to modify an existing vaccine to make it less likely to spark a shingles flare-up, or even to improve the shingle-free odds of those of us already playing unwilling hosts to the virus.\n\nUntil now, research has been hampered by the fact that the virus is especially picky in its choice of hosts: holding out for real human nerve cells rather than settling for those of any garden-variety research animal. Those in a culture dish weren’t up to the task of mimicking an ongoing infection, either.\n\nThen Stanford scientists, led by pathology professor Irving Weissman, MD, devised a way to incorporate human nerve cells into the brains of mice.\n\n“We can now see the behavior of the virus in human neurons for the first time,” said Ann Arvin, MD, chief of pediatric infectious disease at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital and professor of pediatrics and of microbiology and immunology.\n\nArvin is the senior author of the research, which was published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in early July.\n\nThe double whammy dished out by varicella-zoster virus makes it particularly important to understand the give-and-take between virus and host.\n\nAlthough a modified, weakened version of the virus has been developed to protect healthy children against full-blown chicken pox, the vaccination can sometimes cause later episodes of shingles in children whose immune systems are compromised by cancer or organ transplantation. The risk of reactivation, however, is lower for vaccinated children than for those who were naturally infected with the wild-type virus.\n\n“We can use this model to understand which viral genes are important for infecting neurons,” said Arvin. “If we can get rid of those genes in the virus used for the vaccine, we might be able to prevent reactivation.”\n\nThe researchers found that, as expected, the weakened virus used for the vaccine was capable of infecting the human neurons in the brains of the mice.\n\nOnce established, both the wild type and the vaccine version of the virus can also spread between neurons.\n\n“We found that if the virus got into one cell, it seems to be able to infect nearby cells, presumably increasing its chances of reactivation,” said Arvin, who holds the Lucile Salter Packard Professorship in Pediatrics.\n\n“It also behaves very differently in neurons than it does in skin cells: in skin it destroys the cells, whereas in neurons it seems to set up a kind of infection that allows it to persist for the lifetime of the individual,” she added.\n\nThe fact that the mice used in the study have non-functioning immune systems is also telling. It was previously thought that a robust immune response was the key to preventing an attack of shingles immediately after infection.\n\n“Clearly all of this is taking place without any of the usual types of active immune responses,” said Arvin. “These findings suggest that the neuron itself has a way of accommodating the virus – a kind of temporarily mutually beneficial relationship that allows the neuron to escape destruction even while the virus persists.”",

            "text": "Scientists have built a virus from scratch in only two weeks. Their new technique paves the way for synthetic viruses and bacteria, but stirs concerns over biological weapons and the environment.\n\nThe virus was created by genome sequencing pioneer Craig Venter and his team at the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives in Rockville, Maryland, and revealed at a press conference yesterday.\n\nIt is the second virus to be synthesized from commercially available ingredients. The first - a poliovirus completed by Eckard Wimmer and his colleagues in 2002 - took three years to make. \"If we had to do it over, I would use [Venter's] method,\" says Wimmer, who works at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.\n\nVenter's team cobbled together the virus, called phi-X174, following its published genetic sequence. They stitched up its DNA from ready-made overlapping fragments called oligonucleotides, each built from 40 chemical building-blocks, or bases.\n\nThe smart part, according to Wimmer, involved steps that eliminated genetic errors. For example, the team filtered out common oligonucleotides that harbour genetic mutations.\n\nThe team used enzymes to glue the oligonucleotides together accurately into the complete 5,386-base genetic strand, and to copy it many times. When the synthetic viral genome was injected into bacteria, the bacterial cell's machinery read the instructions and created fully fledged viruses.\n\nGenetically, one of the resulting virus strains was 100% identical to the natural virus, says Venter. By contrast, Wimmer's polioviruses, which were some 7,500 bases long, had to be laboriously checked for mistakes as each genetic piece was added.\n\nThe new method is a step towards a bigger goal, claim Venter and members of the US Department of Energy, which is funding the work - namely, building designer bacteria that can pump out hydrogen fuel or gobble up greenhouse gases.\n\nThey want to mix and match genes from various organisms to make cellular genomes at least 300,000 bases long. The technique will need some refining first. For example, a cell might be unable to turn more complicated DNA into a working organism without the addition of key proteins.\n\nThe study may revive concerns that such techniques could one day be hijacked to make pathogens such as polio or even smallpox for bioweapons. This was widely discussed following the publication of Wimmer's work. The prospect of synthetic viruses or bacteria also raises fears about their possible environmental impact.\n\n\"It reminds us that we'll continue to confront these issues in an accelerating way,\" says public-health expert Stephen Morse of Columbia University, New York City. Now, as then, Morse and others argue that the benefits of the new technique outweigh the risks and that the method should be made public.\n\nThe details of the manufacture of virus phi-X174 will be published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in three weeks1.",

            "text": "Researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center report the identification of a new cellular source for an important disease-fighting protein used in the body's earliest response to infection.\n\nThe protein interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) keeps viruses from replicating and stimulates the immune system to produce other disease-fighting agents. Neutrophils, the newly identified cellular source of the protein, are the major component of the pus that forms around injured tissue.\n\nThe researchers also report that the neutrophils appear to produce IFN-γ through a new cellular pathway independent of Toll-like receptors (TLRs): the body's early warning system for invasion by pathogens. This finding indicates that mammals might possess a second early-alert system -- the sort of built-in redundancy engineers would envy, said Dr. Felix Yarovinsky, assistant professor of immunology and senior author of the study published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in June.\n\n\"We believe our mouse study provides strong evidence that neutrophils, white blood cells created in the bone marrow, produce significant amounts of IFN-γ in response to disease,\" Dr. Yarovinsky said. \"The finding of a new and essential cellular source for IFN-γ challenges a long-held belief in the field and is significant because neutrophils are the most common kind of white blood cell.\"\n\nTwo pathogens were used in this study: the parasite Toxoplasma gondii -- which can cause brain damage in humans and other mammals that have compromised immune systems -- and a type of bacterium that causes gastroenteritis, Salmonella typhimurium.\n\nInnate immunity is the body's first line of defense against pathogens, including those that it has never before encountered. Adaptive immunity is the secondary system that battles pathogens to which the body has previously been exposed and to which it has developed antibodies.\n\nTextbooks list natural killer (NK) cells and T cells as the body's significant sources of IFN-γ. Although large numbers of neutrophils have long been observed to congregate at the site of a new infection, they were commonly thought to be first responders or foot soldiers rather than generals in the battle against disease, as this study indicates they are, Dr. Yarovinsky explained.\n\nAbout 20 years ago, there were clinical reports in humans and animals suggesting that neutrophils might produce IFN-γ, but the idea was largely ignored by the scientific community until the last decade, he said.\n\nSince then, studies at UT Southwestern and elsewhere have found that mice lacking NK and T cells, and therefore expected to be unable to produce IFN-γ, somehow continued to withstand infections better than mice genetically unable to make any IFN-γ. These observations suggested the possibility of an unknown source of the protein, he explained.\n\nIn a series of experiments, the UT Southwestern researchers identified neutrophils as the major source of IFN-γ in mice lacking NK and T cells. \"Based on what we know about neutrophils, their large numbers and rapid deployment to the site of infection should provide an important means of very early, robust, and rapid elimination of disease-causing agents,\" the researchers wrote. Although neutrophil-derived IFN-γ alone is insufficient to achieve complete host protection, the protein significantly extended the survival of mice in this study, Dr. Yarovinsky said.\n\nIn related news, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund in June announced that Dr. Yarovinsky had been selected for its 2013 Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease Award to further investigate mechanisms of host defense against various infectious diseases mediated by IFN-γ produced by neutrophils. The award will provide $500,000 over five years to pursue this line of research.\n\nOthers involved include first author Carolyn Sturge, a graduate student of immunology; former research assistant Alicia Benson; research assistant II Megan Raetz; graduate student Cara L. Wilhelm; Dr. Julie Mirpuri, assistant professor of pediatrics; and Cancer Immunobiology Center Director Dr. Ellen Vitetta, professor of immunology and of microbiology.\n\nFunding was provided by the National Institutes of Health and the Burroughs Wellcome Foundation.",

It doesn’t help that the four agro companies didn’t give clear instructions to the farmers, he added. Aprosoja hopes to reach a negotiated agreement with the seed companies, but if all else fails farmers may sue to get reparations for pesticide costs, according to Tomczyk.\n\n“Monsanto, et al are unlikely to accommodate the farmers,” according to an article by CommonDreams.org. Instead, their response is likely to be further seed modifications and increased use of pesticides that these companies also produce, regardless of environmental or financial impact..\n\n“Industry tries to tackle this issue by commercialization of so called ‘stacked events’ that produce several different Bt toxins,”GM Watch wrote. “The best known example is Monsanto's SmartStax maize that produces six different Bt toxins.”\n\nPreviously, 5 million Brazilian soybean farmers sued US-based Monsanto, claiming the genetic-engineering company was collecting royalties on crops it unfairly claims as its own. In 2012, the Brazilian court ruled in favor of the Brazilian farmers, saying Monsanto owes them at least US $2 billion paid since 2004. The biotech giant promised to appeal, and reached an agreement with the farmers last August to end the litigation, Reuters reported at the time.\n\nIn exchange for dropping the suit, Monsanto agreed to lower the price on a new type of genetically modified soybean ‒ not the older RR1 version the case was based on ‒ that the farmers were encouraged to purchase and plant in eight percent of Brazilian fields. Aprosoja represented the plaintiffs in that case as well.\n\nBut in October, a judge in that country blocked Monsanto’s attempt to make farmers sign restrictive agreements before being able to purchase the new RR2 Intacta soybean seeds. In December, the soybean farmers again sued the GMO company for about US $1 billion for illegally collecting royalties on the old RR1 seeds and forcing the Brazilians to sign “abusive” purchase contracts for the new ones, according to Sustainable Pulse.\n\nBrazil is harvesting its second of two annual corn crops and expects to produce 78 million tonnes this crop year, slightly less than last season's record. Domestic prices recently fell to their lowest in four years because of abundant supplies, Reuters reported.",

Researchers in Iowa found significant damage from rootworms in corn fields last year.\n\nIn Brazil, the main corn culprit is Spodoptera frugiperda, also known as the corn leafworm or southern grassworm.\n\nSeed companies say they warned Brazilian farmers to plant part of their corn fields with conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to GMO seeds.\n\nDow Agrosciences, a division of Dow Chemical Company, has programs in Brazil to help corn farmers develop \"an integrated pest management system that includes, among other things, the cultivation of refuge areas,\" it said in an email.\n\nAnother company, DuPont, said it had not received any formal notification from Aprosoja. The company's Pioneer brand has been working with producers to extend the durability of its seed technology and improve efficiency since Spodoptera worms were found to have developed resistance to the Cry1F protein, it said in a statement.\n\nThe other two companies, Monsanto Co and Syngenta AG did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nTomczyk, who also spoke for Brazilian farmers during a dispute over seed royalty payments to Monsanto that ended last year, said Aprosoja encouraged the planting of refuge areas. But he said the seed companies have not given clear instructions.\n\n\"There are barely any non-GMO seeds available ... it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers,\" he said. Aprosoja hopes to reach a negotiated agreement with the seed companies, but if all else fails farmers may sue to get reparations for pesticide costs, he added.\n\nBrazil is harvesting its second of two annual corn crops and expects to produce 78 million tonnes this crop year, slightly less than last season's record.

            "text": "Genetically modified corn, which produces anti-pest toxin, is no longer as efficient at killing the bugs. The resistance arose quickly, due to some extent, to farmers avoiding the simple, but profit-cutting precaution of crop rotation.\n\nThe problem that may soon render null the economic and environmental benefits of GM maize, which produces the so-called Bacillus thurinigiensis (Bt) toxin, was highlighted in a study published online in this week’s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n\n\n\n In the paper, a team led by Aaron Gassmann, an entomologist at Iowa State University in Ames, described the rise in some Iowa fields of a bug called the western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera). \n\n\n\n The studied pest has developed resistance to two of three types of Bt toxins currently available on the market. \n\n\n\n The vulnerability of GM corn could lead to disastrous consequences for farmers and the environment, Gassmann warned. \n\n\n\n “Unless management practices change, it’s only going to get worse,” he said. “There needs to be a fundamental change in how the technology is used.” \n\n\n\n The US authorized use of Bt toxin-producing corn back in 2003. Since then the GM plants, which were believed not to require implementation of insecticides to combat rootworms and other pests, has dominated the market and currently accounts for three-quarters of the American corn crop. \n\n\n\n However, the first cases of rootworm damage to GM plants were registered in 2009, with corn containing Cry3Bb1 Bt toxin being affected. \n\n\n\n Two years later, the bugs started attacking the fields, at which the second toxin – mCry3A – was used by the farmers. \n\n\n\n The lab tests performed by Gassmann and his team have revealed that a case of cross-resistance is in place as the pests that had become resistant to Cry3Bb1 were also resistant to mCry3A. \n\n\n\n The most likely explanation to the phenomenon is that both toxins share structural similarities and some binding sites in the insect’s gut, the paper said. \n\n\n\n According to the research, the Bt corn simply doesn’t produce enough toxin to fully control the rootworms, who are known as really tough creatures. \n\n\n\n Unlike the majority of other pests, which are almost completely defenseless against the toxins, over 2 percent of the rootworms can survive contact with Bt maize. \n\n\n\n Resistance in the worms can develop very fast in fields where the same kind of maize is being grown every year. In Iowa, it showed up after an average of 3.6 years, the paper warns. \n\n\n\n Agricultural biotechnology companies currently apply the so-called ‘pyramiding’ technology to their seeds so that they can produce two different Bt toxins, with one of them being Cry34/35Ab1 that so far has not seen any resistance developed by the rootworms. \n\n\n\n Gassmann confirmed that the pyramiding of toxins is an important way to delay the development of resistance, but added that the combination becomes less effective once resistance arises to one of the toxins. \n\n\n\n So, while relying on technology, the farmers shouldn’t forget about such old-fashioned practices as crops rotation as it helps disrupt the pests life cycle. \n\n\n\n “The rootworm can’t survive if the corn’s not there,” he explained.",

            "text": "\"”Who Stole the Cookie from the Cookie Jar?” or the Cookie Jar Song is a sing-along song/game, sung usually with young children in a pre-school, school, or day camp setting. The song is an infinite-loop motif, each verse directly feeds into the next. It is usually performed as a fun game, with the children sitting or standing in a circle.\n\n \n\n The song usually begins with the group leader asking who stole a cookie from an apocryphal (or, in some cases, real) cookie jar, followed by the name of one of the children in the circle. The child questions the “accusation,” answered by an affirmation from the “accuser,” followed by continued denial from the “accused.” The accuser asks who stole the cookie, followed by the name of another child in the circle. The call-and-answer is potentially infinitely recursive, limited only by the number of participants or the amount of time the participants wish to spend on it.\n\n \n\n Sometimes, a clapping or snapping beat is used by the children in the circle. Sometimes, the other children in the group sing along with the “accuser” after the “accused” has been identified. Some variations on the theme include the use by teachers of the song as a lesson in keeping with a beat and improvisation. As with many children’s songs, there can be many variations on the execution of the performance.\n\n \n\n The song’s lyrics are usually:\n\n \n\n Accuser: Who stole the cookie from the cookie jar?\n\n (name of a child in the circle) stole the cookie from the cookie jar.\n\n Accused: Who, me?\n\n Accuser/Group: Yes, you!\n\n Accused: Not me!/Couldn’t be!/Wasn’t me!\n\n Accuser/Group: Then who?\n\n \n\n This is followed by the “accused” saying the name of someone else, as “(name of a child in the circle) stole the cookie from the cookie jar,” and the subsequent back-and-forth lines are repeated. The song may be repeated ad infinitum or it may end – if it is being performed as part of a game, where members of the group are eliminated by failing to keep up with the prescribed beat or eliminated as a result of being chosen as one of the accused.\n\n \n\n The song, and game, is featured as one of the sequences in Grandpa’s Magical Toys; the only accusation that is missing is that of the Dutch Girl, and she reveals that she got all the toys and the last cookie.\n\n \n\n A variation of the song has been used in Smart4life commercials in the US beginning in 2009\".",

insight into the development of any tissue in the body including liver brain blood and others a stem cell has the potential to become any type of cell a uwled research team was particularly interested

degree in murrys lab the results are published in the sept 28 edition of cell paige an aspiring pediatric cardiologist said by identifying regulators of cardiac development this work has the potential to lead to a better understanding of the causes of congenital heart disease thereby paving the way for therapeutic advances previously uw researchers had examined the signals that lead cells to grow into various kinds of heart tissue in this case the researchers entered a relatively unexplored area they decided to look at the genetic controls behind the transformation of stem cells into heart tissue because stem cells keep their dna code unrevealed until needed the scientists examined how this packaging is altered over time to permit reading of portions of the code and thereby produce changes in the cell the researchers pointed out that it was already known that the patterns that stem cells follow to modify their dna packaging distinguished them from progenitor cells—cells prepared to begin a lineage of a particular type of cell—and also from cells that already had a working identity such as blood or muscle cells however the dynamics of the dna packaging modifications—how the packaging is programmed to change over time—and how these dynamics influence which genes are exposed and activated to create for example heart muscle cells were poorly understood the uwled research team learned that as human embryonic stem cells become heart cells this differentiation is accompanied by distinctive dynamic alterations in dna packaging this telltale pattern enabled the scientists to distinguish the key regulators of heart development from other genes read more in uw today duplexsequencing method could lead to better cancer detection and treatment the simple idea of two young

pinpoint which cells are mutating this improvement could lead to early diagnosis of cancer and a better treatment plan once researchers knew which cells were resistant to chemotherapy the idea was to sequence both strands of dna if researchers saw a mutation in one strand but not the other they would recognize it as error from sequencing and not a true mutation their results published online in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences in august are getting wide accolades if its power is confirmed duplex sequencing will likely improve our understanding of the clonal substructure of

            "text": "It is a pleasure to announce the completion and opening of the Montlake Tower expansion of UW Medical Center. This 273,000-square-foot, eight-story addition to UW Medical Center’s south side strongly enhances UW Medicine’s ability to provide outstanding healthcare. The $210 million project, under construction since 2009, features a 50-bed neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), a 30-bed unit for oncology patients, additional MRI and CT scanners, and state-of-the-art interventional radiology and hybrid procedure rooms. Oncology, radiology and the NICU each have a floor in the tower; two other floors will serve computer-service functions and three floors are slated for future clinical use. More detailed information and videos about the new units are available on the UWMC Montlake Tower Expansion webpage. For those of you who have not yet seen the Tower, staff and faculty are invited to tour the new facility on Friday, Oct. 5, from 7-9 a.m., 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 5-7 p.m. A community open house will be held on Saturday, Oct. 6, 10 to noon. The Montlake Tower has spacious patient rooms and work areas, beautiful views, and natural and custom lighting. In the planning process, the recommendations of a 2010 energy-reduction study by the UW’s Integrated Design Lab and a consortium of architects, engineers and construction companies were considered. The Montlake Tower is one of the most energy-efficient hospital additions in the Pacific Northwest, outperforming Seattle’s energy code by almost 30 percent. By employing LED lighting, solar shading and other recommendations, this “green building” will save approximately $276,000 in energy costs each year. The Tower was designed by NBBJ Architects and built by SKANSKA USA. I extend my thanks to these outstanding companies for their superb work. Many other individuals and groups also had major roles in making Montlake Tower a reality. Johnese Spisso, chief health system officer for UW Medicine and vice president for medical affairs, University of Washington has been a tireless, dedicated leader, from start to finish. Stephen Zieniewicz, executive director of UW Medical Center, has also been a strongly committed project leader. Helen Shawcroft, senior associate administrator at UW Medical Center, provided outstanding leadership that contributed to the on-time, on-budget construction. Kathleen Schaefers, design and construction manager, also did a superb job. Others with key roles include the Patient Advisory Council and our corporate partners. In U.S. News & World Report’s 2012 edition of America’s Best Hospitals, UW Medical Center is ranked No. 1 in both the region and state, with Harborview Medical Center ranked No. 2 out of 35 hospitals in the Seattle metropolitan area and more than 100 hospitals in the state. Valley Medical Center is ranked No. 4 in the metropolitan region and No. 7 in the state. The new expansion of UW Medical Center will further increase the ability of all of our hospitals, clinics and healthcare professionals to offer the best care for our patients. This expansion adds immeasurably to our ability to improve the health of our community members. Thank you to everyone who was involved in the planning and execution of this superb addition to UW Medicine. Paul G. Ramsey, M.D.\n\nCEO, UW Medicine\n\nExecutive Vice President for Medical Affairs and\n\nDean of the School of Medicine,\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\n\n\n   A new regulator for heart formation has been discovered by studying how embryonic stem cells adjust the packaging of their DNA. This approach to finding genetic regulators may have the power to provide insight into the development of any tissue in the body, including liver, brain, blood and others. A stem cell has the potential to become any type of cell. A UW-led research team was particularly interested in how stem cells turn into heart muscle cells. This knowledge may further research on repairing damaged hearts through tissue regeneration. The leaders of the project were Charles Murry, professor of pathology, bioengineering and medicine, and cardiac pathologist and stem cell biologist (photo, right); Randall Moon, professor of pharmacology, who studies the control of embryonic development; and John Stamatoyannopoulos, associate professor of genome sciences, who explores the operating systems of the human genome. The paper’s lead author is Sharon Paige, a UW M.D./Ph.D. student who completed her doctoral degree in Murry’s lab. The results are published in the Sept. 28 edition of Cell. Paige, an aspiring pediatric cardiologist, said, “By identifying regulators of cardiac development, this work has the potential to lead to a better understanding of the causes of congenital heart disease, thereby paving the way for therapeutic advances.” Previously, UW researchers had examined the signals that lead cells to grow into various kinds of heart tissue. In this case, the researchers entered a relatively unexplored area. They decided to look at the genetic controls behind the transformation of stem cells into heart tissue. Because stem cells keep their DNA code unrevealed until needed, the scientists examined how this packaging is altered over time to permit reading of portions of the code and thereby produce changes in the cell. The researchers pointed out that it was already known that the patterns that stem cells follow to modify their DNA packaging distinguished them from progenitor cells—cells prepared to begin a lineage of a particular type of cell—and also from cells that already had a working identity, such as blood or muscle cells. However, the dynamics of the DNA packaging modifications—how the packaging is programmed to change over time—and how these dynamics influence which genes are “exposed” and activated to create, for example, heart muscle cells, were poorly understood. The UW-led research team learned that, as human embryonic stem cells become heart cells, this differentiation is accompanied by distinctive dynamic alterations in DNA packaging. This tell-tale pattern enabled the scientists to distinguish the key regulators of heart development from other genes. Duplex-sequencing method could lead to better cancer detection and treatment The 'simple' idea of two young UW researchers may lead to reduced error rate in DNA sequencing and eventually better treatment and diagnosis of cancer. In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Michael Schmitt, postdoctoral fellow, and Jesse Salk, M.D./Ph.D. candidate, proposed that by reducing the error rate in DNA sequencing, researchers could better pinpoint which cells are mutating. This improvement could lead to early diagnosis of cancer and a better treatment plan once researchers knew which cells were resistant to chemotherapy.  Two University of Washington researchers, Michael Schmitt and Jesse Salk, talked about a simple but powerful idea to get better results when looking at cancer cells. If they could reduce the error rate in DNA sequencing, then researchers could better pinpoint which cells are mutating. This improvement could lead to early diagnosis of cancer and a better treatment plan once researchers knew which cells were resistant to chemotherapy. The idea was to sequence both strands of DNA. If researchers saw a mutation in one strand but not the other, they would recognize it as error from sequencing and not a true mutation. Their results, published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in August, are getting wide accolades. “If its power is confirmed, duplex sequencing will likely improve our understanding of the clonal substructure of human cancers, modify the catalog of rare mutations, help to pinpoint mechanisms of mutation generation, and potentially identify mutator phenotypes,” wrote Christopher Klein, with the Experimental Medicine and Therapy Research group at the University of Regensburg, in an accompanying editorial. “Eventually, it may open doors to clinical applications in which diagnostic accuracy is the sine qua non for ethical treatment decisions. Working in Lawrence Loeb’s cancer research laboratory at the UW, the scientists demonstrated an error rate of less than one mistake per half a million nucleotides sequenced and a theoretical limit of less than one error per billion nucleotides. In contrast, the standard method yielded one error for every 200 nucleotides. “Based on our estimates, we appear to have improved the accuracy of sequencing by 10 million-fold or more,” said Schmitt, the lead author of the paper, “Detection of ultra-rare mutations by next-generation sequencing.” Schmitt, a postdoctoral fellow in the Loeb lab, added, “This theoretically makes it possible to sequence the entire genome of a cell without a single error.” UW launches Palliative Care Center of Excellence Oct. 8\n\n\n\n With its official launch Oct. 8, the UW Palliative Care Center of Excellence will be poised to become an international leader in advancing the science and the delivery of palliative and end-of-life care for patients with chronic and life-limiting illnesses. The UW Palliative Care Center of Excellence will bring together individual leaders who are recognized for palliative care research, education and clinical care across the health sciences disciplines. “We are fortunate that the UW has pockets of excellence in palliative care across the health sciences schools and UW Medicine clinical sites,” said J. Randall Curtis, UW professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine and director of the new UW Palliative Care Center of Excellence. “However, there has not been a systematic coordination and integration of all these activities. The Center will be one of few academic palliative care institutions in the nation to comprehensively advance the science of palliative and end-of-life care by increasing interdisciplinary and interprofessional collaborations in research, education and clinical care. Of course, the ultimate goal is to improve quality of care for patients and their families.” Curtis, an international authority on critical, palliative and end-of-life care, was recently named the first holder of the A. Bruce Montgomery-American Lung Association Endowed Chair in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine. Curtis will co-direct the UW Palliative Care Center of Excellence with Anthony Back, professor of medicine in the Division of Oncology. Other UW faculty assuming leadership roles in the new center are Stuart Farber, professor of family medicine; Darrell Owens, clinical assistant professor of medicine and director of outpatient palliative medicine servicesat Harborview Medical Center; Wayne McCormick, professor in geriatrics and gerontology and director of the palliative medicine fellowship; Elizabeth Loggers, assistant professor in medical oncology and director of palliative care at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance; Ruth Engelberg, research associate professor in pulmonary and critical care medicine and associate director of end of life care program at Harborview Medical Center; and Helene Starks, associate professor of bioethics and humanities. The new UW Palliative Care Center of Excellence will be officially launched with the center's inaugural visiting lecture by Susan Block, professor of psychiatry and medicine at Harvard Medical School and co-director of the Harvard Medical School Center for Palliative Care (photo, left). Block is chair of the Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Block will give the lecture, Moving Conversations about the End of Life Upstream: The Serious Illness Communication Checklist, at 4 p.m., Monday, Oct. 8, in Room T-625, Health Sciences Building. Block, an international leader in palliative care, has directed national and international faculty development programs for palliative care clinicians. She studies interventions to improve communication in the setting of serious illness, psychological issues in palliative care and medical education. Curtis will be recognized for holding the first endowed chair in pulmonary and critical care medicine at a reception following Block’s lecture.

UW Medicine medical centers achieve high marks on UHC Quality and Accountability Performance Scorecard\n\n\n\nUW Medicine’s Harborview Medical Center and UW Medical Center continue to rise on the UHC Quality and Accountability Study. In the 2012 UHC rankings, Harborview was ranked No. 23 and UW Medical Center was ranked No. 31 overall in the nation out of 101 academic healthcare facilities. Additional highlights included Harborview and UW Medical Center both being ranked #1 for equity; Harborview being ranked in the top three for effectiveness; UW Medical Center being ranked in the top 25 for mortality and both hospitals being ranked in the top 20 for safety. The UHC Scorecard is an important benchmark that allows participating hospitals to compare their performance to more than 100 peer university hospitals based on the Institute of Medicine’s domains of care. The Quality and Accountability Study was designed to help academic medical centers identify structures and practices that are associated with high performance in quality and safety. UHC, an alliance of the nation’s leading nonprofit academic medical centers, measures performance on mortality, effectiveness, safety, equity, patient-centeredness and efficiency. At UW Medicine, high performance in these areas is a top priority. As a result of UW Medicine’s Patients Are First initiative, tremendous progress has been made since the first scorecard in 2005. The next goal is to win the UHC Quality Leadership Award by being one of the top 10 institutions in the country. The No. 1 ranking for equity reflects UW Medicine’s mission of providing quality and safe care for patients from all walks of life. Success in this area reflects the provision of excellent care for some of the sickest patients within the UHC membership. \n\n Effectiveness scores are based on core measures for quality care related to heart attacks, heart failure, pneumonia, selected surgical procedures and readmissions. In July, UW Medicine’s excellent performance resulted in achieving a first-ever 100-percent score by providing the correct care for every patient included in these sets of core measures. \n\n Safety scores are based on hospital-acquired events such as infections, pressure ulcers and events related to operative procedures. UW Medicine’s keys to success in this area include timely review of all events, continual attention to hand washing, careful cleaning of patient rooms, use of bundle practices and a daily commitment to provide safe, evidenced-based care. \n\n Efficiency rankings are based on comparing “observed” or actual cost and length of stay to “expected” cost and length of stay. UW Medicine’s progress in this area reflects the work of many teams and medical services in implementing process improvements and standardization methods. \n\n Documentation is a key component in mortality rankings, which compares the “observed” or actual number of deaths to the number of deaths “expected” based on the acuity of illness or injury. UW Medicine continued to provide 100 percent mortality review, with a focus on improved accuracy in documentation and coding of patient care. \n\n Patient-centeredness measures the 10 HCAHPS patient survey questions. Because UHC uses data that is well over a year old for this score, it is expected that next year’s study will begin to reflect the improvements in patient satisfaction achieved through the implementation of Patients are First across the organization. The 2012 UHC results are a credit to the continued efforts of UW Medicine faculty and staff and the focus on patient safety, quality and service at each site.  MEDEX Northwest, the UW School of Medicine’s physician assistant training program, has received $887,301 in federal funding to expand its training program to the University of Washington Tacoma campus. The funding is part of a national initiative to increase educational and employment opportunities for returning military veterans and to boost the healthcare workforce in primary care in rural and underserved areas. Last year, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) gave funding priority to universities and colleges with physician assistant programs that actively recruit, retain and mentor military veterans. They were also seeking model programs that could be replicated across the country to increase the healthcare labor workforce. Physician assistants (PAs) are healthcare professionals licensed to practice medicine with physician supervision. PAs conduct physical exams, diagnose and treat illnesses, order and interpret tests, counsel on preventive health care, assist in surgery, and in virtually all states can write prescriptions. Within the physician-PA relationship, physician assistants exercise autonomy in medical decision making and provide a broad range of diagnostic and therapeutic services. A PA's practice may also include education, research, and administrative services. All PA education programs must be accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). “Of all the PA programs in the country, we are seen as the number one champion for physician assistant training among experienced healthcare workers and the military,” said Ruth Ballweg, MEDEX director. “A big part of our history is training military personnel. Of our nearly 1,900 graduates, about 620 are military people. This funding allows us to add 24 training slots to the UW Tacoma campus, which is actively engaged in outreach with the returning military community and has a good working relationship and partnership with Joint Base Lewis-McChord.” The new Tacoma training site will join existing MEDEX sites located in Seattle, Yakima, Spokane, Wash., and Anchorage, Alaska. Bachelor’s degree programs will be offered at the Anchorage, Yakima and Tacoma sites, while master’s degree programs will be offered at the Seattle and Spokane sites. The Tacoma program will begin officially in spring 2013 with an online lead-in to later classroom instruction. The site director is Henry Stoll. Ballweg said the goal of the MEDEX program is to increase educational access for qualified applicants but also to provide affordable primary care in rural and underserved communities throughout the Pacific Northwest. Ballweg noted that, ironically, veterans with medical backgrounds have the highest unemployment among all veterans because members of the civilian community have a hard time translating the medical experience of military medics and corpsmen into actual jobs in healthcare. “Their training and experience on the battlefield is not understood. They’re not civilian nurses; they’re not paramedics. So, the community asks, ‘What are they?’ The MEDEX program values the experiences and qualities that military folks bring to the table,” Ballweg said. “Since we’ve been training physician assistants since 1969, we know that military personnel are highly likely to go into primary care and have the experience of, and often the preference for, working in rural and remote communities. They are used to having a lot of responsibility and taking charge.” New appointments in UW Medicine Alumni Relations\n\n\n\nAnnie Pontrelli, formerly director of UW Medicine Alumni Relations, has been named director of Medical Alumni Affairs, overseeing regional alumni programs. In this position, Pontrelli will build upon the many relationships she has made while connecting alumni with a vital part of the School of Medicine’s mission—educating students from the WWAMI region for the WWAMI region. “I can’t believe I’ve been working with UW Medicine alumni for almost 12 years,” says Pontrelli. “Everyone has been so supportive, and I have had the opportunity to work with wonderful alumni. I’m looking forward to meeting many more of you in the months ahead!” Sarah Brown Rothschild, who joined UW Medicine Advancement in September, succeeds Pontrelli as director of Alumni Relations. Rothschild has a decade of experience in alumni and media relations, with positions at the University of Arkansas Alumni Association, the University of Virginia and the Atlantic Coast Conference in Greensboro, N.C. Rothschild, who holds a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the University of Virginia, is excited to be at UW Medicine. “I am thrilled to join the UW Medicine family, and I look forward to meeting and working with alumni to continue building a vibrant and relevant alumni association for you,” Rothschild says. Pontrelli can be reached at pontrell@uw.edu and Rothchild at rothsb@uw.edu. Y. Ki Shin has been named the new western Washington assistant clinical dean. Shin, a general internist in Montesano, Wash., will develop clinical sites and workforce training across western Washington (excluding Seattle). Shin, who started in his new position July 1, is a 1993 WWAMI graduate and internal medicine Boise Primary Care Track residency graduate. He has been a preceptor in the Rural/Underserved Opportunities Program (R/UOP) since 1998 and teaches third-year students on their outpatient internal medicine rotation. Since July, Shin has assisted clerkship directors with the development of new clerkships in internal medicine and neurology in Olympia, obstetrics and gynecology in Bellingham, and neurology in Tacoma. He is also working to develop more R/UOP locations and other rural rotations around western Washington. He is also working closely with the MEDEX program to establish rural rotations for physician assistant students. \"Aas a graduate of UW who benefited from multiple WWAMI programs, I am very excited to further expand WWAMI exposure to western Washington, and to improve the work force development to needed communities in our region,” Shin said. There are five TRUST (Targeted Rural and Underserved Track) sites in western Washington and three of them will have WRITE (WWAMI Rural Integrated Training Experience) students in 2013. WRITE students will participate in a longitudinal integrated clerkship program in the communities of Ferndale, Port Townsend and Shelton. Students will complete a community service project and participate in community activities as part of their experience. Future plans in western Washington include the development of one to two more TRUST sites and expansion of WRITE to as many as thirty weeks to include emergency medicine and rural surgery. Discussion is also underway with several western Washington communities to develop opportunities in rural training for residents. The following events may be of interest to the UW Medicine community:     UW School of Medicine students host a week of exploration of primary care medicine. Through lectures, discussion and film, students will learn about various aspects of primary care medicine. Topics include community specialization and provider diversity in primary care, local to global approach to primary care, appropriate and accessible care for the LGBTQ community, fellowship opportunities in primary care, and  the National Health Service Corps.

a flight to an ice climbing expedition during an ice climbing trip to the canadian rockies last christmas two young researchers from the university of washington drs michael schmitt and jesse salk talked about a simple but powerful idea to get better results when looking at cancer cells if they could reduce the error rate in dna sequencing then researchers could better pinpoint which cells are mutating this improvement could lead to early diagnosis of cancer and a better treatment plan once researchers knew which cells were resistant to chemotherapy the idea was to sequence both strands of dna if they saw a mutation in one strand but not the other they would recognize it as error from sequencing and not a true mutation their results published online in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences in august are getting wide accolades if its power is confirmed duplex sequencing will likely improve our understanding of the clonal substructure of human cancers modify the catalog of rare mutations help to pinpoint mechanisms of mutation generation and potentially identify mutator phenotypes wrote christopher klein with the experimental medicine and therapy research group at the university of regensburg in an accompanying editorial eventually it may open doors to clinical applications in which diagnostic accuracy is the sine qua non for ethical treatment decisions mary levin some of the members of the loeb lab who worked on the duplex sequencing dr lawrence loeb scott kennedy dr michael schmitt and dr jesse salk working in dr lawrence loebs cancer research laboratory at the uw the scientists demonstrated an error rate of less than one mistake per half a million nucleotides sequenced and a theoretical limit of less than one error per billion nucleotides in contrast the standard method yielded one error for every 200 nucleotides based on our estimates we appear to have improved the accuracy of sequencing by 10 millionfold or more said schmitt the lead author of the paper detection of ultrarare mutations by nextgeneration sequencing schmitt a postdoctoral fellow in the loeb lab added this theoretically makes it possible to sequence the entire genome of a cell without a single error the genome of a cell is 6 billion nucleotides the uw researchers are eager to use this approach to test loebs mutator phenotype hypothesis proposed in 1974 the idea considered radical at the time surmises that the mutation rate in the early stages of tumor development is greater than that of normal cells this could explain how some cancers spread and become resistant to chemotherapies so quickly if researchers could see which cells are mutating faster then they could potentially detect cancer cells sooner at a more easily treatable stage loeb said this theory was accepted by just a minute percentage of the scientific community in 1974 and now probably about half pharmaceutical companies want to believe there is a magic bullet for treating cancer he said rather than expecting a magic bullet the realistic approach is to drastically slow down cancer progression to a point where a patient is more likely to die of something else loeb said he said a cancer drug will kill some of the cells but preexistent mutant cells will start to multiply and spread loeb said he will feel vindicated for his mutator phenotype hypothesis once a study looks at dna from human tumors and normal tissues from the same individual using this new technology if everything goes well this duplexsequencing technology could generate meaningful clinical information from patients in two to three years he said the first application could be looking at recurrent tumors how it evolved duplex sequencing evolved in 2005 with the advent of next generation sequencing which allowed researchers to sequence billions of nucleotides at a time the most direct means for finding preexisting cancer cells is to sequence cancer cells and identify cancerassociated mutations but with the substantial error rate in the original technology there were too many falsepositive findings scott kennedy a researcher in the loeb lab had been testing a method to refine next generation sequencing called safeseqs published by johns hopkins university researchers last year schmitt started working on safeseqs when he joined the lab as well but they couldnt get it to work we kept getting really screwy numbers and mutation types that didnt make any sense said kennedy we finally figured out it was due to damaged dna kennedy said he and schmitt spent a significant amount of time discussing how to get around the problem but didnt have a solution it was during a plane ride heading to an ice climbing trip last year that schmitt and salk came up with the duplexsequencing approach back in the lab schmitt and kennedy started running experiments sequencing m13 data – a virus that infects bacteria – because they had a good idea what the mutation rate should be the implementation of a relatively simple concept was quite complicated and involved writing a number of custom programs and analyzing extremely large data sets salk while vacationing in thailand and doing medical rotations in washington and idaho kept in contact with them through email and skype the results after only a matter of weeks the uw researchers had their results it worked m13 has an established base substitution frequency of 30 x 106 duplex sequencing measured a nearlyidentical rate of 25 x 106 the researchers reported its pretty remarkable just how quickly it all came together said salk in science very few ideas work as planned one thing that i think surprised us was that no one had developed this before the basic premise of the idea was so simple that we spent the better part of a day trying to come up with reasons why to wouldnt work thinking that we must have missed something obvious for this new generation of scientists all of whom are in their early 30s coming up with an idea took leaving the lab i think the best ideas come when you are doing things you enjoy said salk whose grandfather dr jonas salk a medical researcher and virologist discovered and developed the first polio vaccine in 1955 for me creativity does not happen in a cubicle their work is described in a report on genomeweb that refers to polymerase chain reaction a technology used for amplifying dna sequences the duplex sequencing method uses 24nucleotidelong tags split into two 12nucleotide additions to each end of the dna molecule which the researchers calls a duplex tag the tags are incorporated into standard illumina sequencing adapters after tagging strands the researchers pcr amplified them yielding families of molecules marked by a common tag by grouping molecules that share a tag the team could then compare sequences among them and eliminate any that didnt show at least three duplicates with at least 90 percent sharing the same sequence this step filtered out

            "text": "Working with lab cultures and mice, Johns Hopkins scientists have found that a strain of the common gut pathogen Bacteroides fragilis causes colon inflammation and increases activity of a gene called spermine oxidase (SMO) in the intestine.  The effect is to expose the gut to hydrogen peroxide – the caustic, germ-fighting substance found in many medicine cabinets -- and cause DNA damage, contributing to the formation of colon tumors, say the scientists.\n\n“Our data suggest that the SMO gene and its products may be one of the few good targets we have discovered for chemoprevention,” says Robert Casero, Ph.D., professor of oncology at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n\nIn a study, Casero and his colleagues introduced B. fragilis to two colon cell lines and measured SMO gene activity.  In both cell lines, SMO gene activity increased two to four times higher than cells not exposed to the bacteria.  The scientists also observed similar increases in enzymes produced by the SMO gene.  The scientists successfully prevented DNA damage in these cells by blocking SMO enzyme activity with a compound called MDL 72527.\n\nThe team also tested its observations in a mouse model, created by Johns Hopkins infectious disease specialist Cynthia Sears, M.D., to develop colon tumors.  Mice exposed to the bacteria had similar increases in SMO.  Mice treated with MDL 72527 had far fewer tumors and lower levels of colon inflammation than untreated mice.  Results of the experiments were published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in August.\n\nCasero says hydrogen peroxide can freely distribute through and into other cells.  “It roams around, and can damage the DNA in cells,” he says.\n\nRising levels of hydrogen peroxide and DNA damage in the colon are clear steps to tumor development, says Andrew Goodwin, Ph.D., who spearheaded the studies while performing graduate work in Johns Hopkins’ Cellular and Molecular Medicine Program and Casero’s laboratory.\n\nB. fragilis strains that secrete a toxin are widely known to cause diarrhea in children and adults, and previous studies, including those at Johns Hopkins, have linked the toxin-producing bacteria to inflammation and colon cancer.  Casero and collaborators previously linked the SMO gene to inflammation and cancer of the prostate and stomach.\n\nUsing MDL 72527 in humans is not advised, Casero says, because the compound blocks another enzyme in addition to SMO.  Investigators hope to develop a drug that targets only the SMO enzyme.  Candidates for such prevention strategies may include people with a history of colon polyps, which increases risk for colon cancer, and those with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nFunding for the research was provided by the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIn addition to Casero, Goodwin and Sears, other scientists who contributed to the research include Christina E. Destefano Shields, Shaoguang Wu, David L. Huso, XinQun Wu, Tracy R. Murray-Stewart, Amy Hacker Prietz, and Shervin Rabizadeh at Johns Hopkins; and Patrick M.

number of campers preregister this year and we couldnt be more thrilled about it said jeff howard parkland community development specialist in charge of the camp champs program childhood obesity is on the rise especially in medically underserved neighborhoods so were excited to teach kids how to develop healthier lifestyles while helping them to have fun at the same time with help from the childrens health fund camp champs was launched as a weeklong camp in 2010 this year there will be four camp sessions each lasting four days led by a team of parkland physicians nurses dietitians and health educators each day is dedicated to teaching a different element of a healthy lifestyle including mental health nutrition selfesteem and physical exercise campers will learn how to read food labels manage stress set goals and exercise for fitness and fun the program is offered in both english and spanish at no cost to participants parents are encouraged to attend with their children because research shows that with parental involvement the likelihood of children incorporating the changes into their lives increases tremendously in addition to learning healthy habits while having fun children are screened and evaluated by physicians and nurses during camp enabling them to identify any previously undetected health conditions any young patients from parklands schoolbased youth family health centers diagnosed with diabetes asthma or high body mass index bmi are referred to camp champs each year two of the main goals for camp champs are matching children without a medical home with a youth family health center and increasing parental involvement one of the longterm goals is to follow children through their school nurses with repeated measurements and to track this data to document how increased education makes a difference in the childrens habits the idea is to make an impact on these kids lives and to inspire them to start making changes now that will positively affect their health in the long run said howard this years camp dates and locations are listed below • june 1720 1 to 5 pm st john baptist church 1701 west jefferson st grand prairie 75051 • june 2427

independent school district disd methodist charlton helps severe asthma patients breathe easier with bronchial thermoplasty procedure thermoplasty system can make a big difference in the lives of those whose asthma is not wellcontrolled with standard asthma medications in addition to reducing asthma attacks the number of asthma medications emergency department visits hospitalization days off work and school and healthcare costs the procedure can greatly improve the patients quality of life methodist charlton is the only facility in the southern dallas county area offering the treatment and one of the few in the state of texas jim riley a masonry contractor in waxahachie suffered with asthma for years before learning about bronchial thermoplasty from his pulmonologist stephen mueller md an independently practicing physician on the medical staff at methodist charlton medical center he says the procedure was simple and quick and he returned to work the next day riley encourages others who are taking asthma medications but not receiving relief from their symptoms to consider bronchial thermoplasty i think its a good thing riley says bronchial thermoplasty is a minimallyinvasive procedure performed in three outpatient visits each treating a different area of the lungs and scheduled approximately three weeks apart the procedure is performed with a long

fireworks and sparklers produce a lot of heat said sue vanek rn burn program manager at parkland in fact the tip of a sparkler burns at 1200 degrees fahrenheit hot enough to produce thirddegree burns thats 300 degrees hotter than the temperature at which glass melts each july fourth across the nation thousands of people many of them children and teens are injured when handling fireworks according to the national fire protection agency nfpa us hospital emergency rooms treated an estimated 8600 people in 2010 for fireworksrelated injuries the risk of fireworks injury was highest for children ages 514 with more than twice the risk for the general population the nfpa also notes that far more us fires are reported on july 4 each year than on any other day and fireworks account for two out of five of those fires more than any other cause of fires fireworksrelated injuries frequently affect the hands face or even the back or groin area because of high temperatures burns caused by sparklers and fireworks are usually deep and require immediate medical attention preferably at a verified burn center burn centers provide the best treatment option when treating burn related injuries and provide the best chances for full return of function especially when the burns involve the hands or joints the best way to help someone injured by fireworks is to get them to a burn center as quickly as possible according to vanek if taken to another hospital facility the patient with a severe burn will need to be transferred to a burn center delaying treatment many people dont know we have a burn center here at parkland but our regional burn center serves a geographic area of more than 100000 square miles including north and east texas and southern oklahoma vanek stated parkland admits over 650 patients of all ages with serious burn injuries annually and treats more than 1200 outpatients if someone is injured by consumer fireworks or sparklers vanek advised that they extinguish any flames use cool water for areas that are smaller in size than the palm of their hand and seek medical treatment immediately dont put anything on this type of burn – no mayonnaise mustard egg whites or other home remedies because these can lead to infection she stated bring the patient to parkland as soon as possible avoiding fireworks injuries is the best plan for a funfilled fourth leave the fireworks show to the experts vanek concluded when it comes to fourth of july celebrations specialists at parkland memorial hospitals regional burn center would like people to enjoy parades potluck and apple pie but leave the fireworks to professionals although the number of patients seen at parkland each year with fireworksrelated injuries is not high burn injuries caused by fireworks are

bites not the great outdoors north texas poison center at parkland offers tips for a safer summer snakes are critical to the ecosystem and most are not aggressive animals said eileen lopez certified poison information specialist ntpc they are most likely to bite when they feel threatened startled or provoked so its important to take precautions to lower your risk of being bitten there are more than a hundred different types of species of snakes in texas but only about 15 percent are poisonous copperheads coral snakes cottonmouths also called water moccasins and rattlesnakes are the four species of venomous snakes found in the state avoiding a confrontation with a snake is the best way to avoid a bite experts say so its important to stay on hiking paths and wear thick boots and pants avoid walking in tall grass do not reach into logs rocky crevices or under rocks and use a walking stick to beat the ground to let snakes know you are coming if you are bitten stay calm remove any items of clothing that may constrict the area wash the bite with soap and water keep the bitten area lower than the heart and call the north texas poison center at 18002221222 as soon as possible lopez advised do not attempt to make an incision and suction the bite apply hot or cold packs constrict the area with a tourniquet and do not waste any time trying to kill or capture the offending snake scorpions are another texas native that can inflict a sharp painful sting although none of texass 18 varieties of scorpions is considered deadly individual reactions to a sting may vary scorpion venom is a neurotoxin and anyone stung should be watched closely for adverse or allergic reactions be aware of spiders particularly the brown recluse and black widow which are the two species of spiders in the us that cause more severe symptoms than just skin irritation and pain both species like to hide in dark dry locations like wood piles storage sheds and dark corners of garages or attics to avoid bites wear long sleeves long pants proper footwear and wear gloves when reaching into areas that may harbor spiders black widow bites can lead to severe muscle spasms pain in the back abdomen and extremities sweating fast heart rate and high blood pressure the bite of a brown recluse can cause skin inflammation around the bite and in rare cases can lead to tissue damage keep the north

and around their home ut southwestern researchers identify new source of powerful immunity protein the protein interferongamma ifnγ keeps viruses from replicating and stimulates the immune system to produce other diseasefighting agents neutrophils the newly identified cellular source of the protein are the major component of the pus that forms around injured tissue the researchers also report that the neutrophils appear to produce ifnγ through a new cellular pathway independent of tolllike receptors tlrs the bodys early warning system for invasion by pathogens this finding indicates that mammals might possess a second earlyalert system – the sort of builtin redundancy engineers would envy said dr felix yarovinsky assistant professor of immunology and senior author of the study published online in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences in june we believe our mouse study provides strong evidence that neutrophils white blood cells created in the bone marrow produce significant amounts of ifnγ in response to disease dr yarovinsky said the finding of a new and essential cellular source for ifnγ challenges a longheld belief in the field and is significant because neutrophils are the most common kind of white blood cell two pathogens were used in this study the parasite toxoplasma gondii – which can cause brain damage in humans and other mammals that have compromised immune systems – and a type of bacterium that causes gastroenteritis salmonella typhimurium innate immunity is the bodys first line of defense against pathogens including those that it has never before encountered adaptive immunity is the secondary system that battles pathogens to which the body has previously been exposed and to which it has developed antibodies textbooks list natural killer nk cells and t cells as the bodys significant sources of ifnγ although large numbers of neutrophils have long been observed to congregate at the site of a new infection they were commonly thought to be first responders or foot soldiers rather than generals in the battle against disease as this study indicates they are dr yarovinsky explained about 20 years ago there were clinical reports in humans and animals suggesting that neutrophils might produce ifnγ but the idea was largely ignored by the scientific community until the last decade he said since then studies at ut southwestern and elsewhere have found that mice lacking nk and t cells and therefore expected to be unable to produce ifnγ somehow continued to withstand infections better than mice genetically unable to make any ifnγ these observations suggested the possibility of an unknown source of the protein he explained in a series of experiments the ut southwestern researchers identified neutrophils as the major source of ifnγ in mice lacking nk and t cells based on what we know about neutrophils their large numbers and rapid deployment to the site of infection should provide an important means of very early robust and rapid elimination of diseasecausing agents the researchers wrote although neutrophilderived ifnγ alone is insufficient to achieve complete host protection the protein significantly extended the survival of mice in this study dr yarovinsky said in related news the burroughs wellcome fund in june announced that dr yarovinsky had been selected for its 2013 investigators in the pathogenesis of infectious disease award to further investigate mechanisms of host defense against various infectious diseases mediated by ifnγ produced by neutrophils the award will provide 500000 over five years to pursue this line of research others involved include first author carolyn sturge a graduate student of immunology former research assistant alicia benson

prevention center staff warns of water hazards drowning is leading cause of injury death to children 1 to 9 years home swimming pools pose the greatest risk for children being the site of 60 to 90 percent of drownings in the 0 to 4year old age range the key to preventing drowning deaths is having multiple layers of protection surrounding a pool on all four sides with a sturdy 4foot fence with gates that selfclose and selflatch at a height children can not reach is proven to reduce drownings said carrie nie associate director of the injury prevention center of greater dallas located at parkland which also facilitates the child death review team never leave a child alone in or near a pool whenever infants or toddlers are in or around water an adult should be within an arms length its also important to avoid inflatable swimming aids such as floaties they are not a substitute for approved life vests and can give parents and children a false sense of security nie said on a statewide level texas has one of the highest numbers of drownings according to the consumer product safety commission kids are particularly at risk as the highest percentage of 911 calls nationwide for neardrowning incidents are for children under age of 5 neardrowning is the term for survival after suffocation caused by submersion in water or another fluid an estimated 15000 to 17000 neardrownings occur in the us each year recently texas 83rd legislature designated april as water safety month to better coordinate a statewide response to drowning prevention nationally data indicate that twothirds of child drownings occurred in mayaugust this resolution brings awareness to drowning and water safety before the peak season of waterrelated activities like in motor vehicle crashes combining boating and alcohol consumption is a recipe for trouble just as drinking and driving a car is illegal boating while intoxicated is also against the law nie said its essential that we create a safe water environment for children and people of all ages drowning and neardrowning incidents are common each summer as people spend time in pools and spas on lakes and rivers and at the ocean according to statistics from the dallas county child death review team from 20072011 drowning was the leading cause of injury death in children 1 to 9 years of age in dallas county twothirds of all child drowning deaths occurred in a pool world hepatitis day focuses attention on serious health risks parkland provides education screening tests and treatment in dallas county the number of reported cases of hepatitis c nearly tripled from 2003 to 2010 and cases of chronic hepatitis b grew nearly fivefold in that period according to pranavi sreeramoju md infectious disease chief at parkland health hospital system people need to be educated about the serious health consequences of hepatitis b and c infection assess whether they may be at risk and if so get tested about 1800 people die every year in the us from hepatitis b and 16000 people die from hepatitis c these infections are as devastating as hivaids tuberculosis or malaria even though they generally do not receive as much media or political attention the incidence of viral hepatitis infection is higher among those with a low socioeconomic status compared to the general population dr sreeramoju added at parkland our goal is to prevent new infections and to provide the latest evidencebased treatment to people living with the disease those most at risk of infection are individuals with multiple sexual partners injection drug users men who have sex with men and commercial sex workers the risk of acquiring these infections via blood transfusions and organ transplantation is very low currently because of tremendous improvements in safety related to these procedures dr sreeramoju stated viral hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver with the most common types being hepatitis a b and c chronic viral hepatitis caused by the b or c virus is the leading cause of liver cancer and the most common cause for liver transplantation in contrast hepatitis a is generally transmitted through water and food contamination it is a selflimited disease that does not lead to chronic infection or chronic liver disease hepatitis a is preventable with food and water safety precautions and hepatitis a vaccine chronic hepatitis b which has been termed a silent epidemic is a serious disease that can result in longterm health problems and even death an estimated 600000 people die from the disease worldwide each year hepatitis b vaccine is included in the childhood immunization schedule adults who must be vaccinated against hepatitis b include healthcare and public safety workers adults engaged in high risk sexual behaviors or injection drug use persons on dialysis and international travelers hepatitis c infection is the most common chronic blood borne infection in the united states approximately 32 million persons are chronically infected although hepatitis c virus is not efficiently transmitted sexually persons at risk for infection through injection drug use are urged to seek care in public health settings where std and hiv prevention and control services are available there is no vaccine for hepatitis c and avoiding behaviors that spread the disease especially injection drug use is the most effective prevention hepatitis d and e are both serious liver diseases but are rare in the united states there is currently no vaccine for either hepatitis d is spread through blood contamination while hepatitis e is usually associated with water supplies contaminated with fecal matter in texas there is a great need for prevention early diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis b and c dr sreeramoju said hepatitis can be prevented parkland offers vaccination and testing for those at high risk and offers treatment for patients with hepatitis we want people to get educated about hepatitis and seek appropriate preventive or medical care as needed to find locations of parkland outpatient clinics providing testing and vaccination for hepatitis please visit our website at wwwparklandhospitalcom viral hepatitis does not discriminate patients may be young old male female rich poor and of any ethnicity according to the centers for disease control and prevention an estimated 44 million americans are living with chronic hepatitis and most are not aware that they are infected world hepatitis day launched in 2008 by the world hepatitis alliance and observed annually on july 28 aims to raise awareness and influence improvement in disease prevention and access to testing and treatment oxygen—key to most life—decelerates many cancer tumors when combined with radiation therapy in research examining tissue oxygenation levels and predicting radiation response ut southwestern scientists led by dr ralph mason reported in the june 27 online issue of magnetic resonance in medicine that countering hypoxic and aggressive tumors with an oxygen challenge – inhaling oxygen while monitoring tumor response – coincides with a greater delay in tumor growth in an irradiated animal model over the past several years the research of dr mason professor of radiology and the papers senior author and his colleagues has been building on findings that show lack of oxygen actually stimulates the growth of new blood vessels in tumors and leads to metastasis and genetic instability in cancer the theory follows that breathing oxygen or enriching the oxygen content of hypoxic low in oxygen cancer tissues improves therapy in the current study supported by the national cancer institute smaller tumors based on magnetic resonance imaging were found to be significantly better oxygenated than larger ones this confirmed previous investigations that show a range of hypoxic environments depending on the size of the tumor the next step is clinical trials to assess tumor response to radiation therapy said dr mason director of the cancer imaging program at the medical center tumors determined to be hypoxic can be evaluated and made responsive through mild and easytoadminister interventions such as breathing more oxygen or taking a vasoactive drug monitoring the response to oxygen breathing tells us which tumors will benefit if the results are confirmed in humans the implications for personalized therapies for other cancers could mean fewer radiation treatments or perhaps ideally one single highdose treatment lung cancer for instance is a form of the disease whose tumors are poorly oxygenated despite being located in the principle organ charged with oxygenating the blood the ability to stratify tumors based on hypoxia offers new opportunities to tailor therapy to tumor characteristics potentially enhancing success through personalized medicine dr mason said together with dr robert timmerman professor of radiation oncology at the harold c simmons cancer center and dr ivan pedrosa professor of radiology and the advanced imaging research center dr mason is starting clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of oxygenation during treatment with stereotactic body radiation in humans – work that is supported by the cancer prevention and research institute of texas cprit through one of its multiinvestigator research awards with cprit support dr masons team has worked to understand how low oxygen concentration can cause radiation resistance in tumors in some cases the simple addition of oxygen to stereotactic body radiation greatly improves response the key is to identify those patients who will benefit dr rami hallac an imaging scientist at the analytical imaging and modeling center at childrens medical center dallas

thus has an extremely low number of practicing family physicians says dr shima who was accompanied by three other family medicine physicians the purpose of this project is to train more family physicians as well as create a formal curriculum for residency training in family medicine the trip was the result of an ongoing collaboration between the chinese government and the american college of osteopathic family physicians each month for the first year a group of three family physicians go to china for approximately 10 days to teach and lecture the second year the group travels to china every other month and the third year they travel to china quarterly the goal is after this three year training the participating physicians from china will become the faculty for future residency programs to properly train family medicine residents i am grateful that i was given this opportunity and hope to continue my participation next year as part of the delegation dr shima says about

to local physicians ut southwestern researchers identify novel mechanism that helps stomach bug cause illness recycle nutrients in cells as well as to fight off pathogens the term autophagy comes from the greek words for self and eating during the process nutrients are recycled by the lysosome an internal organelle to produce metabolites that can be used by the cell our study identifies a bacterial effector that creates gated ion channels and reveals a novel mechanism that may regulate autophagy said dr kim orth professor of molecular biology and biochemistry she is a corresponding author on the published study the first author is anju sreelatha a graduate student in dr orths laboratory disruptions of autophagic pathways are implicated in many human diseases including neurodegenerative disease liver disease some cancers and cardiomyopathy heart muscle disease ms sreelatha said she explained that ion channels are pores in the membranes of cells or of organelles within cells that allow regulated passage of small molecules or ions across membranes gated channels have a mechanism that opens and closes them making these proteins potential targets for drug development the identification of a channel that opens and closes and thereby affects autophagy may give us a handle by which to modulate this important process she said adding that the researchers found that vopqs channel activity turned off autophagy during infection vopq is injected into the host cell where the protein binds to a lysosomal membrane protein and forms small pores all within minutes of infection the resulting complex of proteins causes ions to leak and the lysosomes to deacidify lacking acidification lysosomes can not degrade the unneeded cellular components and autophagy is disrupted ms sreelatha said dr orth said bacterial pathogens have evolved a number of ways to target and manipulate host cell signaling the ability of vopq to form a gated ion channel and to inhibit autophagy represents a novel mechanism further characterization of the mechanism by which vopq sabotages cells to disrupt autophagy may lead to a better understanding of hostpathogen interactions as well as advance our understanding of the pathway eventually leading to new treatments for diseases in which autophagy has gone awry they noted other ut southwestern scientists involved were dr hui zheng a

tips to avoid heat exhaustion heat stroke putting the community at risk parklands staff encourages people of all ages to be cautious while participating in outdoor activities to avoid developing heat exhaustion or heat stroke heat exhaustion occurs when people are exposed to high temperatures especially when combined with strenuous physical activity and humidity and when the body loses fluids and becomes dehydrated when heat exhaustion elevates it may result in heat stroke a lifethreatening medical condition occurring when the bodys cooling system which is controlled by the brain stops working the resulting high body temperature causes damage to internal organs including the brain and could result in death its especially important to pay attention to those at high risk for developing heat stroke such as children the elderly and patients with chronic medical problems said noel o santini md medical director parkland community oriented primary care symptoms of heat stroke include thirst red warm and dry skin body temperature over 104 degrees fahrenheit fast breathing and heart rate vomiting muscle cramps confusion or disorientation and coma dr santini provides the following tips to prevent heat stroke • avoid exposure to extreme temperatures • rest while participating in physical activity • drink plenty of fluids especially water and minimize alcoholic consumption • if you exercise outdoors do so early in the morning • wear loose and lightweight clothing • avoid strenuous physical activities in high temperatures the heat here in texas can be a serious threat and its something that shouldnt be taken lightly said dr santini go immediately to an emergency room or call 911 if you or someone else is disoriented vomiting can not drink fluids short of breath or

noninvasive test optimizes colon cancer screening rates utsw study finds researchers at ut southwestern and the university of california san diego have found that organized mailing campaigns offering two colorectal cancer tests increased screening rates as much as threefold among uninsured patients the study is available online in the aug 5 edition of jama internal medicine fit a quick and easy test that requires no special preparation detects small amounts of occult hidden blood in a patients stool sample completed tests are then mailed to a laboratory for analysis the findings presented in the published paper showed that with the help of a mail campaign fit participation tripled and colonoscopy participation doubled in the study sample in the investigation uninsured patients at john peter smith jps health network in fort worth ages 54 to 64 years and not up to date with their screenings were mailed invitations to use and return a nocost fit or to schedule a nocost colonoscopy both groups also received followup telephone calls to promote testing the study suggests that the best approach to offering and delivering screening to underserved populations may be through fit said senior author dr celette sugg skinner associate director of population science and cancer control for the harold c simmons cancer center questions for the future are whether superior participation can be maintained in the fit group because the test must be repeated every year and how adherence rates will impact overall screening effectiveness and cost study authors say the findings raise the possibility that costeffective largescale public health efforts to boost screening may be more successful if noninvasive tests such as fit are offered along with colonoscopy screenings the study was conducted by ut southwesterns division of digestive and liver diseases in conjunction with the simmons cancer center and the moncrief cancer institute in close collaboration with jps health network

disasters disasters – such as terrorism and airplane crashes – can add to that burden adverse mental health outcomes may not be as apparent as are physical injuries such as broken bones bleeding and other obvious trauma but our review clearly shows that mental injuries are prevalent and require a similar system for identifying triaging and treating these individuals just as you would those with physical injuries said dr carol north professor of psychiatry at ut southwestern and senior author of the study publishing in the journal of the american medical association the aug 7 issue focuses on violence and human rights for example she said it is important to distinguish between those who are experiencing distress – which nearly everyone does in a disaster – from psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd so that people can be treated appropriately ptsd is the most common disorder associated with most disasters with nearly 1 in every 3 people who are directly exposed to severe disasters showing signs of ptsd and nearly onefourth showing signs of major depressive disorder the review showed the review also found that people at greatest risk for mental health issues are women people with preexisting disorders those lacking adequate social services and those already stressed severity of exposure was an additional factor that mental health responders could use to help pinpoint who needs help researchers found that people with more intense reactions were more likely to accept mental health referrals than those with less intense reactions to a disaster other findings included · nine of 10 people are likely to experience trauma in their lifetimes · as many as 40 percent of distressed individuals had preexisting psychiatric disorders · between 11 percent and 38 percent of distressed individuals evaluated at shelters and familyassistance centers after disasters have stressrelated and adjustment disorders and · disorders included bereavement major depressive disorders and substance abuse disorders in addition to developing a consistent and integrated system for identifying triaging and treating people more evidencebased research is needed to determine which treatments are most effective said dr north who is a member of the emergency medicines section on homeland security at ut southwestern and director of the program in trauma and disaster at the va north texas health care system while there is evidence to support treatments for patients with active psychiatric disorders interventions such as psychological first aid psychological debriefing crisis counseling and psychoeducation for distressed individuals have not been adequately evaluated to determine whether they help or hurt in disaster settings dr betty

steps before i was in severe pain but in late march something unexpected happened patrices excruciating pain came to an end almost immediately its called an intramedullary nailing in this case augmented with an iliac crest bone graft dr borrelli said during the twohour procedure dr borrelli harvested a bone graft from her pelvis we use a mechanism that scrapes bone from the pelvis to

chemical reacts to uv light in study on tanning when you give somebody alcohol or cocaine – or anything rewarding – you see an increase in dopamine in the brain said dr bryon adinoff professor of psychiatry who leads the division on addictions this will be the first study to explore whether dopamine is released in response to uv light and the first to look at whether there are brain differences in people who compulsively tan compared to those who dont researchers are seeking about 20 local study participants between 18 and 45 years of age for details call 2146456901 or go to dopamine response to ultraviolet light in frequent and infrequent tanners dr adinoffs previous studies in compulsive tanners showed increased blood flow in areas of the brain related to reward during tanning and noted that compulsive tanning shares similarities to other addiction behaviors while a good first step dr adinoff said the golden study is needed to determine what uv light physically does to specific brain receptors and to make crucial comparisons between those who tan frequently and those who do not blood flow is a relatively nonspecific marker what rewards do more specifically is they increase dopamine he said we hypothesize that the increase in dopamine will be less in the frequent tanners compared to the infrequent tanners the golden investigation seeks to answer two questions 1 when uv light is administered does dopamine increase in the brain 2 is there a difference in dopamine receptors in people who compulsively tan compared to those who dont researchers will use a singlephoton emission computed tomography spect scan similar to a pet scan of the brain to track a compound that attaches to dopamine receptors the more receptors the more the compound attaches when dopamine is released it pushes the compound off the receptors comparing the compounds levels before and after exposure to uv light allows researchers to indirectly track how much dopamine is released eventually researchers hope to raise money to design and build a unique machine that would allow them to control the uv frequency during functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri scans that would show brain reactions in real time currently the metal of the tanning machines interferes with mri scans ut southwestern ut dallas and ut arlington are collaborating on such a potential design we would have to design a new type of tanning light by doing that we could then also change the frequency in real time dr adinoff said we could look at specific frequencies of uv light and see how they influence the brain the golden study is supported by the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases dr adinoffs ut southwestern colleagues in the trial include dr michael

director of conferences and events for vendome group publisher of healthcare design new parkland hospital is a perfect case study of the challenges in building the healthcare facility of the future and the collaboration and groundbreaking solutions required to keep a project ontrack and onbudget parkland offered a unique joint presentation at the event with all of our project consultants including clinical liaisons architects design engineers and director of organizational sustainability energy conservation said parklands walter jones senior vice president of facilities planning and development design professionals from all over the country gathered here to learn from our experience in designing a health care facility for the 21st century new parkland boasts innovative patientcentered healing concepts incorporating the latest research into the design jones explained for example all rooms in the facility are private and feature large windows with pleasing views of nature or the cityscape after researching global trends we found that encouraging a connection to the outside world created a healing environment jones said hospitals with better environments have improved patient recovery times in addition new parkland includes a beautifully landscaped oneacre park offering direct access to nature all rooms feature samehanded layout for flexibility and easy conversion to a variety of clinical services to meet demand decentralized nursing stations that facilitate a more direct approach to patient care and onstage offstage circulation patterns that segregate patients and visitors from staff and support services via separate corridors and elevators resulting in a quieter more therapeutic environment sustainability is another key design focus and parkland is targeting the leed® silver designation for good stewardship in use of environmental and conservation features according to jones the new parkland hospital is an expansive 25 million square feet comprised of 862 inpatient beds 108 emergency treatment rooms 24 operating rooms and 96 neonatal intensive care unit beds with more than 30000 people expected to pass through its doors each day

hosted the conference keeping athletes injury free by angel biasatti director of community and public relations methodist mansfield medical center alexander cho md independently practicing orthopedic and sports medicine physician on the medical staff at methodist mansfield medical center staying in good shape is important consistent exercise strength training and crosstraining can boost energy keep muscles in shape and help prevent injury before beginning any workout dr cho reminds athletes to warm up their muscles with stretching and light aerobic exercises afterward make sure to cool down with walking and more stretching exercise and resistance programs that are different from a students usual sport and normal routine are highly beneficial strengthening weak muscles is key to preventing most common injuries in sports like a swimmers shoulder tennis elbow runners knee achilles tendonitis or shin splints variability in training improves strength power and agility while decreasing the repetitive stress on one or two body parts that are constantly worked dr cho explains for instance a runner training for an upcoming meet could benefit from swimming once a week to decrease stress on the legs incorporating vigorous aerobic exercise improves the bodys ability to handle physical exertion in any sport dr cho recommends varying the intensity duration and frequency of aerobic exercise challenging on one day then lighter on another — especially on days of hard workouts in the primary sport every day increase the heart rate for at least 10 minutes at a time and perform jump routines and pivoting exercises dr cho recommends take it slowly at first then gradually increase the time and intensity and dont forget about your core where strength is critical in any sport to get the most of training nutrition and hydration are also vital consume a properly balanced meal of protein carbohydrates fruits and vegetables and dairy dr cho says carbohydrates should comprise about 33 percent of meals fruits and vegetables 33 percent dairy 15 percent protein 15 percent and fats and sugar no more than 4 percent drink plenty of water throughout the day every day hydration is not something that occurs the night before a big game dr cho says make a habit of drinking at least 16 ounces of water two hours prior to exercising and remember throughout practice — about every 15 to 20 minutes — to keep your body hydrated take steps today toward an injuryfree year by exercising regularly making conditioning a priority and making smart food choices as your child heads back to school and competes in school sports overuse and trauma injuries are common whether its lowback pain from playing football or an ankle injury sustained while playing volleyball athletes can reduce injuries by strengthening all of their muscles and adopting a daily training program designed to optimize performance and minimize the chance of injuries overuse injuries occur when

feels when humidity is combined with air temperature the combination of heat and humidity can be dangerous even practicing during the early morning or late evening can lead to severe heat stress said alexander eastman md interim trauma medical director at parkland and the lead medical officer for the dallas police department swat team even in finely tuned athletic swat officers heat injuries can occur without much warning its important that everything be taken into consideration before and especially during any type of practice regardless if there is physical contact or not in 2012 28 patients were treated at parkland for heatrelated illnesses including heat exhaustion and heat stroke of those 10 had to be hospitalized since january eight patients have been treated in parklands emergency department with a heatrelated diagnosis of those two required hospitalization the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc recommends that outdoor activities should be scheduled carefully even if outdoor activity is limited to morning and evening hours athletes are advised to try to rest often in shady areas so that the bodys thermostat will have a chance to recover in addition athletes should pace themselves if they are not accustomed to working or exercising in a hot environment start slowly and pick up the pace gradually if exertion in the heat makes an individuals heart pound and leaves them gasping for breath stop all activity get in a cool area or at least into the shade and rest especially if they are lightheaded confused weak or faint one of the most important things people can do is have a buddy system dr eastman said when practicing in the heat monitor your teammates and have someone do the same for you and above all practice common sense and know the warning signs dr eastman said watch for signs and symptoms like • feeling tired or weak • nausea and vomiting • headache or muscle cramps • dizziness or disorientation • sweatsoaked pale skin • loss of consciousness teams and schools should have a plan to help athletes slowly get used to practicing in hot weather kids are most at risk for heat illness during the first days of practice they should wear lightweight lightcolored clothing regularly drink plenty of water and never limit the amount kids may drink during games or practice and athletes never should practice or play if theyre sick especially with a fever vomiting or diarrhea dr eastman warned if an athlete has a medical condition like asthma or is taking medication tell the coach coaches should know each athletes physical condition because it can increase the risk for heat illness heat stroke is the top cause of preventable death in high school athletes according to the cdc if you think a young athlete has heat illness quickly get medical assistance or call 911 young athletes practicing in hot weather are at risk for heat illness and it can happen outside or inside a hot gym therefore physicians with parkland health hospital system warn athletes coaches and parents to know how hot is too hot knowing the temperature and humidity is important watch the heat index which",

When a child with CPT has a spontaneous fracture, usually happening before the age of two, the fracture fails to heal properly. This can lead to multiple surgeries, severe disability, deformity and possible amputation.\n\n Patrice fractured her tibia around the age of one and broke the same leg bone in the sixth grade. Her birth defect led to more than four surgeries in hopes of helping her right leg heal properly.\n\n “For people suffering from CPT, you’ll see what looks like a floppy leg bent inward,” said Dr. Joseph Borrelli, orthopedic department chair at Texas Health Arlington Memorial Hospital and orthopedic surgeon with Texas Health Physicians Group. “Some patients even have a bow-legged look about them.” \n\n “I had been walking around with a broken leg for years,” said Patrice. “I could only walk a few steps before I was in severe pain.”\n\n But in late March, something unexpected happened. Patrice’s excruciating pain came to an end, almost immediately.\n\n “It’s called an intramedullary nailing, in this case augmented with an iliac crest bone graft,” Dr. Borrelli said. During the two-hour procedure, Dr. Borrelli harvested a bone graft from her pelvis. “We use a mechanism that scrapes bone from the pelvis. To diminish the possibility of injury, we stop before reaching the inner table of the pelvis.” The bone shavings from Patrice’s pelvis were then mixed with bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). BMPs are considered implants, with the protein solution used to stimulate bone growth. Dr. Borrelli also inserted a rod into Patrice’s tibia, securing it with four screws. The BMP mixed with bone graft was placed at the previous nonunion site.\n\n “When I woke up after surgery, the pain was gone,” Patrice said. “I didn’t even take the pain medication they prescribed me.”\n\n Patrice says the surgery has boosted her self-confidence and body image. In the past, she didn’t like showing her legs. “I used to always wear pants, but now I plan to wear dresses and skirts whenever I can.”\n\n Patrice’s improved quality of life changed more than just her physical appearance. “People would always tell me that the surgeries were a big risk, and that scared me,” she said. “I’m no longer afraid, and now I tell people they should never be fearful of taking a chance. I could have still been walking around in pain, but I’m not.”\n\n With a new outlook on life, Patrice plans to achieve several goals in the near future. “I want to run and jog and be more active,” she said. “I can’t wait to join the gym and work out with my younger brother. I’m so much happier now.”\n\n To learn more about orthopedic services offered at Texas Health Arlington Memorial, visit www.texashealth.org/arlington-ortho.  \n\n Texas Health Arlington Memorial Hospital is a 369-bed acute-care, full-service medical center serving Arlington and the surrounding communities since 1958.

            "text": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Genetically modified corn seeds are no longer protecting Brazilian farmers from voracious tropical bugs, increasing costs as producers turn to pesticides, a farm group said on Monday.\n\nProducers want four major manufacturers of so-called BT corn seeds to reimburse them for the cost of spraying up to three coats of pesticides this year, said Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja farm lobby in Mato Grosso state.\n\n\"The caterpillars should die if they eat the corn, but since they didn't die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reais ($54) per hectare ... at a time that corn prices are terrible,\" he said.\n\nLarge-scale farming in the bug-ridden tropics has always been a challenge, and now Brazil's government is concerned that planting the same crops repeatedly with the same seed technologies has left the agricultural superpower vulnerable to pest outbreaks and dependent on toxic chemicals.\n\nExperts in the United States have also warned about corn production prospects because of a growing bug resistance to genetically modified corn. Researchers in Iowa found significant damage from rootworms in corn fields last year.\n\nIn Brazil, the main corn culprit is Spodoptera frugiperda, also known as the corn leafworm or southern grassworm.\n\nSeed companies say they warned Brazilian farmers to plant part of their corn fields with conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to GMO seeds.\n\nDow Agrosciences, a division of Dow Chemical Company, has programs in Brazil to help corn farmers develop \"an integrated pest management system that includes, among other things, the cultivation of refuge areas,\" it said in an email.\n\nAnother company, DuPont, said it had not received any formal notification from Aprosoja. The company's Pioneer brand has been working with producers to extend the durability of its seed technology and improve efficiency since Spodoptera worms were found to have developed resistance to the Cry1F protein, it said in a statement.\n\nThe other two companies, Monsanto Co and Syngenta AG did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nTomczyk, who also spoke for Brazilian farmers during a dispute over seed royalty payments to Monsanto that ended last year, said Aprosoja encouraged the planting of refuge areas. But he said the seed companies have not given clear instructions.\n\n\"There are barely any non-GMO seeds available ... it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers,\" he said. Aprosoja hopes to reach a negotiated agreement with the seed companies, but if all else fails farmers may sue to get reparations for pesticide costs, he added.\n\nBrazil is harvesting its second of two annual corn crops and expects to produce 78 million tonnes this crop year, slightly less than last season's record. Domestic prices recently hit their lowest in four years due to abundant supplies.\n\nThis article originally appeared at Reuters. Copyright 2014. Follow Reuters on Twitter.",

for the restrictions to be loosened even further so that objects 10 cm big can be captured 4 fracking drinking water drinking water sources are at greater risk from fracking than previously thought a new study from stanford university reveals that fracking is taking places much closer to the surface than generally believed and in some cases occurs within underground drinking water sources the fracking industry typically asserts that it does not frack underwater drinking water sources maintaining that it operates further underground fracking is exempt from the 2005 safe drinking water act in the us which means that fracking into drinking water sources is allowed the study does not identify contamination of water supplies but highlights the risk present due to fracking activity in and around water sources and the lack of knowledge of potential consequences due to lack of monitoring and assessment over the past 6 years the epa launched 3 investigations into potential contamination of drinking water by fracking and other similar practices initial findings identified contamination in all three cases but the epa quickly shelved the investigations 5 east coast fracking a nova scotia company atlantic industrial services is seeking to dump 30 million litres of frackwater into a new brunswick municipal sewer system frackwater is many times saltier than sea water and often contains a wide array of chemicals including those which are carcinogenic or radioactive the companys own assessment argues that if released to the environment would pose no human health risk or environmental risk but where atlantic industrial services wastewater has been rejected for concerns over sodium chloride and radioactive content they claimed to only have reduced the amounts of these substances still leaving some present the province of new brunswick has yet to decide on this proposal and further east newfoundland and labrador has approved an external review of fracking despite widespread concern fracking proposals for the region are continuing to grow including on the outskirts of gros morne national park there has been a moratorium on fracking in place since november when an internal review of the practice was announced while some particularly in opposition parties see the timing of this announcment as an election ploy whether or not it is it speaks to the considerable concern over and opposition towards fracking being made visible 6 more pests more pesticide with genetically modified crops some of the consequences of genetically modified crops are being experienced in brazil this growing season as pests are becoming resistant to pesticdes and farmers are spending more money to spray their crops with growing amounts of chemicals farmers are moving for four major manufacturers of genetically modified corn seeds to reimburse them for the cost of spraying up to three coats of pesticides this year the seeds are genetically modified to produce insecticide but caterpillars are now adapting to these seeds and thrive on the corn ricardo tomczyk president of aprosoja farm lobby in mato grosso state explains the caterpillars should die if they eat the corn but since they didnt die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reais 54 per hectare at a time that corn prices are terrible the companies making the seeds recognise the possibility of such problems and the inability of genetically modified seeds to provide an overall solution dow agrosciences a subsidiary of the dow chemical company advocates an integrated pest management system that includes among other things the cultivation of refuge areas while the farm lobby group supports the idea of refuge areas in itself suggesting the unsustainability of genetically modified crops it also notes the difficulty of this idea tomczyk the lobbys president states there are barely any nongmo seeds available it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers 7 mexico rules

In/Security Edition on 100.3fm, CKMS in Waterloo, Ontario, soundfm.ca on the web. Today is August 14, 2014.\n\nWe are broadcasting from the centre of the Haldimand Tract, the occupied Grand River Territory of the Six Nations (Haudenosaunee).\n\nThe Daily GRRR! is a project of the Grand River Media Collective; and is supported by the Community Radio Fund of Canada and CKMS.\n\nToday’s feature is an interview with independent Palestinian journalist Rami Almeghari, a regular contributor to the Electronic Intifada, speaking in detail about the recent Israeli attack on Gaza. This interview details the current struggles facing the people of Gaza as \"ceasefire\" talks continue in Cairo, focusing on the efforts to dig out from under the rubble and also specifically the struggles around shortages of water and electricity. This interview was conducted by Stefan Christoff for CKUT.\n\nWe will begin today with headlines:\n\n1. Mining Company Evicted\n\nIn Secwepemc territory, in so-called British Columbia, the Neskonlith Band has issued an eviction notice to Imperial Metals, the company that runs the Mount Polley Mine whose tailings pond breached more than a week ago. Their notice of eviction concerns the Ruddock Creek Mining Corporation which is planning to start a zinc-lead mine roughly 100 km northwest of Revelstoke.\n\n In the statement, Chief Judy Wilson says, “Imperial Metals failed to properly protect Secwepemc land and waters and our traditional and current uses in our territory”. The tailings pond breach devastated lakes and rivers in its wake. Reflecting on this disaster, Shuswap Environmental Action Society president Jim Cooperman stated, “We don’t trust this company now one iota with their ability to manage tailings ponds.”\n\n Chief Judy Wilson added in her statement, “Neskonlith, part of the Lake Secwepemc People, have an obligation to protect our land for our future generations. Neskonlith Indian Band cannot permit any mining development especially in these Sacred Headwaters that will contaminate the water or destroy our salmon habitat.”\n\n2. Indigenous Communities Surveilled\n\nWikiLeaks has released documents this month exposing corporate and government surveillance of Indigenous communities, and surveillance focused on movements that could block corporate plans for oil and gas. The documents released are from Stratfor, a corporate intelligence firm, as well as government departments. Stratfor analyst e-mails from 2008 note the linkage of environmental issues, oil & gas exploration, Indigenous rights, and anti-capitalism by settler and Indigenous groups in the lead-up to the 2010 olympics. A number of government cables from the 1970s have also been released, including from the US in 1977, detailing the CIA's concern about a Haudenosaunee delegation traveling to Europe to discuss issues of injustice and using their own passports as sovereign nations rather than being subsumed into the US.\n\n3. Google Can See You Up Close\n\nThe high-resolution satellite Worldview-3 launched yesterday. The ability to capture images at 25 cm resolution, twice as detailed as the previous limit of 50 cm, was approved two months ago following lobbying by satellite company DigitalGlobe, as reported on this show. In six months, the images it captures will be available for purchase by private corporations including Google, already a customer of the company. With this detailed imagery, google maps will be able to include 10-inch objects on maps, and for instance allows for the make of a car to be discerned. DigitalGlobe is now moving for the restrictions to be loosened even further, so that objects 10 cm big can be captured.\n\n4. Fracking Drinking Water\n\nDrinking water sources are at greater risk from fracking than previously thought. A new study from Stanford University reveals that fracking is taking places much closer to the surface than generally believed, and in some cases occurs within underground drinking water sources. The fracking industry typically asserts that it does not frack underwater drinking water sources, maintaining that it operates further underground. Fracking is exempt from the 2005 Safe Drinking Water Act in the US, which means that fracking into drinking water sources is allowed. The study does not identify contamination of water supplies, but highlights the risk present due to fracking activity in and around water sources, and the lack of knowledge of potential consequences due to lack of monitoring and assessment.\n\n Over the past 6 years, the EPA launched 3 investigations into potential contamination of drinking water by fracking and other similar practices. Initial findings identified contamination in all three cases, but the EPA quickly shelved the investigations.\n\n5. East Coast Fracking\n\nA Nova Scotia company, Atlantic Industrial Services, is seeking to dump 30 million litres of frackwater into a New Brunswick municipal sewer system. Frackwater is many times saltier than sea water, and often contains a wide array of chemicals including those which are carcinogenic or radioactive. The company's own assessment argues that “if released to the environment would pose no human health risk or environmental risk,” but where Atlantic Industrial Service's wastewater has been rejected for concerns over sodium chloride and radioactive content, they claimed to only have reduced the amounts of these substances, still leaving some present. The province of New Brunswick has yet to decide on this proposal.\n\nAnd further east, Newfoundland and Labrador has approved an external review of fracking. Despite widespread concern, fracking proposals for the region are continuing to grow, including on the outskirts of Gros Morne National Park. There has been a moratorium on fracking in place since November, when an internal review of the practice was announced. While some, particularly in opposition parties, see the timing of this announcment as an election ploy, whether or not it is, it speaks to the considerable concern over and opposition towards fracking being made visible.\n\n6. More Pests, More Pesticide with Genetically Modified Crops\n\nSome of the consequences of genetically modified crops are being experienced in Brazil this growing season, as pests are becoming resistant to pesticdes, and farmers are spending more money to spray their crops with growing amounts of chemicals. Farmers are moving for four major manufacturers of genetically modified corn seeds to reimburse them for the cost of spraying up to three coats of pesticides this year.\n\n The seeds are genetically modified to produce insecticide, but caterpillars are now adapting to these seeds and thrive on the corn. Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja farm lobby in Mato Grosso state, explains, “The caterpillars should die if they eat the corn, but since they didn't die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reais ($54) per hectare... at a time that corn prices are terrible.”\n\nThe companies making the seeds recognise the possibility of such problems and the inability of genetically modified seeds to provide an overall solution. Dow Agrosciences (a subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company) advocates “an integrated pest management system that includes, among other things, the cultivation of refuge areas.” While the farm lobby group supports the idea of refuge areas (in itself suggesting the unsustainability of genetically modified crops), it also notes the difficulty of this idea. Tomczyk, the lobby's president, states, “There are barely any non-GMO seeds available … it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers.”\n\n7. Mexico Rules Against Monsanto\n\nMonsanto's permit to plant roundup-ready soybeans in seven Mexican states has been overturned. The judge cited evidence about the threat to honey production in the Yucatán peninsula, and ruled that coexistence between honey production and genetically modified soybeans is not possible. Approximately 25,000 families in the Yucatán peninsula depend on honey production. The decision to overturn Monsanto's permit is being hailed as a victory for apiarists.\n\n8. Ferguson Cops Continue Assault\n\nAfter the police killing of unarmed black teen Michael Brown in Ferguson Missouri, riots and other demonstrations of outrage over this tragedy have been met with further instances of militarised, violent police. Airspace over the city was restricted by the FAA, which quickly changed its decision, again allowing planes to fly over the area. While the ban was in place, news helicopters could not fly over the city to document protest activity. Two journalists on the ground were also arrested without charge, though they were released soon after. Police have been firing tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds gathered in response to the killing, and shot another man with a live round early Wednesday. The officer who shot Michael Brown is currently on paid leave.\n\nFeature: An interview with independent Palestinian journalist Rami Almeghari, a regular contributor to the Electronic Intifada, speaking in detail about the recent Israeli attack on Gaza.

            "text": "Research conducted by a Harvard undergraduate has traced the rise of mercury pollution in endangered seabirds and highlighted the importance of museum collections as a time capsule concerning conditions on Earth over the past century.\n\nThe research, by Anh-Thu Elaine Vo ’08, now a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, details mercury levels in the feathers of endangered black-footed albatrosses from 1880 to 2002, showing increased levels after World War II and after 1990, when Asian industrialization is believed to have increased emissions. Similar studies have documented the rise of environmental mercury levels in other seas, including the Atlantic and the North Sea, but this is the first to do so for the Pacific.\n\nMercury is known as a highly toxic pollutant that can have detrimental effects on the environment. It can become particularly toxic for top predators in a food web, because the consumption of creatures with lower mercury levels concentrates it in their tissues. This environmental concentration has led to human consumption advisories for some marine predatory fish, such as tuna.\n\nBlack-footed albatrosses, with 7-foot wingspans, are among the oceans’ top predators, living on small fish, squid, and crustaceans. Though Vo’s work illustrated that mercury does concentrate in the birds’ tissues, it is not known at what level mercury becomes poisonous in the birds. The albatrosses are considered endangered by the IUCN Red List, but the main threat to them is believed to be longline fishing, which snares an estimated 3,000 birds a year.\n\n“We don’t know whether these concentrations are deleterious for this specific species although adverse effects are associated with the observed concentrations in other waterbirds,” said Vo.\n\nVo’s research was conducted under the guidance of Scott Edwards, an ornithologist and professor of organismic and evolutionary biology, and Michael Bank, a research associate in the Harvard School of Public Health’s Trace Metals Lab, where some of the mercury testing was done, and with the assistance of James Shine, a senior lecturer on aquatic chemistry. It was published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in April.\n\nVo examined mercury concentrations in feathers taken from two museum collections. One is Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), which had specimens collected from 1880 to 1949, and the second is at the University of Washington, which had more-recent specimens. Vo said the assistance of the Harvard Trace Metals Lab and Dartmouth College Trace Metals Analytical Laboratory were critical to the research because she couldn’t have done the mercury analysis without it.\n\n“We knew from the literature that mercury is highly toxic to animals, and we knew that humans have changed levels of environmental mercury,” Vo said.\n\nThe work analyzed levels of total mercury and of methyl mercury, a form of the element that is absorbed into an animal’s body. It also examined isotopes of carbon and nitrogen as a way to rule out the possibility that changes in the birds’ bodies were due to a shift in food sources. The research showed that the level at which the birds fed in the food chain didn’t change appreciably over time.\n\nBank said there had been speculation that mercury levels were rising in the Pacific, but the results provided confirmation.\n\n“We don’t have just a model, we have actual data,” Bank said.\n\nEdwards said the research highlights the value of museum collections. The birds in the MCZ’s ornithology collection, of which Edwards is curator, are commonly used by scholars to study their anatomy. But Edwards pointed out that their tissues also function as a time capsule for the world in which they lived.\n\n“The collections are key,” Edwards said. “These birds were collected without any … thought about mercury.”\n\nBank said the research built on the “ghost” of past collecting work.\n\n“We’ve harnessed the power of past expeditions,” Bank said.\n\nEdwards and Vo said there are several follow-up studies that could be undertaken, including on whether this level of mercury in the tissues is detrimental to the birds’ breeding.\n\n“We don’t really know if this has really impacted their reproductive success,” Edwards said. “I think there are some great follow-up studies to be done.”",

Krupke reminds farmers that there is no silver bullet to prevent all pests – even Bt.\n\nResistance in the U.S. seems to crop up in disconnected places, Krupke said. That means the pests are developing resistance independently, rather than a single pest with a genetic resistance spreading from state to state.\n\nA farmer who suspects resistance should rotate another crop next season, he said. If that’s not possible, he should rotate a variety with a different type of Bt protection – and make sure that the Bt trait is different since Monsanto and Syngenta varieties have the same Bt.\n\n“It’s manageable. We know what we can do. Farmers know good practices, like crop rotation. But people tend to get away from those practices when something works very, very well,” Krupke said.\n\n“The hybrid that got you into that situation should be swapped out,” he said.",

            "text": "The Association of Soybean and Corn Producers of the Mato Grosso, which calls itself Aprosoja-MT, is demanding that Monsanto, DuPont, Syngenta and Dow companies offer them some solutions as well as compensation for their loses due to the \"deceptive or false advertising\" (via Google translate) the companies engaged in when they \"promised something they didn't deliver.\"Farmers are talking about \"Bt corn,\" corn seeds genetically modified to produce a toxin that repels certain pests, and will supposedly protect against certain pests. But because of a failure of the corn to do what it was engineered to do, farmers ended up applying three additional coats of pesticides this year, adding to the cost of the crop itself, and adding additional stress to the environment.Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja farm lobby in Mato Grosso state said \"The caterpillars should die if they eat the corn, but since they didn't die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reais ($54) per hectare ... at a time that corn prices are terrible.\"Seed companies say they told the farmers to plant half their fields with regular unmodified seeds so that the pests wouldn't mutate and develop a resistance to the GMO seeds. In an email, Dow Agrosciences, a division of Dow Chemical Company said they have many programs in Brazil to help farmers develop \"an integrated pest management system that includes, among other things, the cultivation of refuge areas.\"Dupont, the makers of Pioneer brand seeds, says they have not heard anything from Aprosoja-MT about the problem, but said in a statement they have been \"working with producers to extend the durability of its seed technology and improve efficiency since Spodoptera worms were found to have developed resistance to the Cry1F protein.\"Tomczyk, speaking for the farmers, said area seed companies had not given clear instructions, and there were very little non-GMO seeds available to farmers. He went on to say that if an agreement can't be reached between the companies and the farmers group, they might have to sue for reparations for the cost of the pesticides.The problem with GMO seeds arose in the United States earlier this year when it was proven the corn-destroying rootworm had grown resistant to the Bt corn. American farmers, by the droves turned their backs on GMO seeds, most saying it just wasn't profitable anymore.Farmers discovered pretty quickly they get paid more for conventional corn, and it produces more per acre than GMO corn. “Five years ago the [GMO seeds] worked,” said farmer Christ Huegerich, who along with his father planted GMO seeds. “I didn’t have corn rootworm because of the Bt gene, and I used less pesticide. Now, the worms are adjusting, and the weeds are resistant. Mother Nature adapts.”This adaption by nature to the Cry1F protein in Bt corn has only made the chemical companies all the more intent on modification of pests and weeds instead of encouraging biodiversity. In an industry sponsored study reported in the non-profit GM Watch , it was found that pests in Brazil were becoming resistant to Bt maize 1507 only three years after the GMO corn seed was approved for use.The study, \"Brazil: Pest resistance to Bt maize 1507 in third year of cultivation,\" submitted by Testbiotech, of Munich, Germany on July 23, 2014 describes the withdrawal of Bt maize 1507 from Puerto Rico in 2008 when it was discovered the GMO corn seed was not doing what it had been engineered to do. The study further points to the same thing happening in Brazil, with pests becoming resistant to the toxin.The conclusion of Testbiotech is that the approval process of maize 1507 be halted because of the number of fundamental data gaps pertaining to risk management. The study may end up being helpful to the farmers of Brazil in getting a just compensation from some very big corporations.",

report on write about and analyze minnesotabased retailer target corp particular as it pertains to its fairly new fresh food and grocery initiative pfresh were avid and aggressive target watchers our coverage of minneapolisbased target includes an ongoing research project in which weve been tracking identifying reporting on and writing about the growth of the chains instore pfresh food and grocery markets which the retailer has been adding to many of its 1500plus discount format stores in the us beginning in 2009 target corp has two retail formats its discount stores which are the majority of its units and its supertarget format stores which are similar in size to a walmart supercenter and include a full supermarket inside like walmarts supecenter format target which is the second largest retailer in the us after walmart stores inc currently has pfresh fresh food and grocery markets inside about 350 of its us discount format stores and plans to add the markets to another 400 units this year and as we pointed out here in 2010 california is the leading us state in terms of the number of its discount stores out of the 350 target has added the pfresh units inside of over the last nearly two years over 100 of the 350 pfresh units are in california because were avid and aggressive target watchers here at fresh easy buzz the retailers announcement today that its buying leasehold interests in up to 220 zellers discount store locations in canada for 185 billion didnt come as a surprise to us in the least bit zellers is a discountmassmerchant store format thats similar to targets discount store format target ceo gregg steinhafel said in a statement today the retailer plans to open 100 to 150 stores across canada in 2013 and 2014 it will renovate some of the zellers locations at an estimated cost of more than 1 billion he said other target stores in canada will be built fromthegroundup target announced its plans to enter canada last year you can read todays announcement from target corp here zellers parent company canadas hudsons bay company hbc also issued a statement on the deal today here no surprise why werent we surprised by todays announcement because target corps interest in zellers which is owned by canadas oldest company hudsons bay company hbc isnt a recent phenomenon target looked into acquiring the entire zellers chain and had talks with hbcs management at least as far back as 20062007 the discussions between the target corp and hbczellers folks obviously didnt result in a deal back then for a number of reasons one reason being target corp determined at the time that the timing wasnt right for it to either enter canada or make such a major acquisition target announced its plans to enter canada last year however the relationships formed at that time continued right up until now and although no deal was done back then target didnt walk away from its research on and investigation in zellers emptyhanded zellers the neighbourhood market one of the things target executives found interesting when they toured zellers stores was that the general merchandise retailer was testing a concept in a few of its stores called the neighbourhood market a fresh food and grocery storewithinastore zellers which first tested its instore markets in 20002001 currently has the neighborhood marketwhich ranges in size from about 5000 to 10000 squarefeet depending on the particular store its in in 90 of its discount stores located in a variety of provinces in canada click here to see the locations of the zellers stores with the neighbourhood market the canadian retailers policy over the last few years has been to add the food and grocery markets inside every new discount store it builds and every existing store it remodels which is something is started doing in 2002 pictured above a pfresh instore food and grocery market located in a target discount store in california pictured below an instore the neighbourhood market in a winnepeg canada zellers store note take a look at the nearidentical departmental circular ceiling signs at the top in both photographs kissing cousins the instore markets which are located in the front of the stores offer a limited assortment of fresh foods produce meats baked goods dairydeli prepared foods and shelfstable packaged food and grocery items just like targets pfresh and tescos 10000 squarefoot fresh easy neighborhood market stores in the us the first of which opened in november 2007 there are currently 156 fresh easy stores in california nevada and arizona the tesco fresh easy stores are freestanding units however not storeswithinstores like targets and zellers concepts are zellers had its the neighbourhood market concept inside a number of its discount stores in canada well before 2007 by 20032004 however in fact word is tesco did some scouting around in canada as well as the research it did in the us prior to creating fresh easy neighborhood market fact tescos original name for the chain was fresh easy community markets but the united kingdombased retailer changed community to neighborhood sometime in 20062007 observation if youre wondering why zellers uses the british spelling and french englishusage spelling of neighbourhood rather than using the north american spelling neighborhood a little research into the origins of zellers parent company hudsons bay which is canadas oldest company and the largest general merchandise retailer in the country among other things will make the choice of spelling clear also although english is the majority language canada officially remains a dual englishfrench language nation kissing cousins target opened its first pfresh instore markets in midtolate 2009 zellers has been adding its the neighbourhood market to its department stores at a fairly rapid pace over the last few years it has the markets in 90 of its discount stores so far click here to see a list of zellers stores that include the fresh food and grocery markets target executives first saw zellers food and grocery concept upclose a few years ago also keep in mind that minnesota where target corp is headquartered is really close to canada target created its pfresh concept and initiative a fresh food and grocery storewithinastore inside their target discount format stores in late 2008 and launch it in 2009 the pfresh stores are much larger than zellers instore markets nearly three times the size both retailers markets feature the same product categories target though offers a much more extensive number of skus than does zellers but the model is identical additionally targets instore pfresh signage and related graphics look very close to what zellers uses and it was first remember with its the neighbourhood market armed now with the information in this story if you go visit a target discount store in the us that has a pfresh inside then go visit a zellers store in canada with a the neighbourhood market inside we bet youll see the connection and perhaps even say kissing cousins they are the deal target is a better overall retailer including in the food and grocery segment although target has plenty of room to get better at grocery merchandising than zellers is targets format and stores are also much better overall zellers has been remodeling some of its discount stores in canada over the last couple years but many consumers in the country feel the retailer has become outdated both in how the stores look and how they are merchandised and the rapid growth of walmartcanada has taken a toll on zellers which before walmart headed north from the us was the firstchoice of many canadian shoppers in many parts of canada walmartcanada has made zellers the secondor even third choice for many canadian shoppers under the terms of the deal target plans to make payments to hbczellers for the leases through 2011 zellers will sublease the sites from target and keep running stores under its own banner for a period of time target and hbczellers said in the statements today a good translation of for a period of time is once target takes over all of the zellers stores out of the 220 it intends to in the 20132014 time period the zellers chain and banner will cease to exist in canada or anywhere else in our analysis the deal is a good one both for target and for hbczellers canadians travel to the us regularly because of the close proximity of the two countries after all you can drive from parts of canada into parts of the us like minnesota faster than you can fly from the west coast to the east coast many are very familiar with target and of course we arent suggesting target wants zellers for its instore food and grocery markets they are merely part of the package its a back story and a connection not mentioned in any of the many stories being published on the deal kissing cousins united lastly now that you know about the targetzellers instore fresh food and grocery market connection were betting you know what were going to tell you next well its simply that targets pfresh fresh food and grocery markets are going to be in all or most of those up to 150 stores it plans to open in canada in 20132014 including the zellers stores it takes over along with any stores it builds from scratch and now you knowthe rest of the target corphbczellers deal story or at least the back story as it pertains to food and grocery merchandising and retailing",

            "url": "http://rt.com/news/monsanto-brazil-seed-soy-908/", 
            "text": "Five million Brazilian farmers are locked in a lawsuit with US-based biotech giant Monsanto, suing for as much as 6.2 billion euros. They say that the genetic-engineering company has been collecting royalties on crops it unfairly claims as its own.\n\nThe farmers claim that Monsanto unfairly collects exorbitant profits every year worldwide on royalties from “renewal” seed harvests. “Renewal” crops are those that have been planted using seed from the previous year’s harvest. While the practice of renewal farming is an ancient one, Monsanto disagrees, demanding royalties from any crop generation produced from its genetically-engineered seed. Because the engineered seed is patented, Monsanto not only charges an initial royalty on the sale of the crop produced, but a continuing 2 per cent royalty on every subsequent crop, even if the farmer is using a later generation of seed.\n\n\"Monsanto gets paid when it sell the seeds. The law gives producers the right to multiply the seeds they buy and nowhere in the world is there a requirement to pay (again). Producers are in effect paying a private tax on production,\" Jane Berwanger, lawyer for the farmers told the Associated Press reports.\n\nIn the latest installment of the legal battle erupting in South America, the Brazilian court has ruled in favor of the Brazilian farmers, saying Monsanto owes them at least US$2 billion paid since 2004. Monsanto, however, has appealed the decision and the case is ongoing. \n\n\n\nIn essence, Monsanto argues that once a farmer buys their seed, they have to pay the global bio-tech giant a yearly fee in perpetuity – with no way out. \n\n\n\nAt stake is Brazil’s highly profitable and ever growing soybean production. Last year, Brazil was the world's second producer and exporter of soybean behind the United States, according to the AFP report. The crops can be used for anything from animal feed to bio fuel, and worldwide demand is growing.\n\nGenetically engineered soy first appeared illegally in Brazil in the 1990’s, smuggled in from neighboring Argentina. The Brazilian farmers found the seed attractive despite the ban in place from the Brazilian authorities because Monsanto had specifically designed the seed to be resistant to its own immensely powerful and popular herbicide Roundup. \n\n\n\nWhen used in tandem, the strong herbicide will kill the weeds while allowing the soy crops to grow unimpeded. After the ban was lifted, genetically modified seed flooded the Brazilian market, and now 85 per cent of the Brazilian soy crop is genetically-engineered. Soy has been extremely successful in Brazil, currently making up 26 per cent of the country’s farm exports last year and netting Brazil a total of $24.1 billion, according to AP. However, Brazil’s farmers were apparently unaware there would be a heavy price to pay. \n\n\n\nTo make a deal with Monsanto is to make a deal with a company that is one the most powerful and pervasive food giants in the world. It is the world’s number one seed developer, and its patented genes have been inserted into 95 per cent of all American soy, and 80 per cent of all American corn crops. Monsanto has repeatedly levied large damage suits against independent farmers that have unknowingly or unwittingly used their seed. \n\n\n\nAnd Monsanto’s reach goes far beyond agriculture.\n\nMonsanto is also the world’s largest manufacturer of synthetic bovine growth hormone, injected into cows in order to stimulate greater milk production. The widespread pressure by the company to use the chemical and the subsequent measures taken by Monsanto to suppress information regarding the potential health risks sparked uproar among American farmers. \n\n\n\nWhen dairy producers that did not use Monsanto’s products began labeling their products as “Hormone Free” or “Organic”, Monsanto slapped them with a lawsuit as recently as 2008, claiming the labels amounted to negative advertising against hormone-produced milk.\n\nDirector of corporate communications for Monsanto, Phil Angell, summed up Monsanto’s take on the issue in a report by food author Michael Pollan for New York Times Magazine in 1998: \"Monsanto should not have to vouch for the safety of biotech food. Our interest is in selling as much of it as possible. Assuring its safety is FDA's job.\"",

            "text": "Study led by Ding Xue pinpoints prime targets of virus in liver cells\n\nA research team led by University of Colorado scientists has discovered two prime targets of the hepatitis B virus in liver cells -- and the findings could be a breakthrough leading to treatment of the disease affecting more than 400 million people worldwide.\n\nFor more than three decades, scientists have been trying to find the cellular targets of the hepatitis B virus, said CU professor Ding Xue, who led the study.\n\nResearchers have known that the virus encodes a pathogenic protein -- known as HBx -- allowing tumors to flourish. But how that protein operates has remained largely unknown until now.\n\n\"This provides a lot of opportunities for clinical therapeutics to treat hepatitis B,\" Xue said of the findings from two studies he led that were published Monday.\n\nAlthough there is a hepatitis vaccine available that has curbed infection rates in the United States, the virus remains a health threat in developing countries, said Xue, of CU's molecular, cellular and developmental biology department.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates 600,000 people die every year from acute or chronic hepatitis B virus infection, which is most predominant in Asia and Africa.\n\nThe virus can cause liver inflammation, scarring and cancer. It's transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, unprotected sex, unsterile needles and from an infected mother to her children during birth.\n\nIn the two new studies, Xue and his research team showed that the host targets of HBx in human cells are two small proteins, identified as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.\n\nThose cells are known as cell death inhibitors but had not previously been linked to hepatitis B infections. Scientists found that HBx uses a string of amino acids to interact with the Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL targets and set off a spike of calcium in the host cell.\n\nThe elevation in calcium triggers viral hepatitis B replication and cell death, Xue said. When the researchers introduced gene mutations in the sequence, HBx binded to the Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins and viral replication was stymied. When those proteins were knocked out or weakened in liver cells, HBx was less able to cause an increase in calcium and viral replication from within the infected cells.\n\nThe two papers on the subject were published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In addition to major CU-Boulder co-authors Xin Geng, Brian Harry, Qinghua Zhou, Yan Qin and Amy Palmer, a group led by professor Ning-Shao Xia from the National Institute of Diagnostics and Vaccine Development in Infectious Diseases at Xiamen University in China collaborated on one of the studies.\n\nHarry said the hepatitis B vaccine, which was developed in 1982, is administered around the world and has been shown to work well in preventing new infections.\n\n\"The problem is that once you are infected, there is no effective way to remove the virus from the body,\" he said in a news release. \"When the virus replicates in liver cells, it causes cycles of cellular damage, inflammation and tissue regeneration, resulting in the accumulation of genetic mutations and liver cancer.\"",

Ricardo Tomczyk, the president of the farm lobby, said producers want the manufacturers of the Bt corn seeds to reimburse them for the cost of spraying up to three coats of pesticides this year. \"The caterpillars should die if they eat the corn, but since they didn't die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reais (US$54) per hectare ... at a time that corn prices are terrible,\" he said. The seed companies say they warned Brazilian farmers to plant conventional seeds on part of their corn fields to prevent resistance from developing. Tomczyk said that Aprosoja had encouraged the planting of refuge areas, but argued the seed companies did not give clear instructions. \"There are barely any non-GMO seeds available ... it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers,\" he said. He said his organization hopes to reach a negotiated agreement with the companies, but it all else fails, the farmers may sue to get reparations for pesticide costs.\n\nThe original article may still be available at http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/28/brazil-corn-pests-idUSL2N0Q327P20140728",

            "body": "july 2012 miracle mineral supplement mms theres every reason to be concerned about such things as ge contamination of conventional andor organic crops and the many riders in the farm bill that will give the biotech industry carte blanche with their inventions and institute a legal limit for ge contamination in all foods not only do we need genetically engineered foods to be labeled but we also must protect the ability to produce noncontaminated alternatives because contrary to industry propaganda which in no way is anchored in rigorous nonbiased science genetically engineered foods have been linked to a wide variety of health problems in independentlyfunded studies for example a study published in the international journal of biological sciences in 2009 13 found that three of monsantos genetically engineered corn varieties caused organ damage the ge corn tested included at the time the study was the first and the most comprehensive of its kind according to the inquisitr 14 gilleseric s jul 31 by dr mercola if youve ever wondered how monsantoa company that admits it wants to own the worlds food supply through its patented genetically engineered seedsgets away with not having to label its products all you have to do is follow the trail of money leading from their coffers into the pockets and campaign funds of wellplaced politicians and regulators according to opensecretsorg 1 monsanto basically lives at the doorsteps of legislators in washington where it spent 53 million last year lobbying the nations lawmakers and has already spent 14 million in the first three months of this year needless to say they can afford it according to opensecretsorg monsanto had an annual revenue of 118 billion last year so a 53 million lobbying investment is far less than one percent of one percent of their revenues the influence theyre trying to buy doesnt stop in congress though monsantos legislative agenda also includes the us department of agriculture usda the food and drug administration fda and the environmental protection agency epa all of which have a say in whether or not you get to know whether the food youre eating has been genetically engineered can you trust a system powered by lobbying the power of monsanto can be seen through its contributions to rep frank d lucas whos received the most money so far from monsanto lucas just happens to be chairman of the house agriculture committee through which every farmrelated piece of legislation must pass but hes certainly not the only one wheel getting greased by this biotech giant according to opensecretsorg so far this election cycle monsantos pac has given 77500 to 17 members of the house agriculture committee or their leadership pacs monsantos interests in washington are diverse it lobbied bills ranging from the american research and competitiveness act of 2011 2 which would extend tax credits for companies doing research to several bills that would change the way the department of homeland security handles security at chemical facilities chemicals being a big part of monsantos product portfolio another upcoming matter of great interest to monsanto the new farm bill an omnibus piece of legislation that sets the nations agricultural policy and deals with nearly every aspect of the countrys farming and food industries the current bill expires in 2013 when it went through congress monsanto filed more lobbying reports on it than any other organization the process of piecing together a new proposal is already well under way such lobbying efforts can and do have a tremendous impact on the lives and health of every american not to mention the environment it directly impacts the food you end up with on your plate and whether or not youre allowed to know whats in the food you eat to begin with monsanto and other biotech companies involved with genetic engineering of crop seeds are currently fighting tooth and nail to prevent labeling of genetically engineered foods knowing full well that such a label has the potential to destroy their burgeoning industry why monsanto always wins last year monsanto lobbied congress and the us department of agriculture concerning regulations that would affect genetically engineered crops such as the companys roundup ready soybeans and alfalfa as a result genetically engineered alfalfa was deregulated despite strong opposition from the organic industry and massive public outcry an interesting article from last year by mike ludwig titled why monsanto always wins sheds light on the shady approval process of genetically engineered crops 3 according to ludwig theres evidence of cooperation between federal regulators and the biotech industry that crosses the line of acceptable involvement during the regulatory review he also cites bill freese a policy analyst with cfs who told truthout that the approval process for controversial genetically engineered ge crops like roundup ready alfalfa is basically a sham designed to increase consumer confidence in the controversial ge crops and that in his years of battling against biotech he cant remember a single case when regulators failed to eventually grant approval of a ge crop to get an idea of just how broad and deep monsantos reach is take a look at the following chart over the years this biotech giant has successfully infiltrated an ever increasing number of highlevel federal regulatory positions in the us government many of which are positions meant to protect your food safety crazy patent laws prevent independent researchers from studying ge hazards to give you another example of how monsanto has been able to carefully position itself and its wares into a nearinvincible position consider this the reason why genetically engineered food hazards have never been studied beyond 30 days nor are currently being studied is because the corporations controlling the patented seeds such as monsanto are allowed to prevent independent studies per current patent laws thats right genetically engineered foods are patented inventions protected under copyright and proprietary information laws and the corporations controlling the seeds only allow them to be studied under very limited conditions and rarely if ever do they permit them to be studied for safety by anyone but the usdawhich conveniently has not yet seen the need to conduct rigorous longterm safety studies on genetically engineered foods 4 how monsanto is now positioned to potentially decimate africa monsantos political influence clearly reaches far beyond our us borders most recently in an effort to end hunger in africa the obama administration drafted some of the worlds largest food and finance companies to invest in projects all over the continent 5 much of the 3 billion effort will go toward developing seeds and fertilizers and building silos for storage to do this the president has rounded up the usual suspects which includes monsanto however unlike the us some donor countries are insisting that their money be spent on traditional food handouts instead of genetically engineered monoculture such as that offered by tanseed a tanzanian seed company that will spend 11 million buying certified seed to be sold in little packets to small farmers still the evidence tells us genetically engineered crops can not coexist with organic or conventional crops they usually end up contaminating nearby fields turning those farmers into patentinfringing criminals in the processa scenario no farmer on any continent could ever have imagined a couple of decades ago another project seeking to establish genetically engineered crops in africa is the alliance for a green revolution in africa agra through this alliance heavyweights like monsanto and other biotech companies along with the gates foundation are foolishly promoting ge crops as the answer to africas hunger problem but donating patented seeds which takes away the farmers sovereignty is not the way to save the thirdworld poor the gates foundation has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to agra and in 2006 robert horsch was hired for the project horsch was a monsanto executive for 25 years in a nutshell the project may be sold under the banner of altruism and sustainability but in reality its anything but its just a multibillion dollar enterprise to transform africa into a gecropfriendly continent in the end such humanitarian efforts are doomed to fail while allowing big biotech to make obscene profits at the poors expense african farmers will likely encounter the same problems as those in india where farmers growing genetically engineered crops have been committing suicide due to financial hardships at a rate of one farmer taking his own life every 30 minutes brazilian farmers sue monsanto for unfair and exorbitant profits a recent lawsuit against monsanto by brazilian farmers also highlights the harsh economic realities for farmers who take up growing genetically engineered crops according to a recent rt news article 6 five million brazilian farmers are locked in a lawsuit with usbased biotech giant monsanto suing for as much as 62 billion euros the farmers claim that monsanto unfairly collects exorbitant profits every year worldwide on royalties from renewal seed harvests renewal crops are those that have been planted using seed from the previous years harvest while the practice of renewal farming is an ancient one monsanto disagrees demanding royalties from any crop generation produced from its geneticallyengineered seed because the engineered seed is patented monsanto not only charges an initial royalty on the sale of the crop produced but a continuing 2 per cent royalty on every subsequent crop even if the farmer is using a later generation of seed monsanto gets paid when it sell the seeds the law gives producers the right to multiply the seeds they buy and nowhere in the world is there a requirement to pay again producers are in effect paying a private tax on production jane berwanger lawyer for the farmers told the associated press reports in the latest installment of the legal battle erupting in south america the brazilian court has ruled in favor of the brazilian farmers saying monsanto owes them at least us2 billion paid since 2004 monsanto however has appealed the decision and the case is ongoing in essence monsanto argues that once a farmer buys their seed they have to pay the global biotech giant a yearly fee in perpetuity with no way out why we need labeling of genetically engineered foods in the us labeling genetically engineered foods is likely the best shot we have at circumventing monsantos powergrabbing ways and stopping the unchecked proliferation of genetically engineered foods this is why we strongly support state initiatives such as californias 2012 ballot initiative to require genetically engineered foods sold in the state to be labeled as consumers we all have a right to know whats in our food this is a powerful strategy that could have the impact of a national law why because large food companies are unlikely to have dual labeling one for california and another for the rest of the country it would be very expensive not to mention a logistical and pr nightmare to avoid the dual labeling many would likely opt to ditch genetically engineered ingredients from their products entirely this is why supporting this initiative is so important as victory in california will likely eliminate most genetically engineered foods from the rest of the us as well powerful confirmation of this belief occurred earlier this year when both cocacola company and pepsico inc chose to alter one of their soda ingredients as a result of californias labeling requirements for carcinogens 7 this is a perfect example of the national impact a california ge labeling requirement can and no doubt will have while california is the only state requiring the label to state that the product contains the offending ingredient these companies are switching their formula for the entire us market rather than have two different labels cocacola co and pepsico inc are changing the way they make the caramel coloring used in their sodas as a result of a california law that mandates drinks containing a certain level of carcinogens bear a cancer warning label the companies said the changes will be expanded nationally to streamline their manufacturing processes theyve already been made for drinks sold in california aaem recommends gmo free diet as you may recall two years ago the american academy of environmental medicine aaem called on all physicians to prescribe diets without genetically engineered foods to all patients 8 but youd be hardpressed to find a doctor who is aware of andor actually follows this recommendation at that time the aaem called for a moratorium on genetically engineered foods longterm independent studies and labeling stating several animal studies indicate serious health risks associated with gm food including infertility immune problems accelerated aging insulin regulation and changes in major organs and the gastrointestinal system there is more than a casual association between genetically modified foods and adverse health effects there is causation learn more about genetically engineered foods due to lack of labeling many americans are still unfamiliar with what genetically engineered foods are we have a plan to change that and i urge you to participate and to continue learning more about genetically engineered foods and helping your friends and family do the same your best strategy is to simply buy usda 100 organic products whenever possible as these do not permit genetically engineered ingredients or buy whole fresh produce and meat from local farmers the majority of the genetically engineered organisms gmos youre exposed to are via processed foods so by cooking from scratch with whole foods you can be sure youre not inadvertently consuming something laced with altered ingredients when you do purchase processed food avoid products containing anything related to corn or soy that are not usda certified to be 100 percent organic as any foods containing these two nonorganic ingredients are almost guaranteed to contain genetically engineered ingredients as well as toxic herbicide residues to learn more about genetically engineered foods i highly recommend perusing the many videos and lectures available on the irt site please continue supporting californias ballot initiative to label gmos the california right to know genetically engineered food act 9 has already been submitted to the state attorney general the next step is the campaigning remember if california can get the law passed in november its going to have the same impact as national law for the reasons i mentioned earlier its going to be an enormous battle as the biotech industry will outspend us by 100 to 1 if not more for their propaganda so needless to say the campaign needs funds if you have the ability i strongly encourage you to make a donation i urge you to get involved and help in any way you can be assured that what happens in california will affect the remainder of the us states so please support this important state initiative even if you do not live there if you live in california and want to get involved please contact labelgmosorg pamm larry will go through all volunteer requests to put you into a position that is suitable for you based on your stated interests and location no matter where you live please help spread the word in your personal networks on facebook and twitter for help with the messaging please see labelgmosorgs spread the word page whether you live in california or not please donate money to this historic effort via the organic consumers fund talk to organic producers and stores and ask them to actively support the california ballot it may be the only chance we have to label genetically engineered foods for timely updates please join the organic consumers association on facebook or follow them on twitter look for indepth

nbc news reported that 1 the us is on course for a record year for whooping cough health officials said this week and while vaccinating kids is clearly the most important defense health experts say adults may not realize theyre supposed to be getting regular shots too the article goes on to hype what are actually predictable pertussis whooping cough increases and promote the ineffective pertussis vaccinebasically giving the media their marching orders for this falls propaganda campaign which centers on blaming increases in pertussis on parents who file nonmedical exemptions for their kids which is pure nonsense surprise whooping cough spreads mainly through vaccinated populations in 2010 the largest outbreak of whooping cough in over 50 years occurred in california around that same time a scare campaign was launched in the california by pharmafunded medical trade associations state health officials and national media targeting people opting out of receiving pertussis vaccine falsely accusing them of causing the outbreak however research published in march of this year paints a very different picture than the one spread by the media 2 in fact the study showed that 81 percent of 2010 california whooping cough cases in people under the age of 18 occurred in those who were fully up to date on the whooping cough vaccine eleven percent had received at least one shot but not the entire recommended series and only eight percent of those stricken were unvaccinated according to the authors 3 this first detailed analysis of a recent north american pertussis outbreak found widespread disease among fully vaccinated older children starting approximately three years after prior vaccine dose attack rates markedly increased suggesting inadequate protection or durability from the acellular vaccine emphasis mine the pertussis whooping cough vaccine is included as a component in combination shots that include tetanus and diphtheria dpt dtap tdap and may also include polio hepatitis b andor haemophilus influenza b hib cdc data shows 84 percent of children under the age of three have received at least four dtap shotswhich is the acellular pertussis vaccine that was approved in the united states in 1996yet despite this high vaccination rate whooping cough still keeps circulating among both the vaccinated and unvaccinated so as clearly evidenced in this study the vaccine likely provides very little if any protection from the disease in fact the research suggests those who are fully vaccinated may in fact be more likely to get the disease than unvaccinated populations why do pertussis vaccines fail despite claimed efficacy interestingly in a recent article published in the journal pediatrics 4 author james d cherry md reveals that estimates for pertussis vaccine efficacy have been significantly inflated due to the case definitions adopted by the world health organization who in 1991 which required laboratory confirmation and 21 days or more of paroxysmal cough all less severe cases were excluded he states i was a member of the who committee and disagreed with the primary case definition because it was clear at that time that this definition would eliminate a substantial number of cases and therefore inflate reported efficacy values nevertheless the center for biologics evaluation and research of the food and drug administration accepted this definition and package inserts of the uslicensed dtap vaccines reflect this for example infanrix and daptacel have stated efficacies of 84 and 85 respectively when less severe cough illness is included however the efficacies of these 2 vaccines decrease to 71 and 78 respectively in addition even these latter efficacies are likely inflated owing to investigator or parental compliance with the study protocol observer bias dr cherry lists eight potential reasons for why the efficacy of pertussis vaccines are overestimated overexpectation of efficacy because of case definition inflated estimates of efficacy because of observer bias other bordetella sp are the cause of similar cough illnesses lack of initial potency decay in antibody over time incomplete antigen package incorrect balance of antigens in the vaccine genetic changes in b pertussis whooping cough is cyclical disease b pertussis whooping cough is a cyclical disease with natural increases that tend to occur every 45 years no matter how high the vaccination rate is in a population using dptdtap or tdap vaccines on a widespread basis whole cell dpt vaccines used in the us from the 1950s until the late 1990s were estimated to be 63 to 94 percent effective and studies showed that vaccineacquired immunity fell to about 40 percent after seven years in the study cited above the researchers noted the vaccines effectiveness was only 41 percent among 2 to 7yearolds and a dismal 24 percent among those aged 812 5 with this shockingly low rate of dtap vaccine effectiveness the questionable solution public health officials have come up with is to declare that everybody has to get three primary shots and three followup booster shots in order to get longlasting protection 6 and thats provided the vaccine gives you any protection at all why cocooning vaccines does not work additionally in a futile effort to address the outbreak the american academy of pediatrics aap started directing physicians particularly pediatricians to offer tdap vaccine to parents and close family members of babies under age 2 months who are too young to receive a pertussiscontaining vaccine themselves in a recent study on this topic the researchers concluded the parental cocoon program is inefficient and resource intensive for the prevention of serious outcomes in early infancy cocooning is a controversial practice and is being promoted by the aap and government health officials as a way of protecting babies from whooping cough and other infectious diseases like influenza by vaccinating their parents and other adult caregivers however there is little evidence to show that this works in fact research from canada has demonstrated just the opposite published last year this canadian study investigated how many parents would need to be vaccinated in order to prevent infant hospitalizations and deaths from pertussis using the cocoon strategy 7 and the results were dismal they found the number needed to vaccinate nnv for parental immunization was at least one million to prevent one infant death approximately 100000 for icu admission and 10000 for hospitalization also confirmed us varicella vaccination program is a total flop in related vaccine news a recent review of the us varicella chickenpox vaccination program published in may in the journal vaccine 8 concluded the vaccine has not proven to be costeffective increased the incidence of shingles failed to provide longterm protection from the disease it targetschicken poxand is less effective than the natural immunity that existed in the general population before the vaccine here vaccine efficacy is again questioned as the efficacy of the varicella vaccine was found to have declined well below 80 percent by of 2002 the information was gathered from a review of chicken pox and shingles statistics in the years since the vaccine was introduced the researchers point out that although statistics showed shingles rates increased after the vaccine cdc authorities still claimed that no increase had occurred the authors also state that the cdc not only ignored the natural boost in immunity to the community that occurred with wild chickenpox as opposed to the vaccine but also ignored the rare serious events following varicella vaccination as well as the increasing rates of shingles among adults in the prelicensure era 95 of adults experienced natural chickenpox usually as childrenthese cases were usually benign and resulted in longterm immunity varicella vaccination is less effective than the natural immunity that existed in prevaccine communities universal varicella vaccination has not proven to be costeffective as increased herpes zoster shingles morbidity has disproportionately offset cost savings associated with reductions in varicella disease universal varicella vaccination has failed to provide longterm protection from vzv disease emphasis mine ridiculous claims about herd immunity achieved by hpv vaccine according to a report in the journal pediatrics 9 which has been praised in major media like discover magazine 10 the quadravalent vaccine for hpv gardasil appears to be protecting young people that havent even been vaccinated with it not only that gardasil has accomplished this amazing feat in just four yearslong before most vaccines begin to show any sign of whats known as herd immunity the study looked at rates of hpv infection in a small group of teens and young women at two primary care clinics and found that infections from the cancercausing hpv strain had declined apparently they also observed that infections in women who had not been vaccinated had also declined the team concluded the overall decline in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated must have been due to the vaccine as per discover magazine if the news pans out to be true in further research it will be pretty exciting indeed if this is true it would be an outright miracle considering the fact that this theory is beyond ludicrous consider that claim in light of these facts in the study 59 percent of participants at two primary care clinics received the hpv vaccine according to 2008 survey statistics an estimated 25 percent of american adolescents 13 to 17 years old had received at least one dose of the hpv vaccine and a mere 11 percent had received all 3 doses 11 by 2010 the vaccine uptake estimates had nearly doubled with 48 percent of girls between the ages of 13 and 17 having received at least one dose of the hpv vaccine 12 it is typically taught that the vaccine acquired herd immunity threshold is anywhere between 8095 percent of the population depending on the disease so how could the hpv vaccine confer herd immunity when on a nationwide basis less than half of teens and young women have received the vaccine and the vast majority of those have only received onethird of the recommended number of doses whenever an outbreak of disease occurs government health officials are always quick to point the finger at those who are unvaccinated stating that its because of them that vaccine induced herd immunity was not achieved thereby allowing the disease to flourish although they rarely if ever offer an explanation for why so many vaccinated people get sick when they should theoretically be immune for most diseases vaccineinduced herd immunity can not be achieved unless 8095 percent of the population is vaccinated against the disease in question so truly for the hpv vaccine to suddenly confer herd immunity at less than 50 percent coverage would be nothing short of a miracle this study is nothing but marketing masquerading as science discover magazine also didnt mention the fact that at least five individuals on the sevenmember team making these overthetop claims are paid speakers and consultants for merck or have received research funds from merck to develop this vaccinemeaning this wasnt exactly an independent outside group with no conflicting interests in the outcome please also note that the president of the merck vaccine division julie gerberding is the former head of the cdc discover also didnt mention that the rates of the rates of sexual activitythe primary way hpv is spreadhad also declined during the years of the study period which could indicate that the reason hpv infection rates went down was not herd immunity acquired from the vaccine but rather that fewer young people were having sex what you need to know about herd immunity the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases describes vaccineinduced herd immunity also labeled community immunity by public health doctors as follows 13 when a critical portion of a community is immunized against a contagious disease most members of the community are protected against that disease because there is little opportunity for an outbreak even those who are not eligible for certain vaccinessuch as infants pregnant women or immunocompromised individualsget some protection because the spread of contagious disease is contained this is known as community immunity the problem is that there is in fact such a thing as natural herd immunity but what theyve done is theyve taken this natural phenomenon and assumed that vaccines will work the same way however vaccines do not confer the same kind of immunity as experiencing the natural disease and the science clearly shows that theres a big difference between naturally acquired herd immunity and vaccineinduced herd immunity to learn more i urge you to listen to the following video in which barbara loe fisher cofounder and president of the national vaccine information center nvic discusses the concept of herd immunity download interview transcript barbara explains the original concept of herd immunity is that when a population experiences the natural disease natural immunity would be achieved a robust qualitatively superior natural herd immunity within the population which would then protect other people from getting the disease in other age groups its the way infectious diseases work the vaccinologists have adopted this idea of vaccine induced herd immunity the problem with it is that all vaccines only confer temporary protection pertussis vaccine is one the best examples pertussis vaccines have been used for about 50 to 60 years and the organism has started to evolve to become vaccine resistant i think this is not something thats really understood generally by the public vaccines do not confer the same type of immunity that natural exposure to the disease does vaccine professionals would like you to believe they are the same but theyre qualitatively two entirely different types of immune responses in most cases natural exposure to disease would give you a longer lasting more robust qualitatively superior immunity because it gives you both cell mediated immunity and humoral immunity barbara explains humoral is the antibody production the way you measure vaccineinduced immunity is by how high the antibody titers are how many antibodies you have basically but the problem is the cell mediated immunity is very important as well most vaccines evade cell mediated immunity and go straight for the antibodies which is only one part of immunity thats been the big problem with the production of vaccines vaccines are designed to trick your bodys immune system into producing protective antibodies needed to resist any future infection however your body is smarter than that the artificial stimulation of your immune system produced by lab altered bacteria and viruses simply does not replicate the exact response that your immune system mounts when naturally encountering the infectious microorganism according to barbara the fact that manmade vaccines can not replicate the bodys natural experience with the disease is one of the key points of contention between those who insist that mankind can not live without mass use of multiple vaccines and those who believe that mankinds biological integrity will be severely compromised by their continued use is it better to protect children against infectious disease early in life through temporary immunity from a vaccine or are they better off contracting certain contagious infections in childhood and attaining permanent immunity do vaccine complications ultimately cause more chronic illness and death than infectious diseases do these questions essentially pit trust in human intervention against trust in nature and the natural order which existed long before vaccines were created by man vaccines causing dangerous mutations the fact that many vaccines are ineffective is becoming increasingly apparent merck has recently been slapped with two separate class action lawsuits contending they lied about the effectiveness of the mumps vaccine in their combination mmr shot and fabricated efficacy studies to maintain the illusion for the past two decades that the vaccine is highly protective in australia dangerous new strains of whooping cough bacteria were reported in march 2012 14 the vaccine researchers said was responsible the reason for this is because while whooping cough is primarily attributed to bordetella pertussis infection it is also caused by another closely related pathogen called b parapertussis which the vaccine does not protect against two years earlier scientists at penn state had already reported that the pertussis vaccine significantly enhanced the colonization of b parapertussis thereby promoting vaccineresistant whooping cough outbreaks 15 according to the authors vaccination led to a 40fold enhancement of b parapertussis colonization in the lungs of mice though the mechanism behind this increased colonization was not specifically elucidated it is speculated to involve specific immune responses skewed or dampened by the acellular vaccine including cytokine and antibody production during infection despite this vaccine being hugely effective against b pertussis which was once the primary childhood killer these data suggest that the vaccine may be contributing to the observed rise in whooping cough incidence over the last decade by promoting b parapertussis infection emphasis mine despite this a spokeswoman for the australian department of health and ageing stated that suboptimal vaccine coverage was among the possible reasons for why whooping cough had increased sevenfold in australia since 2007 but if the vaccine doesnt work and in fact promotes vaccineresistant disease outbreaks then why would increasing vaccine rates make a positive difference this rationale is completely nonsensical as it stands to reason that increasing vaccine coverage would then actually lead to increasingly higher incidences of the disease in 2007 us health officials admitted that the pneumococcal vaccine had created superbugs that caused severe ear infections in children similarly bad news emerged about the hepatitis vaccine that same year when immunologists discovered mutated vaccineresistant viruses were causing disease 16 and in developing countries even to this day health officials are concerned that polio viruses in the vaccine may not only be mutating but may be causing the very disease they are supposed to prevent 17 live virus vaccines combine to create completely new virus a number of studies have been released in the past few months indicating that vaccine viruses can lead to dangerous mutations for example a veterinary vaccine study 18 at the university of melbourne australia found that using two different vaccine viruses to combat the same disease in an animal population quite rapidly caused the viruses to combine referred to as recombination creating brand new and more virulent viruses according to science daily 19 the vaccines were used to control infectious laryngotracheitis ilt an acute respiratory disease occurring in chickens worldwide the research found that when two different ilt vaccine strains were used in the same populations they combined into two new strains resulting in disease outbreaks previously scientists believed this occurrence would be highly unlikely but this research reveals a different truth the implications of this finding could extend to other live attenuated vaccines including those for humans according to the authors recombination between herpesviruses has been seen in vitro and in vivo under experimental conditions this has raised safety concerns about using attenuated herpesvirus vaccines in human and veterinary medicine and adds to other known concerns associated with their use including reversion to virulence and disease arising from recurrent reactivation of lifelong chronic infection we show that independent recombination events between distinct attenuated vaccine strains resulted in virulent recombinant viruses that became the dominant strains responsible for widespread disease these findings highlight the risks of using multiple different attenuated herpesvirus vaccines or vectors in the same populations as reported by science daily 20 comparisons of the vaccine strains and the new recombinant strains have shown that both the recombinant strains cause more severe disease or replicate to a higher level than the parent vaccine strains that gave rise to them dr lee said professor glenn browning said recombination was a natural process that can occur when two viruses infect the same cell at the same time while recombination has been recognized as a potential risk associated with live virus vaccines for many years the likelihood of it happening in viruses like this in the field has been thought to be so low that it was considered to be very unlikely to lead to significant problems he said our studies have shown that the risk of recombination between different vaccine strains in the field is significant as two different recombinant viruses arose within a year we also demonstrated that the consequences of such recombination can be very severe as the new viruses have been responsible for the deaths of thousands of australian poultry emphasis mine get informed before you vaccinate stories such as these underscore the importance to take control of your own health and that of your children its simply not wise to blindly depend on the information coming from the vaccine makers pr departments or from federal health officials and agencies that are mired in conflicts of interest with industry no matter what vaccination choices you make for yourself or your family there is a basic human right to be fully informed about all risks of medical interventions and pharmaceutical products like vaccines and have the freedom to refuse if you conclude the benefits do not outweigh the risks for you or your child unfortunately the business partnership between government health agencies and vaccine manufacturers is too close and is getting out of hand there is a lot of discrimination against americans who want to be free to exercise their human right to informed consent when it comes to making voluntary decisions about which vaccines they and their children use we can not allow that to continue its vitally important to know and exercise your legal rights and to understand your options when it comes to using vaccines and prescription drugs for example your doctor is legally obligated to provide you with the cdc vaccine information statement vis sheet and discuss the potential symptoms of side effects of the vaccinations you or your child receive before vaccination takes place if someone giving a vaccine does not do this it is a violation of federal law furthermore the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 also requires doctors and other vaccine providers to keep a permanent record of all vaccines given and the manufacturers name and lot number write down serious health problems hospitalizations injuries and deaths that occur after vaccination in the patients permanent medical record file an official report of all serious health problems hospitalizations injuries and deaths following vaccination to the federal vaccine adverse events reporting system vaers if a vaccine provider fails to inform record or report it is a violation of federal law its important to get all the facts before making your decision about vaccination and to understand that you have the legal right to opt out of using a vaccine that you do not want you or your child to receive at present all 50 states allow a medical exemption to vaccination medical exemptions must be approved by an md or do 48 states allow a religious exemption to vaccination and 18 states allow a personal philosophical or conscientious belief exemption to vaccination however vaccine exemptions are under attack in a number of states and its in everyones best interest to protect the right to make informed voluntary

warnings about the dangers of sun exposure the news reports have it all wronginstead of too much sun its likely most people are not getting enough even though summer is a time when more people are outsideand theoretically exposed to more sun which is the ideal way to boost your vitamin d levelsthere are three good reasons why you still many not be getting enough three reasons why you may be vitamin d deficient its estimated that over 95 percent of us senior citizens may be deficient in vitamin d along with 85 percent of the american public researchers have noted that vitamin d deficiency is prevalent in adults of all ages who have increased skin pigmentation such as those whose ancestors are from africa the middle east or india or who always wear sun protection or limit their outdoor activities 1 the truth is that many are under the false impression that theyre getting enough vitamin d when their levels are seriously deficient three major reasons for this are 1 relying too much on vitamind fortified foods or poorquality supplements first of all it is my firm belief that we were not designed to swallow our daily dose of vitamin d we were designed to absorb it from the sun there are very few foods that actually have therapeutic levels of vitamin d naturally it is a great backup to have the ability to absorb it orally but it is my belief that oral vitamin d is significantly inferior to vitamin d derived from the sun having said that dairy processors producing pasteurized milk have been fortifying milk with vitamin d since 1933 today about 98 percent of the milk supply in the us is fortified with approximately 400 international units iu of vitamin d per quart while dairies used to fortify their milk with vitamin d2 most have now switched over to the far superior d3 because of this fortification many people believe that drinking milk is enough to support healthy vitamin d levels but it is very difficult to get enough vitamin d from food sources alone as i mentioned very few foods naturally contain vitamin d and those that do will not contain enough to optimize your levels even if you include fortified foods into the mix additionally its important to realize that not all food sources provide the same kind of vitamin d plant sources provide you with d2 the more beneficial d3 can only be had through animalbased sources such as salmon which has about 450 ius per serving while other animalbased foods do contain some naturally occurring vitamin d it is typically at very low levels one large egg yolk for instance contains just 41 ius of vitamin d so again consuming these foods is not likely to give you enough vitamin d as it appears as though most adults need at least 8000 ius of vitamin d a day in order to raise their serum levels to healthy levels 2 as for supplements while safe sun exposure or safe tanning bed use are the best ways to optimize vitamin d oral supplementation can be used however many are taking vitamin d2 the type used in many prescription vitamin d supplements unaware that this form is unlikely to give you the health benefits youre seeking vitamin d3 is approximately 87 percent more potent in raising and maintaining vitamin d concentrations and produces 2 to 3fold greater storage of vitamin d than does d2 3 regardless of which form you use your body must also convert it into a more active form and it is estimated that vitamin d3 is converted 500 percent faster than vitamin d2 vitamin d2 also has a shorter shelf life and its metabolites bind poorly with cellular receptor sites further hampering its effectiveness so if you decide to supplement with an oral form of vitamin d make sure its d3 not d2 2 you slather on sunscreen do you dutifully slather your body with sunscreen before heading outdoors and then assume your vitamin d levels are fine because you spend plenty of time in the sun this too is a risk factor for deficiency because sunscreens effectively block the type of ultraviolet light uvb needed in order for your body to produce vitamin d in response to the exposure according to vitamin d researcher michael holick 4 a sunscreen with a sun protection of 15 absorbs 99 of the incident uvb radiation and thus when topically applied properly will decrease the synthesis of vitamin d3 in the skin by 99 3 youre sunbathing in the wrong place while laying on a glass patio or soaking up rays through a window may feel good on your skin the warmth that comes through is deceiving because vitamin dproducing uvb rays can not pass through glass so youll get absolutely no boost to your vitamin d levels if the sunlight passes through a window before hitting your skin worse still the skindamaging uva light which penetrates your skin more deeply than uvb and may be a much more important factor in photoaging wrinkles and skin cancers does pass through glass this means that getting sun exposure through a window gives you none of the beneficial uvb and all of the cancercausing uva a study in medical hypotheses 5 even suggested that indoor workers may have increased rates of melanoma because theyre exposed to sunlight through windows and only uva light unlike uvb can pass through window glass at the same time these indoor workers are missing out on exposure to the beneficial uvb rays and have lower levels of vitamin d how to maximize your vitamin d from safe sun exposure occasional sunlight exposure to your face and hands is not sufficient for vitamin d nutrition for most people to optimize your levels you need to expose large portions of your skin to the sun and you may need to do it for more than a few minutes contrary to popular belief the best time to be in the sun for vitamin d production is actually as near to solar noon as possible you need to figure in daylight saving time which typically pushes solar noon to 1 pm for most this is because while uva rays are quite constant during all hours of daylight throughout the entire year uvb are low in morning and evening and high at midday so to use the sun to maximize your vitamin d production and minimize your risk of skin damage the middle of the day roughly between 1000 am and 200 pm is the best and safest time during this uvbintense period you will likely need the shortest sun exposure time to produce the most vitamin d as far as the optimal length of exposure you only need enough to have your skin turn the lightest shade of pink this may only be a few minutes for those who have very pale skin once you have reached this point your body will not make any additional vitamin d and any further exposure will only result in damage to your skin most people with fair skin will max out their vitamin d production in just 1020 minutes or again when their skin starts turning the lightest shade of pink some will need less others more the darker your skin the longer exposure you will need to optimize your vitamin d production the skin around your eyes and your face is typically much thinner than other areas on your body and is a relatively small surface area so will not contribute much to vitamin d production it is strongly recommended to protect this fragile area of your body as is at a much higher risk for cosmetic photo damage and premature wrinkling you can use a safe sun block in this area or wear a cap that always keeps your eyes in the shade which is what i do when i am outside seeking to increase my vitamin d levels from a health perspective it doesnt make much sense to expose your skin to the sun when it is lower than 50 degrees above the horizon because you will not receive any valuable uvb rays but you will expose yourself to the more dangerous and potentially deadly uva rays uvas have a longer wavelength than uvb and can more easily penetrate the ozone layer and other obstacles like clouds and pollution on their way from the sun to the earth so while it will give you a tan mainly by oxidizing melanin instead of producing new melanin unless the companion uvb rays are available youre likely doing more harm than good and should probably stay out of the sun to protect your skin during the times of the year when uvb rays are not present where you live you essentially have two options you can use a safe tanning bed or you can swallow oral vitamin d3 what are the optimal levels to aim for i would strongly encourage you to have your blood level checked to confirm that your sun exposure is putting you at the right level as there are many variables that can influence this including the darkness of your skin your age and your geographical location if it isnt or if sun exposure is not a practical option for you then you should consider supplementing with oral vitamin d3 remember unless you get a deep dark tan which is a pretty good indicator that your vitamin d levels are where they need to be it is wise to get your blood levels checked that is the only way to know for certain you have reached therapeutic levels please do take this information seriously and share it with your friends and family as correcting a vitamin d deficiency is simple and it may cut your risk of dying by more than half according to an analysis conducted last year 6 people with low levels of vitamin d were found to be more likely to have diabetes high blood pressure and diseased heart muscle and were three times more likely to die from any cause compared to those with normal levels vitamin d is also emerging as a key player in the fight against cancer so it is very much to your advantage to get your levels up where they need to be

that found in soy on a developing fetus according to medical news today 1 a paper published in biology of reproduction 2 suggests that exposure to estrogenic chemicals in the womb or during childhood has the potential to negatively affect a womans fertility as an adult this coincides with earlier research on neonatal effects of exposure to plant or environmental estrogens in studies with mice researchers found that causes of infertility included failure to ovulate reduced ability of the oviduct to support embryo development before ovulation and failure of the uterus to support effective implantation of blastocyststage embryos according to medical news today the team now reports that neonatal exposure to genistein changes the level of immune response in the mouse oviduct known as mucosal immune response some of the immune response genes were altered beginning from the time of genistein treatment while others were altered much later when the mouse was in early pregnancy together those changes led to harmfully altered immune responses and to compromised oviduct support for preimplantation embryo development both of which would likely contribute to infertility since human development of the reproductive tract continues through puberty researchers believe that estrogenic chemical exposure to human females as a fetus infant child and adolescent could have impacts on fertility the authors suggested that minimizing the use of soybased baby formula would be a step toward maintaining female reproductive health earlier research has also found that the compound genistein impairs sperm as they swim toward the egg even tiny doses of the compound in the female tract could destroy sperm which would impair your ability to conceive in the first place do you still believe soy is a health food soybeans contain compounds called phytoestrogens or isoflavones which have been found to produce a variety of mild hormonal actions within the human body by mimicking the sex hormone estrogen an increased risk of breast cancer is another potential hazard especially if youre exposed to high amounts of estrogenmimicking compounds from birth making matters worse unless youre buying usda 100 organic soy products chances are youre consuming genetically engineered ge soy or feeding it to your baby and ge cropssoy in particularhas also been linked to serious fertility problems glyphosate the active ingredient in roundup has similarly been implicated in causing miscarriages and both conventional and genetically engineered soy is typically treated with heavy doses of this herbicide all in all the health hazards of unfermented soy productsparticularly genetically engineered varietiesare so serious and numerous i strongly suggest avoiding them altogether whether youre planning a pregnancy or not but clearly its of particular concern for pregnant women for an excellent summary of the many dangers of consuming unfermented soy please see this previous article by the weston a price foundation unfortunately many americans who are committed to healthy lifestyles have been hoodwinked and manipulated into believing that unfermented and processed soy products like soy milk soy cheese soy burgers and soy ice cream are good for them this is a tragic case of shrewd marketing and outright lies with the end result of producing large profits for the soy industry and impaired health for most who have been deceived into using unfermented soy longterm why you should avoid feeding your baby soy infant formula nearly 20 percent of us infants are now fed soy formula but as demonstrated in the featured study the estrogens in soy can cause serious longterm harm to your babys sexual development and reproductive health its important to realize that feeding your baby soy formula is like giving her an estimated four to five birth control pills worth of estrogen every day infants fed soy formula have up to 20000 times the amount of estrogen in circulation as those fed other formulas a 1997 study in the lancet 3 found that infants who consume soy formulas were exposed to phytoestrogen levels that were 611 times higher on a body weight basis than in adults consuming soy foods and when you consider the fact that drinking two glasses of soy milk a day for one month provides enough of these compounds to alter your menstrual cycle im sure you can see what a massive problem soy formula can be male infants are also adversely affected by phytoestrogens male babies undergo a testosterone surge during the first few months of life when testosterone levels may be as high as those of an adult male during this period baby boys are programmed to express male characteristics after puberty not only in the development of their sexual organs and other masculinity traits but also in setting patterns in the brain characteristic of male behavior flooding his system with female hormones during this time can have severe ramifications on his development including potentially smaller testes and significantly reduced testosterone levels today about 15 percent of white girls and as much as 50 percent of africanamericans girls show signs of puberty such as breast development and pubic hair before the age of eight some girls are showing sexual development before the age of three such premature development of girls has been linked to the use of soy formula and exposure to other environmental estrogenmimickers such as pcbs and dde soy infant formula may reduce your babys iq aside from harmful endocrine disrupters soy infant formula can also contain over 1000 percent more aluminum than conventional milkbased formulas aluminum is a potent neurotoxin that has been implicated in the development of alzheimers disease and other brain disorders according to a study in pediatrics the official journal of the american academy of pediatrics 4 aluminum is now being implicated as interfering with a variety of cellular and metabolic processes in the nervous system and in other tissues but thats not all many soy foods also have toxic levels of manganese soy formula contains up to 80 times more manganese than is found in human breast milk and according to recent research high concentrations of manganese can lead to brain damage in infants and altered behaviors in adolescents 5 i rarely talk about absolutes but this is one instant where i will say i encourage you to never give your child soy formula i guess the only exception would be if there was a catastrophe and soy formula was the only food source temporarily available to keep your baby alive the benefits of breast feeding and healthier alternatives one of the best gifts you can give your child is to start out their life with a sound nutritional foundation and the best way from a health perspective to do this is by breastfeeding if you can in fact statistics show a clear correlation between feeding infants artificial formula and increased infant mortality within the first year its important to realize that there are at least 400 nutrients in breast milk that are not found in formula of course the healthier a moms diet is the healthier her breast milk will be too while any amount of breastfeeding is better than none at all it is clearly to your advantage and best for your babys health to breastfeed exclusively for at least the first 6 months then at the age of 6 or 9 months you can begin to supplement with solid foods while still continuing to breastfeed as well as you can see from the chart below breast milk and animal milk are far superior to commercially available infant formulas what exactly does your baby stand to gain by being breastfed lower risk of respiratory tract and middle ear infections lower risk of eczema lower risk of obesity added protection against heart disease diabetes asthma and allergies improved brain function and immune system function there are benefits to mom too the main ones are a reduced risk of chronic diseases like cancer a faster return to your prepregnancy weight and increased bonding between you and your baby there are circumstances and medical conditions that can prevent a woman from breastfeeding however the majority of women are able to breastfeed successfully if you need help contact a lactation consultant in your area for tips and support you can also visit la leche league which is a phenomenal resource for breastfeeding moms if for some reason youre not able to breastfeed or you have adopted a baby your next best option is to make a healthy infant formula using raw milk you can

            "text": "Monsanto's political influence clearly reaches far beyond our U.S. borders. Most recently, in an effort to \"end hunger in Africa,\" the Obama administration drafted some of the world's largest food and finance companies to invest in projects all over the continent5. Much of the $3 billion effort will go toward developing seeds and fertilizers and building silos for storage. To do this, the President has rounded up the usual suspects, which includes Monsanto. However, unlike the U.S., some donor countries are insisting that their money be spent on traditional food handouts instead of genetically engineered monoculture, such as that offered by Tanseed, a Tanzanian seed company that will spend $11 million buying certified seed to be sold in little packets to small farmers. Still, the evidence tells us genetically engineered crops cannot coexist with organic or conventional crops. They usually end up contaminating nearby fields, turning those farmers into patent-infringing criminals in the process?a scenario no farmer on any continent could ever have imagined a couple of decades ago. Another project seeking to establish genetically engineered crops in Africa is the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). Through this alliance, heavy-weights like Monsanto and other biotech companies, along with the Gates Foundation, are foolishly promoting GE crops as the answer to Africa's hunger problem. But donating patented seeds, which takes away the farmers' sovereignty, is not the way to save the third-world poor. The Gates Foundation has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to AGRA, and in 2006 Robert Horsch was hired for the project. Horsch was a Monsanto executive for 25 years. In a nutshell, the project may be sold under the banner of altruism and 'sustainability', but in reality it's anything but. It's just a multi-billion dollar enterprise to transform Africa into a GE-crop-friendly continent. In the end, such \"humanitarian\" efforts are doomed to fail while allowing Big Biotech to make obscene profits at the poor's expense. African farmer's will likely encounter the same problems as those in India, where farmers growing genetically engineered crops have been committing suicide due to financial hardships at a rate of one farmer taking his own life every 30 minutes...\n\nIn the U.S., labeling genetically engineered foods is likely the best shot we have at circumventing Monsanto's power-grabbing ways and stopping the unchecked proliferation of genetically engineered foods. This is why we strongly support state initiatives, such as California's 2012 ballot initiative to require genetically engineered foods sold in the state to be labeled. As consumers, we all have a right to know what's in our food. This is a powerful strategy that could have the impact of a national law. Because large food companies are unlikely to have dual labeling; one for California and another for the rest of the country. It would be very expensive, not to mention a logistical and PR nightmare. To avoid the dual labeling, many would likely opt to ditch genetically engineered ingredients from their products entirely. \n\n \n\n This is why supporting this initiative is so important, as victory in California will likely eliminate most genetically engineered foods from the rest of the U.S. as well. Powerful confirmation of this belief occurred earlier this year, when both Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo Inc. chose to alter one of their soda ingredients as a result of California's labeling requirements for carcinogens7. This is a PERFECT example of the national impact a California GE labeling requirement can, and no doubt WILL, have. While California is the only state requiring the label to state that the product contains the offending ingredient, these companies are switching their formula for the entire US market, rather than have two different labels: \"Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. are changing the way they make the caramel coloring used in their sodas as a result of a California law that mandates drinks containing a certain level of carcinogens bear a cancer warning label. The companies said the changes will be expanded nationally to streamline their manufacturing processes. They've already been made for drinks sold in California.\"\n\nAccording to a report in the journal Pediatrics9, which has been praised in major media like Discover Magazine10, the quadravalent vaccine for HPV, Gardasil, appears to be protecting young people that haven't even been vaccinated with it. Not only that, Gardasil has accomplished this amazing feat in just four years?long before most vaccines begin to show any sign of what's known as \"herd immunity.\" The study looked at rates of HPV infection in a small group of teens and young women at two primary care clinics, and found that infections from the cancer-causing HPV strain had declined. Apparently, they also observed that infections in women, who had not been vaccinated, had also declined. The team concluded the overall decline in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated must have been due to the vaccine! As per Discover Magazine, if the news pans out to be true in further research, it will be \"pretty exciting.\"  Indeed, if this is true it would be an outright miracle, considering the fact that this theory is beyond ludicrous. Consider that claim in light of these facts: In the study, 59 percent of participants at two primary care clinics received the HPV vaccine According to 2008 survey statistics, an estimated 25 percent of American adolescents 13 to 17 years old had received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine, and a mere 11 percent had received all 3 doses11 By 2010 the vaccine uptake estimates had nearly doubled, with 48 percent of girls between the ages of 13 and 17 having received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine12 It is typically taught that the vaccine acquired herd immunity threshold is anywhere between 80-95 percent of the population, depending on the disease. So, HOW could the HPV vaccine confer herd immunity when, on a nationwide basis,  less than half of teens and young women have received the vaccine (and the vast majority of those have only received one-third of the recommended number of doses)? Whenever an outbreak of disease occurs, government health officials are always quick to point the finger at those who are unvaccinated, stating that it's because of them that vaccine induced herd immunity was not achieved, thereby allowing the disease to flourish (although they rarely if ever offer an explanation for why so many vaccinated people get sick when they should theoretically be immune). For most diseases, vaccine-induced herd immunity cannot be achieved unless 80-95 percent of the population is vaccinated against the disease in question. So truly, for the HPV vaccine to suddenly confer herd immunity at less than 50 percent coverage would be nothing short of a miracle. This \"study\" is nothing but marketing masquerading as science. Discover magazine also didn't mention the fact that at least five individuals on the seven-member team making these over-the-top claims are paid speakers and consultants for Merck, or have received research funds from Merck to develop this vaccine?meaning this wasn't exactly an independent, outside group with no conflicting interests in the outcome. Please also note that the president of the Merck Vaccine Division, Julie Gerberding, is the former head of the CDC. Discover also didn't mention that the rates of the rates of sexual activity?the primary way HPV is spread?had also declined during the years of the study period, which could indicate that the reason HPV infection rates went down was not \"herd\" immunity acquired from the vaccine, but rather that fewer young people were having sex.\n\nThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases describes vaccine-induced herd immunity, also labeled \"community immunity\" by public health doctors as follows13: \"When a critical portion of a community is immunized against a contagious disease, most members of the community are protected against that disease because there is little opportunity for an outbreak. Even those who are not eligible for certain vaccines?such as infants, pregnant women, or immunocompromised individuals?get some protection because the spread of contagious disease is contained. This is known as \"community immunity.\" The problem is that there is in fact such a thing as natural herd immunity. But what they've done is they've taken this natural phenomenon and assumed that vaccines will work the same way. However, vaccines do not confer the same kind of immunity as experiencing the natural disease, and the science clearly shows that there's a big difference between naturally acquired herd immunity and vaccine-induced herd immunity. To learn more, I urge you to listen to the following video, in which Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), discusses the concept of herd immunity. \"The original concept of herd immunity is that when a population experiences the natural disease? natural immunity would be achieved ? a robust, qualitatively superior natural herd immunity within the population, which would then protect other people from getting the disease in other age groups. It's the way infectious diseases work? The vaccinologists have adopted this idea of vaccine induced herd immunity. The problem with it is that all vaccines only confer temporary protection? Pertussis vaccine is one the best examples? Pertussis vaccines have been used for about 50 to 60 years, and the organism has started to evolve to become vaccine resistant. I think this is not something that's really understood generally by the public: Vaccines do not confer the same type of immunity that natural exposure to the disease does.\" Vaccine professionals would like you to believe they are the same, but they're qualitatively two entirely different types of immune responses. \"In most cases natural exposure to disease would give you a longer lasting, more robust, qualitatively superior immunity because it gives you both cell mediated immunity and humoral immunity,\" Barbara explains. \"Humoral is the antibody production. The way you measure vaccine-induced immunity is by how high the antibody titers are. (How many antibodies you have, basically.) But the problem is, the cell mediated immunity is very important as well. Most vaccines evade cell mediated immunity and go straight for the antibodies, which is only one part of immunity. That's been the big problem with the production of vaccines.\" Vaccines are designed to trick your body's immune system into producing protective   antibodies needed to resist any future infection. However, your body is smarter than that. The artificial stimulation of your immune system produced by lab altered bacteria and viruses simply does not replicate the exact response that your immune system mounts when naturally encountering the infectious microorganism. \"The fact that manmade vaccines cannot replicate the body's natural experience with the disease is one of the key points of contention between those who insist that mankind cannot live without mass use of multiple vaccines and those who believe that mankind's biological integrity will be severely compromised by their continued use. ... [I]s it better to protect children against infectious disease early in life through temporary immunity from a vaccine, or are they better off contracting certain contagious infections in childhood and attaining permanent immunity? Do vaccine complications ultimately cause more chronic illness and death than infectious diseases do? These questions essentially pit trust in human intervention against trust in nature and the natural order, which existed long before vaccines were created by man.\"\n\nThe fact that many vaccines are ineffective is becoming increasingly apparent. Merck has recently been slapped with two separate class action lawsuits contending they lied about the effectiveness of the mumps vaccine in their combination MMR shot, and fabricated efficacy studies to maintain the illusion for the past two decades that the vaccine is highly protective. In Australia, dangerous new strains of whooping cough bacteria were reported in March 201214. The vaccine, researchers said, was responsible. The reason for this is because, while whooping cough is primarily attributed to Bordetella pertussis infection, it is also caused by another closely related pathogen called B. parapertussis, which the vaccine does NOT protect against. Two years earlier, scientists at Penn State had already reported that the pertussis vaccine significantly enhanced the colonization of B. parapertussis, thereby promoting vaccine-resistant whooping cough outbreaks15. According to the authors: \"... [V]accination led to a 40-fold enhancement of B. parapertussis colonization in the lungs of mice. Though the mechanism behind this increased colonization was not specifically elucidated, it is speculated to involve specific immune responses skewed or dampened by the acellular vaccine, including cytokine and antibody production during infection. Despite this vaccine being hugely effective against B. pertussis, which was once the primary childhood killer, these data suggest that the vaccine may be contributing to the observed rise in whooping cough incidence over the last decade by promoting B. parapertussis infection.\" [Emphasis mine] Despite this, a spokeswoman for the Australian Department of Health and Ageing stated that \"suboptimal vaccine coverage\" was among the possible reasons for why whooping cough had increased sevenfold in Australia since 2007... But if the vaccine doesn't work, and in fact promotes vaccine-resistant disease outbreaks, then why would increasing vaccine rates make a positive difference? This rationale is completely nonsensical as it stands to reason that increasing vaccine coverage would then actually lead to increasingly higher incidences of the disease... In 2007, US health officials admitted that the pneumococcal vaccine had created superbugs that caused severe ear infections in children. Similarly bad news emerged about the hepatitis vaccine that same year, when immunologists discovered mutated vaccine-resistant viruses were causing disease16. And in developing countries, even to this day, health officials are concerned that polio viruses in the vaccine may not only be mutating, but may be causing the very disease they are supposed to prevent17.\n\nStories such as these underscore the importance to take control of your own health, and that of your children. It's simply not wise to blindly depend on the information coming from the vaccine makers' PR departments, or from federal health officials and agencies that are mired in conflicts of interest with industry... No matter what vaccination choices you make for yourself or your family, there is a basic human right to be fully informed about all risks of medical interventions and pharmaceutical products, like vaccines, and have the freedom to refuse if you conclude the benefits do not outweigh the risks for you or your child. Unfortunately, the business partnership between government health agencies and vaccine manufacturers is too close and is getting out of hand. There is a lot of discrimination against Americans, who want to be free to exercise their human right to informed consent when it comes to making voluntary decisions about which vaccines they and their children use. We cannot allow that to continue. It's vitally important to know and exercise your legal rights and to understand your options when it comes to using vaccines and prescription drugs. For example, your doctor is legally obligated to provide you with the CDC Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) sheet and discuss the potential symptoms of side effects of the vaccination(s) you or your child receive BEFORE vaccination takes place. If someone giving a vaccine does not do this, it is a violation of federal law. Furthermore, the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 also requires doctors and other vaccine providers to: Keep a permanent record of all vaccines given and the manufacturer's name and lot number Write down serious health problems, hospitalizations, injuries and deaths that occur after vaccination in the patient's permanent medical record File an official report of all serious health problems, hospitalizations, injuries and deaths following vaccination to the federal Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) If a vaccine provider fails to inform, record or report, it is a violation of federal law. It's important to get all the facts before making your decision about vaccination; and to understand that you have the legal right to opt out of using a vaccine that you do not want you or your child to receive. At present, all 50 states allow a medical exemption to vaccination (medical exemptions must be approved by an M.D. or D.O.); 48 states allow a religious exemption to vaccination; and 18 states allow a personal, philosophical or conscientious belief exemption to vaccination. However, vaccine exemptions are under attack in a number of states, and it's in everyone's best interest to protect the right to make informed, voluntary vaccination decisions.\n\nWhile it seems \"old-fashioned,\" the only truly effective actions you can take to protect the right to informed consent to vaccination and expand your rights under the law to make voluntary vaccine choices, is to get personally involved with your state legislators and the leaders in your community. Mass vaccination policies are made at the federal level but vaccine laws are made at the state level, and it is at the state level where your action to protect your vaccine choice rights will have the greatest impact.

Researchers have noted that vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in adults of all ages who have increased skin pigmentation (such as those whose ancestors are from Africa, the Middle East, or India), or who always wear sun protection or limit their outdoor activities.1 The truth is that many are under the false impression that they?re getting enough vitamin D, when their levels are seriously deficient. Three major reasons for this are: 1.  Relying Too Much on Vitamin-D Fortified Foods or Poor-Quality Supplements First of all, it is my firm belief that we were not designed to swallow our daily dose of vitamin D we were designed to absorb it from the sun. There are very few foods that actually have therapeutic levels of vitamin D naturally. It is a great backup to have the ability to absorb it orally, but it is my belief that oral vitamin D is significantly inferior to vitamin D derived from the sun. Having said that, dairy processors producing pasteurized milk have been fortifying milk with vitamin D since 1933. Today, about 98 percent of the milk supply in the U.S. is fortified with approximately 400 International Units (IU) of vitamin D per quart. While dairies used to fortify their milk with vitamin D2, most have now switched over to the far superior D3. Because of this fortification, many people believe that drinking milk is enough to support healthy vitamin D levels, but it is very difficult to get enough vitamin D from food sources alone. As I mentioned, very few foods naturally contain vitamin D -- and those that do will not contain enough to optimize your levels, even if you include fortified foods into the mix. Additionally, it's important to realize that not all food sources provide the same kind of vitamin D. Plant sources provide you with D2. The more beneficial D3 can only be had through animal-based sources such as salmon, which has about 450 IUs per serving. While other animal-based foods do contain some naturally occurring vitamin D, it is typically at very low levels. One large egg yolk, for instance, contains just 41 IUs of vitamin D. So, again, consuming these foods is not likely to give you enough vitamin D, as it appears as though most adults need at least 8,000 IU's of vitamin D a day in order to raise their serum levels to healthy levels.2 As for supplements, while safe sun exposure or safe tanning bed use are the best ways to optimize vitamin D, oral supplementation can be used. However, many are taking vitamin D2 (the type used in many prescription vitamin D supplements), unaware that this form is unlikely to give you the health benefits you?re seeking. Vitamin D3 is approximately 87 percent more potent in raising and maintaining vitamin D concentrations and produces 2- to 3-fold greater storage of vitamin D than does D2.3 Regardless of which form you use, your body must also convert it into a more active form, and it is estimated that vitamin D3 is converted 500 percent faster than vitamin D2. Vitamin D2 also has a shorter shelf life, and its metabolites bind poorly with cellular receptor sites, further hampering its effectiveness. So if you decide to supplement with an oral form of vitamin D, make sure it?s D3, not D2. Do you dutifully slather your body with sunscreen before heading outdoors, and then assume your vitamin D levels are fine because you spend plenty of time in the sun? This, too, is a risk factor for deficiency, because sunscreens effectively block the type of ultraviolet light ? UVB -- needed in order for your body to produce vitamin D in response to the exposure. ? ? a sunscreen with a sun protection of 15 absorbs 99% of the incident UVB radiation, and, thus, when topically applied properly will decrease the synthesis of vitamin D3 in the skin by 99%.? While laying on a glass patio or soaking up rays through a window may feel good on your skin, the warmth that comes through is deceiving because vitamin D-producing UVB rays cannot pass through glass. So you?ll get absolutely no boost to your vitamin D levels if the sunlight passes through a window before hitting your skin. Worse still, the skin-damaging UVA light, which penetrates your skin more deeply than UVB, and may be a much more important factor in photoaging, wrinkles and skin cancers, does pass through glass. This means that getting sun exposure through a window gives you none of the beneficial UVB, and all of the cancer-causing UVA! A study in Medical Hypotheses5 even suggested that indoor workers may have increased rates of melanoma because they're exposed to sunlight through windows, and only UVA light, unlike UVB, can pass through window glass. At the same time, these indoor workers are missing out on exposure to the beneficial UVB rays, and have lower levels of vitamin D.\n\nOccasional sunlight exposure to your face and hands is not sufficient for vitamin D nutrition for most people. To optimize your levels, you need to expose large portions of your skin to the sun, and you may need to do it for more than a few minutes. Contrary to popular belief, the best time to be in the sun for vitamin D production is actually as near to solar noon as possible (you need to figure in Daylight Saving Time, which typically pushes solar noon to 1 p.m. for most). This is because while UVA rays are quite constant during ALL hours of daylight, throughout the entire year, UVB are low in morning and evening and high at midday. So to use the sun to maximize your vitamin D production and minimize your risk of skin damage, the middle of the day (roughly between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.) is the best and safest time. During this UVB-intense period you will likely need the shortest sun exposure time to produce the most vitamin D. As far as the optimal length of exposure, you only need enough to have your skin turn the lightest shade of pink. This may only be a few minutes for those who have very pale skin. Once you have reached this point your body will not make any additional vitamin D and any further exposure will only result in damage to your skin. Most people with fair skin will max out their vitamin D production in just 10-20 minutes, or, again, when their skin starts turning the lightest shade of pink. Some will need less, others more. The darker your skin, the longer exposure you will need to optimize your vitamin D production. The skin around your eyes and your face is typically much thinner than other areas on your body and is a relatively small surface area so will not contribute much to vitamin D production. It is strongly recommended to protect this fragile area of your body, as is at a much higher risk for cosmetic photo damage and premature wrinkling. You can use a safe sun block in this area or wear a cap that always keeps your eyes in the shade, which is what I do when I am outside seeking to increase my vitamin D levels. From a health perspective it doesn't make much sense to expose your skin to the sun when it is lower than 50 degrees above the horizon because you will not receive any valuable UVB rays, but you will expose yourself to the more dangerous and potentially deadly UVA rays. UVA's have a longer wavelength than UVB and can more easily penetrate the ozone layer and other obstacles (like clouds and pollution) on their way from the sun to the earth. So while it will give you a tan (mainly by oxidizing melanin instead of producing new melanin), unless the companion UVB rays are available you're likely doing more harm than good and should probably stay out of the sun to protect your skin. During the times of the year when UVB rays are not present where you live you essentially have two options: You can use a safe tanning bed or you can swallow oral vitamin D3.\n\nI would strongly encourage you to have your blood level checked to confirm that your sun exposure is putting you at the right level, as there are many variables that can influence this, including the darkness of your skin, your age and your geographical location. If it isn't, or if sun exposure is not a practical option for you, then you should consider supplementing with oral vitamin D3. Remember, unless you get a deep dark tan, which is a pretty good indicator that your vitamin D levels are where they need to be, it is wise to get your blood levels checked -- that is the only way to know for certain you have reached therapeutic levels. Please do take this information seriously, and share it with your friends and family, as correcting a vitamin D deficiency is simple, and it may cut your risk of dying by more than half, according to an analysis conducted last year.6 People with low levels of vitamin D were found to be more likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure, and diseased heart muscle -- and were three times more likely to die from any cause compared to those with normal levels. Vitamin D is also emerging as a key player in the fight against cancer, so it is very much to your advantage to get your levels up where they need to be.\n\nNearly 20 percent of U.S. infants are now fed soy formula, but as demonstrated in the featured study, the estrogens in soy can cause serious long-term harm to your baby's sexual development and reproductive health. It's important to realize that feeding your baby soy formula is like giving her an estimated four to five birth control pills' worth of estrogen every day. Infants fed soy formula have up to 20,000 times the amount of estrogen in circulation as those fed other formulas! A 1997 study in The Lancet3 found that infants who consume soy formulas were exposed to phytoestrogen levels that were 6-11 times higher, on a body weight basis, than in adults consuming soy foods. And when you consider the fact that drinking two glasses of soy milk a day for one month provides enough of these compounds to alter your menstrual cycle, I'm sure you can see what a massive problem soy formula can be. Male infants are also adversely affected by phytoestrogens. Male babies undergo a testosterone surge during the first few months of life, when testosterone levels may be as high as those of an adult male. During this period, baby boys are programmed to express male characteristics after puberty, not only in the development of their sexual organs and other masculinity traits, but also in setting patterns in the brain characteristic of male behavior. Flooding his system with female hormones during this time can have severe ramifications on his development, including potentially smaller testes and significantly reduced testosterone levels. Today, about 15 percent of white girls and as much as 50 percent of African-Americans girls show signs of puberty, such as breast development and pubic hair, before the age of eight. Some girls are showing sexual development before the age of three! Such premature development of girls has been linked to the use of soy formula and exposure to other environmental estrogen-mimickers such as PCBs and DDE.\n\nOne of the best gifts you can give your child is to start out their life with a sound nutritional foundation, and the best way from a health perspective to do this is by breastfeeding if you can. In fact, statistics show a clear correlation between feeding infants artificial formula and increased infant mortality within the first year. It's important to realize that there are at least 400 nutrients in breast milk that are NOT found in formula. Of course, the healthier a mom's diet is, the healthier her breast milk will be, too. While any amount of breastfeeding is better than none at all, it is clearly to your advantage, and best for your baby's health, to breastfeed exclusively for at least the first 6 months. Then, at the age of 6 or 9 months, you can begin to supplement with solid foods (while still continuing to breastfeed as well). As you can see from the chart below, breast milk, and animal milk are far superior to commercially available infant formulas. What exactly does your baby stand to gain by being breastfed? There are benefits to mom, too. The main ones are a reduced risk of chronic diseases like cancer, a faster return to your pre-pregnancy weight, and increased bonding between you and your baby. There are circumstances and medical conditions that can prevent a woman from breastfeeding, however the majority of women are able to breastfeed successfully. If you need help, contact a lactation consultant in your area for tips and support. You can also visit La Leche League, which is a phenomenal resource for breastfeeding moms. If for some reason you're not able to breastfeed, or you have adopted a baby, your next best option is to make a healthy infant formula using raw milk. You can find homemade formula recipes here.",

            "text": "(Reuters) – Genetically modified corn seeds are no longer protecting Brazilian farmers from voracious tropical bugs, increasing costs as producers turn to pesticides, a farm group said on Monday.\n\nProducers want four major manufacturers of so-called BT corn seeds to reimburse them for the cost of spraying up to three coats of pesticides this year, said Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja farm lobby in Mato Grosso state.\n\n“The caterpillars should die if they eat the corn, but since they didn’t die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reais ($54) per hectare … at a time that corn prices are terrible,” he said.\n\nLarge-scale farming in the bug-ridden tropics has always been a challenge, and now Brazil’s government is concerned that planting the same crops repeatedly with the same seed technologies has left the agricultural superpower vulnerable to pest outbreaks and dependent on toxic chemicals.\n\nExperts in the United States have also warned about corn production prospects because of a growing bug resistance to genetically modified corn. Researchers in Iowa found significant damage from rootworms in corn fields last year.\n\nIn Brazil, the main corn culprit is Spodoptera frugiperda, also known as the corn leafworm or southern grassworm.\n\nSeed companies say they warned Brazilian farmers to plant part of their corn fields with conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to GMO seeds.\n\nDow Agrosciences, a division of Dow Chemical Co, has programs in Brazil to help corn farmers develop “an integrated pest management system that includes, among other things, the cultivation of refuge areas,” it said in an email.\n\nAnother company, DuPont, said it had not received any formal notification from Aprosoja. The company’s Pioneer brand has been working with producers to extend the durability of its seed technology and improve efficiency since Spodoptera worms were found to have developed resistance to the Cry1F protein, it said in a statement.\n\nMonsanto Co also said in a statement that it has not been formally notified by the group. The other company, Syngenta AG, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTomczyk, who also spoke for Brazilian farmers during a dispute over seed royalty payments to Monsanto that ended last year, said Aprosoja encouraged the planting of refuge areas. But he said the seed companies have not given clear instructions.\n\n“There are barely any non-GMO seeds available … it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers,” he said. Aprosoja hopes to reach a negotiated agreement with the seed companies, but if all else fails farmers may sue to get reparations for pesticide costs, he added.\n\nBrazil is harvesting its second of two annual corn crops and expects to produce 78 million tonnes this crop year, slightly less than last season’s record. Domestic prices recently fell to their lowest in four years because of abundant supplies.",

            "text": "The Association of Soybean and Corn Producers of the Mato Grosso region (Aprosoja-MT) has complained that its members' genetically modified 'Bt corn' crops are no longer resistant to insect pests.\n\nThat's corn which has been genetically modified to produce an insecticidal toxin that repels or kills pests - principally Spodoptera frugiperda, also known as fall armyworm, corn leafworm or southern grassworm.\n\nThe Bt toxin is meant to provide protection to the crop without needing to be sprayed with insecticide. But reports from farmers allege that the Bt corn is actually less resistant to attack by Spodoptera caterpillars than non-GMO varieties.\n\nNow farmers have been forced to apply insecticides to their crops, racking up additional environmental and financial costs - after having already paid a premium price for the GM corn seeds.\n\nThe loss of resistance to Bt corn caterpillars was identified by Aprosoja-MT in March, when the first reports of emerged from Mato Grosso producers frightened by what they saw on the field.\n\nAprosoja-MT began to gather technical reports with data, photos and economic analysis of producers' financial losses, estimated at $54 per hectare in terms of extra insecticide and application costs.\n\nThe association is now calling on Monsanto, DuPont, Syngenta, and Dow companies to offer solutions as well as compensate the farmers for their losses.\n\n\"We want companies point to a rapid solution to the losses and also a way to compensate those who were harmed\", says the president of Aprosoja-MT, Ricardo Tomczyk. \"It is a typical case of product that promised an outcome that was never delivered - i.e., deceptive advertising\"\n\nThe association has given the seed companies ten days in which to offer solutions to the problems presented by the GM varieties, as well as a way to compensate the losses faced by farmers in Mato Grosso.\n\nBut Monsanto and other seed companies are unlikely to accommodate the farmers. According to Reuters, \"seed companies say they warned Brazilian farmers to plant part of their corn fields with conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to GMO seeds.\"\n\nHowever Tomczyk responded that the seed companies instructions on creating insect refugia of non-GMO corn were vague and hard to follow. And in any case, he added, \"There are barely any non-GMO seeds available ... it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers.\"\n\nAprosoja-MT is attempting to negotiate an agreement with the seed companies, but insists that farmers are ready to sue for their pesticide costs.\n\nNot for the first time\n\nEarlier this year, a similar problem arose in the US, when scientists confirmed that corn-destroying rootworms had evolved to be resistant to the GMO corn engineered to kill them.\n\nAnd according to the non-profit TestBioTech, the GMO maize 1507 -which may soon be approved for cultivation in the European Union - is one of those now failing in Brazil.\n\nThis maize variety, developed by US companies Pioneer/DuPont and Dow, combines a Bt insecticidal protein with tolerance to glufosinate herbicides.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Crop Protection, certain pests in Brazil are becoming resistant to this maize line only few years after market approval.\n\nFarias et al. (2014) found resistant populations of Spodoptera in the federal states Bahia and Rio Grande del Sul. According to the authors, development of resistance in fall armyworm was first noticed in 2012, the third year after the start of cultivation of maize 1507 in Brazil.\n\nThe industry response to such loss of efficacy is not to encourage biodiversity, but to further modify the organisms, according to TestBioTech:\n\n\"The case of Brazil is an example for an overall trend showing that nearly twenty years after the start of commercialization of Bt crops, there are problems in several countries growing this kind of genetically engineered crop.\n\n\"Industry tries to tackle this issue by commercialization of so called 'stacked traits' that produce several different Bt toxins. The best known example is Monsanto's SmartStax maize that produces six different Bt toxins.\"\n\nTestBioTech also argues that the European Food Standards Agency should re-consider its likely approval for maize 1507 given the fast developing resistance to it among pests, also citing \"fundamental data gaps in risk assessment.\"",

response to infection dr felix yarovinsky assistant professor of immunology and senior author of the study published online in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the protein interferongamma ifnγ keeps viruses from replicating and stimulates the immune system to produce other diseasefighting agents neutrophils the newly identified cellular source of the protein are the major component of the pus that forms around injured tissue the researchers also report that the neutrophils appear to produce ifnγ through a new cellular pathway independent of tolllike receptors tlrs the bodys early warning system for invasion by pathogens this finding indicates that mammals might possess a second earlyalert system – the sort of builtin redundancy engineers would envy said dr felix yarovinsky assistant professor of immunology and senior author of the study published online in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences in june we believe our mouse study provides strong evidence that neutrophils white blood cells created in the bone marrow produce significant amounts of ifnγ in response to disease dr yarovinsky said the finding of a new and essential cellular source for ifnγ challenges a longheld belief in the field and is significant because neutrophils are the most common kind of white blood cell two pathogens were used in this study the parasite toxoplasma gondii – which can cause brain damage in humans and other mammals that have compromised immune systems – and a type of bacterium that causes gastroenteritis salmonella typhimurium innate

have long been observed to congregate at the site of a new infection they were commonly thought to be first responders or foot soldiers rather than generals in the battle against disease as this study indicates they are dr yarovinsky explained about 20 years ago there were clinical reports in humans and animals suggesting that neutrophils might produce ifnγ but the idea was largely ignored by the scientific community until the last decade he said since then studies at ut southwestern and elsewhere have found that mice lacking nk and t cells and therefore expected to be unable to produce ifnγ somehow continued to withstand infections better than mice genetically unable to make any ifnγ these observations suggested the possibility of an unknown source of the protein he explained in a series of experiments the ut southwestern researchers identified neutrophils as the major source of ifnγ in mice lacking nk and t cells based on what we know about neutrophils their large numbers and rapid deployment to the site of infection should provide an important means of very early robust and rapid elimination of diseasecausing agents the researchers wrote although neutrophilderived ifnγ alone is insufficient to achieve complete host protection the protein significantly extended the survival of mice in this study dr yarovinsky said in related news the burroughs wellcome fund in june announced that dr yarovinsky had been selected for its 2013 investigators in the pathogenesis of infectious disease award to further investigate mechanisms of host defense against various infectious diseases

            "text": "DALLAS – July 10, 2013 – Researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center report the identification of a new cellular source for an important disease-fighting protein used in the body’s earliest response to infection.\n\nThe protein interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) keeps viruses from replicating and stimulates the immune system to produce other disease-fighting agents. Neutrophils, the newly identified cellular source of the protein, are the major component of the pus that forms around injured tissue.\n\nThe researchers also report that the neutrophils appear to produce IFN-γ through a new cellular pathway independent of Toll-like receptors (TLRs): the body’s early warning system for invasion by pathogens. This finding indicates that mammals might possess a second early-alert system – the sort of built-in redundancy engineers would envy, said Dr. Felix Yarovinsky, assistant professor of immunology and senior author of the study published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in June.\n\n“We believe our mouse study provides strong evidence that neutrophils, white blood cells created in the bone marrow, produce significant amounts of IFN-γ in response to disease,” Dr. Yarovinsky said. “The finding of a new and essential cellular source for IFN-γ challenges a long-held belief in the field and is significant because neutrophils are the most common kind of white blood cell.”\n\nTwo pathogens were used in this study: the parasite Toxoplasma gondii – which can cause brain damage in humans and other mammals that have compromised immune systems – and a type of bacterium that causes gastroenteritis, Salmonella typhimurium.\n\nInnate immunity is the body’s first line of defense against pathogens, including those that it has never before encountered. Adaptive immunity is the secondary system that battles pathogens to which the body has previously been exposed and to which it has developed antibodies.\n\nTextbooks list natural killer (NK) cells and T cells as the body’s significant sources of IFN-γ. Although large numbers of neutrophils have long been observed to congregate at the site of a new infection, they were commonly thought to be first responders or foot soldiers rather than generals in the battle against disease, as this study indicates they are, Dr. Yarovinsky explained.\n\nAbout 20 years ago, there were clinical reports in humans and animals suggesting that neutrophils might produce IFN-γ, but the idea was largely ignored by the scientific community until the last decade, he said.\n\nSince then, studies at UT Southwestern and elsewhere have found that mice lacking NK and T cells, and therefore expected to be unable to produce IFN-γ, somehow continued to withstand infections better than mice genetically unable to make any IFN-γ. These observations suggested the possibility of an unknown source of the protein, he explained.\n\nIn a series of experiments, the UT Southwestern researchers identified neutrophils as the major source of IFN-γ in mice lacking NK and T cells. “Based on what we know about neutrophils, their large numbers and rapid deployment to the site of infection should provide an important means of very early, robust, and rapid elimination of disease-causing agents,” the researchers wrote. Although neutrophil-derived IFN-γ alone is insufficient to achieve complete host protection, the protein significantly extended the survival of mice in this study, Dr. Yarovinsky said.\n\nIn related news, the Burroughs Wellcome Fund in June announced that Dr. Yarovinsky had been selected for its 2013 Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease Award to further investigate mechanisms of host defense against various infectious diseases mediated by IFN-γ produced by neutrophils. The award will provide $500,000 over five years to pursue this line of research.\n\nOthers involved include first author Carolyn Sturge, a graduate student of immunology; former research assistant Alicia Benson; research assistant II Megan Raetz; graduate student Cara L. Wilhelm; Dr. Julie Mirpuri, assistant professor of pediatrics; and Cancer Immunobiology Center Director Dr. Ellen Vitetta, professor of immunology and of microbiology.\n\nFunding was provided by the National Institutes of Health and the Burroughs Wellcome Foundation.\n\nUT Southwestern, one of the premier academic medical centers in the nation, integrates pioneering biomedical research with exceptional clinical care and education. The institution’s faculty includes many distinguished members, including five who have been awarded Nobel Prizes since 1985. Numbering more than 2,700, the faculty is responsible for groundbreaking medical advances and is committed to translating science-driven research quickly to new clinical treatments. UT Southwestern physicians provide medical care in 40 specialties to nearly 90,000 hospitalized patients and oversee more than 1.9 million outpatient visits a year.\n\nTo automatically receive news releases from UT Southwestern via email, subscribe at www.utsouthwestern.edu/receivenews",

            "body": "id rather listen to insects buzz here is what they should be doing americas self preservation plan 9112008 as our government meets with congress to debate and develops a financial rescue package for our economy let me make it quick and easy for them by giving them what i feel is the peoples plan americas self preservation plan this plan is so easy and i guarantee it will end our recession quickly boost the economy increase the world value of the us dollar significantly reduce global warming and the us carbon footprint eliminate our dependency on foreign fossil fuels create jobs reduce wars saving lives reduce hunger keep us wealth in america and make history and all of this by 9112011 you may be saying to yourself this is not possible no plan can ever achieve all of these great things it would be too good to be true and difficult to implement well you are all wrong this plan is so easy and simple it can be achieved by the american people making only one decision in their life without spending a dime with little effort in fact it will probably save you money for you believe me this plan is fool proof how can this be done well here is my simple plan in one sentence 1 park your gas vehicle and purchase a compressed air car within the next year or at least put one on order it will not cost you a dime more than your spending now it basically will be free read on this plan will make total sense soon i promises how can this be the whole plan simple these cars will be for sale in the us beginning in 2009 these cars will cost approximately 1600000 but as i said it will not cost you a dime more than youre paying not for transportation you will pay for this car over the next 3 years with the extra money you will save 200 to 400month by not fueling your gasoline powered vehicle compressed air cars can travel up to 90 mph and approximately 125 miles on a 200 tank of compressed air google search compressed air cars for more details on this technology but i am not here to promote any particular car manufacturer i am here to explain how my simple economic plan if fool proof if we all purchase again no real cost purchase these cars at the same time this out cry of the american people will force the government into providing tax credits incentives and low interest financing banks and car manufacturers will look at these loans as safe investment and will easily grant them to the consumers but in wont really matter to us because these cars are fairly inexpensive and will not cost you any more out of pocket money then you are currently sending fueling your gas vehicle in fact most people will save money and be driving a new environmentally friendly green vehicle for free with the extra money in our pocket the consumers can purchase a small compressed air refueling system for their home from their local compressed gaspropane distributor you can also just plug in your vehicle over night and it will recharge by it self gas stations may not cooperate with the transition of their tanks and pumps from gasoline to compressed air so the government may need to aid in pushing through simple regulation for compressed air home refueling systems along with financing and incentives for localized compressed air refueling stations to speed up the process thats it the americas self preservation plan how easy was that now youre asking yourself how will this no cost purchase of these cars by the american people achieve all of the great things i stated in my opening paragraph easy and here is how it wills all falls into place 1 the end of our recession and a boost for the economy most car driving american families i know are spending between 50 to 100 dollars a week in gas refueling minimum this equates to 200 to 400 dollars for gas minimum per month this money is substantial and in not going into the american economy most of the money is going overseas making a few people very wealthy these very wealthy people have too much money with little needs they do not live in the us and therefore they are not putting it back into the american economy if consumers instead of rich oil lords are saving this money and putting it into the american economy it will result in a proven continuous stimulus package consumers will spend the extra money on home purchases renovations electronics cars vacations air travel investments cure cancer heart disease etc most importantly the cost of oil per barrel will begin to plunge drastically to compensate for the surplus in world oil reducing gas prices at our pumps the reduction of gas prices will further help the economy and aid in the transition phase to total compressed air transportation other technologies such as generators and heating system boilers etc will emerge from the compressed air technology reducing oil dependencies further 2 increased value of the us dollar once the us starts climbing out of the recession and the price of oil per barrel starts to fall the value of the us dollar will increase basic economics quality of life will be better as us citizen can then return to traveling once more out side of the country 3 reduced global warming and us carbon footprint these cars have zero emissions the us consumes the majority of the world fossil fuels resulting in significant us pollution and emissions i understand that you need to consume fossil fuels to produce compressed air but this type of generation produces far less emissions and can be regulated easier power to manufacture compressed air can also be produced by alternate energies such as nuclear coal hydroelectric solar fuel cells cogeneration wind generation wave generation etc all american made self supported technologies lets not forget the reduction of oil spill risk and disasters which involve costly environmental clean up reduced off shore drilling and terrible affects oil spills have on habitats by the way does anyone really know what the effect of removing all of this oil from the ground is doing to our planet what about the energy saving resulting from not having to pump the oil from the fields transferring of oil to gas stations buy trucks and tankers etc 4 eliminate our dependency on foreign fossil fuels if the majority of us purchase compressed air cars this will force all us car manufacturers to get into this arena and other transportation vehicles such as trucks boats etc will soon follow eventually eliminating the need for foreign fossil fuel dependency 5 create jobs compressed air home or centralized refueling stations will need to be installed and built all us car manufacturers will need to get hire labor and get into production of compressed air vehicles very quickly why do you think americans buy foreign cars its because they get better gas mileage and the vehicles are more dependable well all compressed cars will get great mpgs and the us car manufacturers will be forced into producing a dependable engine and vehicle i was in the manufacturing field for many years and i know these cars can be produced within a short period to time 6 reduce wars and save lives if you think 9112001 and our current crisis in the middle east is not because of oil terrorism you have been living under a rock our young men are being killed and permanently damaged because we are dependant upon oil 7 reduce hunger corn field and oil fields used for energy can be farmed to produce more food for the hungry there are hundreds of thousands of acres of land not producing food why the government can offer more farmaid for this transition 8 keep us wealth in america yes we have witnessed history in the making twice in less then 10 years 9112001 and 2008 right now for those of you who are not aware of the situation us wealth is exiting our shores faster then it has ever done before in our history many wealthy people investors etc are leaving the country to protect their investments due to high taxes low dollar value etc this combined with the high foreign oil prices is resulting in our countries wealth exiting our boarders at a rate never seen before in history yes if you have not figured it out oil controls our economy and foreign oil lords are in the driving seat pretty frightening i hope i made all of you a believer in my plan its fool proof i am not a politician lobbyist writer i am not associated with compressed air car manufacturers i am in the technology field an engineer by profession i am married with a family an american concerned with all of the current issues which face us today in the us my father and grandfathers fought and died for this country my family has worked in the manufacturing and engineering industry and was part of the great industrial revolution which built this country and put us on top as a world power our generation is now in control of this country and it is our turn to make history with this simple plan i can say one thing for what its worth i guarantee this plan will work but it will take all of us to believe if we fight together the results will be real with little to no effort or financial burden to all of us americans if we do our part in purchasing these types of vehicles this year the rest will fall into place i guarantee it i said my plan will take approximately 3 year to be fully implemented although results will be seen almost immediately lets set a date to be oil independent it is appropriate to set it for 9112011 on the 10th anniversary of a historic tragedy this day will go down in history as oil independence day the day the american people fought back and achieved independent from foreign oil and tool back control of our country and economy we should do this for our childrens future and in honor and memory of all of the victims of oil related wars and terrorism thank you for your time americans self preservation plan god bless america end",

            "text": "Earlier this afternoon I received an e-mail from a very sincere local retiree here in Fairfax who boasts about how he “canvas[es] for Barack Obama.”  This gentleman is concerned that the public doesn’t know where Sen. Obama stands on economic issues.  So he asked me if I would help him organize a visit by Sen. Obama to GMU’s campus — a visit to give the Senator an opportunity to talk about the economy.\n\nThanks for your note asking if GMU Econ is interested in inviting Barack Obama to campus in order for him to outline his “economic plan.”\n\nI can’t go along with your suggestion.  First, and most practically, such an invitation would really have to come from either the Office of the Provost or the Office of the President — not from the Chairman of the Department of Economics.\n\nSecond, and most importantly, I have negative willingness to be part of an effort to give any politician a platform to speak about economics.  Very few of them have any knowledge of the subject, and even fewer of them are courageous enough to speak about it honestly.\n\nListening to politicians, regardless of party, discuss economics makes me sick both to my head and to my stomach.  And the only people who are not similarly affected, I fear, are persons whose knowledge of economics is sufficiently scant — or whose ethics are sufficiently perverted — to protect their senses from being insulted by what issues forth from the mouths of politicians speaking on economic topics.\n\nSo as an economist, I am no more interested in having Sen. Obama (or Sen. McCain) come to GMU’s campus to lecture us on “how to manage the economy” than I would be, say, to have O.J. Simpson come to GMU’s campus to lecture us on how to manage one’s marriage.",

            "text": "America is facing the toughest economic challenges in our nation's history. -- Now is the time to put America first and curtail our foreign aid.\n\n\n\nThe American people are the most charitable and generous on the face of the earth. Having said that, we must now as a nation concentrate on our own economic well being before we devote resources we can't afford to others.\n\n\n\nNow is the time for other nations to pick up the slack, step up to the plate and be as helpful as we have been. It is about time that the world's communities help more and look to the U.S. less. The United States has done more than its fair share for others since our birth as a nation.\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at the latest public records of the top 10 countries that receive U.S. foreign aid. Keeping in mind that these statistics do not even take into account the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq:\n\n\n\n1. Israel: $2.4 billion. Virtually all of this money is used to buy weapons (up to 75% made in the U.S.). Beginning in 2009, the U.S. plans to give $30 billion over 10 years.\n\n\n\n2. Egypt: $1.7 billion. $1.3 billion to buy weapons; $103 million for education; $74 million for health care; $45 million to promote civic participation and human rights.\n\n\n\n3. Pakistan: $798 million. $330 million for security efforts, including military-equipment upgrades and border security; $20 million for infrastructure.\n\n\n\n4. Jordan: $688 million. $326 million to fight terrorism and promote regional stability through equipment upgrades and training; $163 million cash payment to the Jordanian government.\n\n\n\n5. Kenya $586 million. $501 million to fight HIV/AIDS through drug treatment and abstinence education and to combat malaria; $15 million for agricultural development; $5.4 million for programs that promote government accountability.\n\n\n\n6. South Africa: $574 million. $557 million to fight TB and HIV/AIDS; $3 million for education.\n\n\n\n7. Mexico: $551 million.\n\n\n\n8. Colombia: $541 million.\n\n\n\n9. Nigeria: $491 million.\n\n\n\n10. Sudan: $479 million.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. gave an estimated $26 billion dollars of foreign aid to some 150 countries. According to the Associated Press, the Obama administration has requested $36.4 billion in foreign assistance in fiscal 2011.\n\n\n\nAt this critical time when we are concerned about our country's financial well being it is imperative that we curtail our charity to others.\n\n\n\nWith national unemployment hovering nationally at nearly 10%, home foreclosures at record levels, our national deficit soaring, a crisis looming for Social Security and Medicare, two wars, several of states teetering on the verge of bankruptcy -- just to name a few of our immediate challenges -- we must get our own house in order first and foremost.\n\n\n\nThe American people should demand that our government leaders put America first. We need to come together as a nation and vow to solve our own problems before we seek to solve the problems of others. We have a long and proud history of helping others and we should be proud of that. But, when times are tough in America, I do not see others rushing to our side. -- One reason is because many nations are in the same boat economically as we are.\n\n\n\nNow is a time for national sacrifice and responsibility. All Americans must be prepared to do their part to restore America to her greatness.\n\nLet's take a lesson, America, from the unrest we are witnessing throughout Europe. We cannot allow ourselves to blame others. Our problems in many cases are self-inflicted. There is no one to blame but us. So lets not cast blame lets seek solutions.\n\n\n\nOur current challenges pale in comparison to the monumental challenges faced by those who came before us. General George Washington did not give up when he was faced with great obstacles while fighting the Revolutionary War.\n\nConditions were horrendous and troop morale was low. He knew that the promise of freedom was worth the battle over tyranny. So against great odds he fought on and led his troops to victory and gave birth to the greatest nation in the history of the world. Our history is chock full of overcoming diversity at great odds.\n\n\n\nAmerica is at our best when we are challenged. We never give up and always manage to put our principles above ourselves. We have done it before and today, we must do it again. A strong and prosperous America is important to the stability and prosperity of the world.\n\n\n\nWe have an obligation as a world power, (that others look to for stability, security and assurance), to get healthy as soon as possible for our own well-being and others too.\n\n\n\nA weak economic, political, national security America means a more dangerous and less secure world.\n\n\n\nBradley A. Blakeman served as deputy assistant to President George W. Bush from 2001-04.

protecting brazilian farmers from voracious tropical bugs increasing costs as producers turn to pesticides a farm group said on monday producers want four major manufacturers of socalled bt corn seeds to reimburse them for the cost of spraying up to three coats of pesticides this year said ricardo tomczyk president of aprosoja farm lobby in mato grosso state the caterpillars should die if they eat the corn but since they didnt die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reais 54 per hectare at a time that corn prices are terrible he said largescale farming in the bugridden tropics has always been a challenge and now brazils government is concerned that planting the same crops repeatedly with the same seed technologies has left the agricultural superpower vulnerable to pest

the first to show how fire and drought could lead to significant forest dieback in the amazon said jennifer balch an assistant professor of geography at penn state university who coled the study its only in the past couple of decades that fire has even been recognized as a major disturbance in amazon forest balch said fire scientists are catching up with a phenomenon thats happening so quickly as a result of frontier expansion and land use changes large areas of tropical forest particularly in the southeastern amazon are being logged and cleared for crops such practices thin the forest canopy

and consequently all the water in this region its like killing the chicken that lays the golden egg silva said she spearheaded laws that created new protected areas against encroaching ranchers and soya producers clamped down on illegal logging and fined and prosecuted the landowners who conspired with corrupt government officials to build illegally in the amazon while confiscating their property however after years of decline recent figures based on brazilian government data gathered by satellite imagery show the countrys rate of deforestation has increased by 28 per cent between

            "text": "The major South American countries like Brazil and Argentina have taken their place among the largest producers of GMO crops in the world alongside the United States in recent years, even as most of the world continues to reject them.\n\nBut now, slowly but surely, more and more farmers are beginning to take issue with Monsanto and other GM crop companies over underwhelming results in the fields from their major products.\n\nIn Brazil, farmers are now demanding a refund from Monsanto for extra money they were forced to spend on additional pesticides due to the failure of their GM corn seeds to kill a persistent pest, the corn leafworm.\n\nThe seeds are also produced by leading GMO companies DuPont, Dow, and Sygenta, according to an article from RT.\n\nIn this particular case, farmers were forced to spend a considerable amount on the extra pesticides to control the pest outbreak.\n\n“The caterpillars should die if they eat the corn, but since they didn’t die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reais ($54) per hectare … at a time that corn prices are terrible,” Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja farm lobby in Mato Grosso state, said in a statement.\n\nFor some perspective on how exorbitant these costs can be, note that an acre equals 2.47 hectares of land. In America, the average farm size is 441 acres, but that number is typically much larger in Brazil, often in the 10,000 hectare range or above (smaller farms are also common).\n\nAccording to the article, Monsanto and the other seed companies are blaming the farmers for the Bt corn failures, saying they did not properly plant the GM seeds alongside conventional ones to prevent the bugs from mutating to avoid the pesticide in the corn.\n\nIn Brazil, GM seed problems have been widespread.\n\nIn 2012, five million Brazilian farmers sued Monsanto for claiming that it was collecting royalties on crops it “unfairly claims as its own” according to the RT article.\n\nThe farmers, who had said Monsanto owed them at least $2 billion U.S. dollars, won the ruling; a settlement was eventually reached between the two parties after Monsanto said it would appeal. More info on the agreement can be found in the RT article.\n\nIn this case, Tomczyk responded to the Monsanto allegations by saying that conventional seeds are simply not a viable option for the farmers any longer.\n\n“There are barely any non-GMO seeds available … it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers,” Tomczyk said.\n\nHe also said that the four main GMO companies did not provide adequate instructions, and said he hopes to reach a negotiated agreement with them for damages caused.\n\nBroken promises, crop failures, a lack of choice when it comes to buying natural, non-GMO seeds: these concerns from Brazilian farmers are eerily similar to those expressed by thousands of Filipino farmers who have also struggled with Monsanto seeds.\n\nTo see their side of the story watch the movie below, ‘Ten Years of Failure: Farmers Deceived by GM Corn.’",

            "text": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Genetically modified corn seeds are no longer protecting Brazilian farmers from voracious tropical bugs, increasing costs as producers turn to pesticides, a farm group said on Monday.\n\nProducers want 4 significant suppliers of so-called BT corn seeds to reimburse them for the expense of spraying up to three coats of pesticides this year, said Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja farm lobby in Mato Grosso state.\n\n&quotThe caterpillars ought to die if they consume the corn, but due to the fact they didn't die this year producers had to invest on average 120 reais ($54) per hectare ... at a time that corn rates are terrible,&quot he stated.\n\nSignificant-scale farming in the bug-ridden tropics has generally been a challenge, and now Brazil's government is concerned that planting the exact same crops repeatedly with the very same seed technologies has left the agricultural superpower vulnerable to pest outbreaks and dependent on toxic chemical substances.\n\nProfessionals in the United States have also warned about corn production prospects due to the fact of a growing bug resistance to genetically modified corn. Researchers in Iowa found considerable damage from rootworms in corn fields final year.\n\nIn Brazil, the key corn culprit is Spodoptera frugiperda, also identified as the corn leafworm or southern grassworm.\n\nSeed firms say they warned Brazilian farmers to plant portion of their corn fields with conventional seeds to protect against bugs from mutating and establishing resistance to GMO seeds.\n\nDow Agrosciences, a division of Dow Chemical Corporation, has programs in Brazil to enable corn farmers develop &quotan integrated pest management system that consists of, among other factors, the cultivation of refuge regions,&quot it stated in an e-mail.\n\nA different firm, DuPont, stated it had not received any formal notification from Aprosoja. The company's Pioneer brand has been operating with producers to extend the durability of its seed technologies and enhance efficiency considering that Spodoptera worms were found to have created resistance to the Cry1F protein, it stated in a statement.\n\nThe other two companies, Monsanto Co and Syngenta AG did not promptly respond to request for comment.\n\nTomczyk, who also spoke for Brazilian farmers for the duration of a dispute over seed royalty payments to Monsanto that ended last year, stated Aprosoja encouraged the planting of refuge regions. But he said the seed businesses have not given clear instructions.\n\n&quotThere are barely any non-GMO seeds out there ... it is really uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers,&quot he said. Aprosoja hopes to attain a negotiated agreement with the seed businesses, but if all else fails farmers might sue to get reparations for pesticide costs, he added.\n\nBrazil is harvesting its second of two annual corn crops and expects to create 78 million tonnes this crop year, slightly much less than last season's record. Domestic costs lately hit their lowest in four years due to abundant supplies.",

What happens when you take a nearly 550-team event produced and directed by four solid event producers and then add seven more top-notch event producers and a hot, national, multi-brand powerhouse into the mix? A big announcement is what you get! It’s FINAL! It’s the Final Destination for The JAM Brands, who will be joining the mix with NLCC in the direction and production of the World’s largest multi-brand, all-level event. The partnership in Final Destination that was recently finalized puts the event producers from The JAM Brands and NLCC together on one team beginning in 2008-2009. Final Destination has been quite a success story from the start. It all began in 2006 when the NLCC made history by creating a true end-of-the-season culminating event. This event made history by bringing together multiple event producers offering one jointly run event for all levels of all-star cheer. The first year brought great success with an amazing 256 teams participating in the event in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2007, Final Destination returned to Baltimore and took off to new heights including a stellar turnout of 449 teams from 20 different states across the U.S. and Canada. Final Destination’s crazy growth pattern continued this season with an earth-shattering 541 teams battling it out in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The JAM Brands, headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, will bring even more national exposure to this already successful event including the addition of seven event producers which will be hosting qualifying events during the 2008-2009 season. Those event producers include JAMfest Cheer and Dance Events, COA Cheer and Dance, America’s Best Championships, Coastal Cheer and Dance Events, Great Lakes Championships, GSSA 1 Spirit Championship Series, Aloha International Spirit Championships and LIVE! Another subsidiary of The JAM Brands, Spirit Innovations, will serve as the “Official Uniform of Final Destination.” Aaron Flaker, President of The JAM Brands, says, “Final Destination is a perfect fit for The JAM Brands! We are an established group of quality brands getting involved in an established, quality event. Adding our JAM team alongside the companies of NLCC will prove to be an unbeatable combination. Hats off to NLCC and its members, who have been extremely innovative in their approach. The JAM Brands look forward to taking this huge success story to an even higher level. Final Destination is already the BIGGEST and we are going to continue to work hard as a team to continue to make it the BEST!” NLCC (an acronym for ‘Nation’s Leading Cheer Companies’) is based in Maryland and currently includes four event producers…Spirit Unlimited, AmeriCheer and AmeriDance, American Cheer and Dance Academy and Eastern Cheer and Dance Association. This group has been involved in the NLCC since its inception back in the 2005-2006 season and has been involved in the development and production of all three Final Destination events. The members of NLCC issued the following statement. “We are thrilled to welcome The JAM Brands to our Final Destination family, and we look forward to a long-standing relationship. It is extremely exciting to know that The JAM Brands share NLCC’s belief that ALL LEVELS of cheer and dance should receive the recognition they deserve for the hard work they put in all year. The JAM Brands and its partners also represent innovation and excitement within the spirit industry and their presence will elevate those same qualities that are already the hallmark of Final Destination. We realize that other multi-brand, all-level championships may surface, but we believe that with the addition of The JAM Brands, Final Destination will continue to be the largest of its kind in the world. The bottom line is that the BEST all-level event, just got BETTER!” “We are very excited to be able to offer a top-notch, year-ending, all-level championship,“ says Dan Kessler, Vice President of The JAM Brands. “This exciting move is just more proof of our continued pursuit to offer the best products and services to the cheer and dance industry. The history and success of Final Destination easily shows why we are so ecstatic about this phenomenal opportunity.

            "text": "Reuters reports that genetically modified (GMO) corn seeds are no longer keeping pests at bay for Brazilian farmers. The farmers are asking the four manufacturers of BT corn seeds to reimburse them for the amount they spent to spray pesticides this year. Pests are a constant problem in tropical countries, and manufacturers of GMO seeds tout them as being good for pest management since they have built in toxins designed to kill certain insects. \n\n \n\n The main corn pest in Brazil is Spodoptera frugiperda, a rootworm. \"The caterpillars should die if they eat the corn, but since they didn't die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reais ($54) per hectare ... at a time that corn prices are terrible,\" said Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja farm lobby in Mato Grosso state.\n\n \n\n Read more about GMO corn\n\n \n\n A study recently published describes how Bt maize 1507 isn’t protecting against pests in Brazil. Bt maize 1507 produces an insecticidal protein. The study mentions that researchers found resistant populations of Spodoptera frugiperda in the Brazilian states of Bahia and Rio Grande del Sul. The development of Spodoptera frugiperda was first noticed in Brazil, according to the study’s authors, in 2012, the third year after the beginning of Bt maize 1507 cultivation in the country.\n\n\n\n \n\n This is not the first time Bt maize 1507 hasn’t protected against Spodoptera frugiperda. Studies conducted in Puerto Rico in 2008 found similar pest resistance. Bt maize 1507 was withdrawn from the market in Puerto Rico. Despite problems with pest resistance, the GMO maize may soon be approved by the EU for cultivation. The European Food Safety Agency EFSA first issued a favorable opinion of cultivating the maize in 2005, but didn’t issue approval. However, Pioneer took the EU Commission to the European Court of Justice, which ruled in 2013 that the Commission must make a final decision soon.\n\nRead more about GMO labeling\n\n \n\n In the U.S. in the 1990s a new strain of the western corn rootworm was found in corn fields. After that came approval for GMO Bt seeds and farmers began planting them. Bt corn now accounts for about three-quarters of the U.S. corn crop. Now the same pest is making a comeback. In the spring, entomologists reported that four states in the Midwest and Northeast suspect western corn rootworm resistance. Resistance had been confirmed in three other states. Scientists in six other states have reported damage to corn hybrids containing the Bt toxin. As a result, farmers are spraying more insecticides to get rid of it. For a time pesticide use declined, but now that decline is being reversed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Image: Steve",

for his proposal icorps commercial potential for diagnostics and a vaccine targeting epidemic aeromonas hydrophila the nsf innovation corps program prepares scientists and engineers to extend their focus beyond the laboratory and broadens the impact of select nsffunded basicresearch projects liles icorps team proposal will investigate the further development of technology that allows the detection and control of the emerging bacterial pathogen aeromonas hydrophila in aquaculture farmed catfish specifically the technology looks at a hydrophila specific diagnostic assays that use growthbased antibodybased or dnabased methods as well as for a vaccine to prevent disease in catfish researchers used nextgeneration sequencing to identify unique genetic elements present in epidemic a hydrophila based on this knowledge they have developed growthbased antibodybased and genespecific diagnostic assays specific to epidemic a hydrophila and a vaccine strain that can be used for disease prevention catfish farming is an important aquaculture sector in the us beginning in 2009 epidemic outbreaks of disease due to aeromonas hydrophila emerged in catfish ponds causing the annual loss of millions of pounds of catfish these losses have threatened economic sustainability in the catfish industry and related sectors such as the animal feed industry and restaurants among others since there are few currently available diagnostic or control products targeting the epidemic a hydrophila the team hypothesizes that these technologies will have a significant impact in the community the technologies have the ability to reduce losses due to a hydrophila that are anticipated to continue to be in excess of threemillion pounds of foodsize catfish per year by helping to improve biosecurity the diagnostic assays can be an important tool in preventing the spread of the disease to other regions in the us such as mississippi louisiana and arkansas watch cosam faculty and

Researchers in Iowa found significant damage from rootworms in corn fields last year.\n\nIn Brazil, the main corn culprit is Spodoptera frugiperda, also known as the corn leafworm or southern grassworm.\n\nSeed companies say they warned Brazilian farmers to plant part of their corn fields with conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to GMO seeds.\n\nDow Agrosciences, a division of Dow Chemical Co, has programs in Brazil to help corn farmers develop \"an integrated pest management system that includes, among other things, the cultivation of refuge areas,\" it said in an email.\n\nAnother company, DuPont, said it had not received any formal notification from Aprosoja. The company's Pioneer brand has been working with producers to extend the durability of its seed technology and improve efficiency since Spodoptera worms were found to have developed resistance to the Cry1F protein, it said in a statement.\n\nMonsanto Co also said in a statement that it has not been formally notified by the group. The other company, Syngenta AG, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTomczyk, who also spoke for Brazilian farmers during a dispute over seed royalty payments to Monsanto that ended last year, said Aprosoja encouraged the planting of refuge areas. But he said the seed companies have not given clear instructions.\n\n\"There are barely any non-GMO seeds available ... it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers,\" he said. Aprosoja hopes to reach a negotiated agreement with the seed companies, but if all else fails farmers may sue to get reparations for pesticide costs, he added.\n\nBrazil is harvesting its second of two annual corn crops and expects to produce 78 million tonnes this crop year, slightly less than last season's record. Domestic prices recently fell to their lowest in four years because of abundant supplies.",

            "text": "Pests in Brazil are becoming resistant to Bt maize 1507 only three years after market approval, shows an industry-sponsored study\n\nThe study referred to in the article below, Field-evolved resistance to Cry1F maize by Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Brazil, is here:\n\n http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026121941400204X\n\n \n\n A graphic map of pest resistance is here:\n\n http://www.testbiotech.org/sites/default/files/bt_resistance_2014_0.jpg\n\nTestbiotech, 23 July 2014\n\nhttp://testbiotech.de/en/node/1076\n\n \n\n Genetically engineered maize 1507 may soon be approved for cultivation in the European Union. This maize event was developed by US companies Pioneer/DuPont and Dow. Maize 1507 is a so-called Bt crop that produces an insecticidal protein. The plants are also tolerant to herbicides with the active ingredient glufosinate.\n\n \n\n According to a study published in the journal Crop Protection, it has now been shown for the first time that certain pests in Brazil are becoming resistant to this maize line only few years after market approval. Farias et al. (2014) found resistant populations of fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), in the federal states Bahia and Rio Grande del Sul. Fall armyworm is the most important maize pest in Brazil. The publication was supported by Dow.\n\n \n\n According to the authors, development of resistance in fall armyworm was first noticed in 2012, the third year after the start of cultivation of maize 1507 in Brazil.\n\n \n\n From a scientific point of view, resistance in Spodoptera frugiperda doesn't come as a surprise. Studies conducted in Puerto Rico had already shown in 2008 that this pest insect had acquired resistance after few years of cultivation. As a consequence of these findings, industry withdrew maize 1507 from the market in Puerto Rico.\n\n \n\n The case of Brazil is an example for an overall trend showing that nearly twenty years after the start of commercialisation of Bt crops, there are problems in several countries growing this kind of genetically engineered crop (see figure \"Bt crops: Resistance development in pest insects\", http://www.testbiotech.org/en/node/1077). Industry tries to tackle this issue by commercialisation of so called \"stacked events\" that produce several different Bt toxins. The best known example is Monsanto's SmartStax maize that produces six different Bt toxins.\n\n \n\n The European Food Safety Agency EFSA first issued a favourable opinion regarding cultivation of maize 1507 in 2005. Because the EU Commission failed to approve maize 1507, Pioneer brought the Commission before the European Court of Justice. The court ruled in 2013 that the Commission must come to a final decision on cultivation soon.\n\n \n\n Testbiotech is demanding a stop of the approval process for maize 1507, especially because there are fundamental data gaps in risk assessment.",

reeks mythes en clich�s over isra�l in 1 artikel wist te bundelen volgens ludemann geeft de vs al ruim drie decennia onvoorwaardelijke steun aan isra�l waarna ze nog verwijst naar de zeer gevoelig liggende politieke immuniteit van de joodse staat uiteraard heeft de vs geregeld kritiek geuit en druk uitgeoefend op haar bondgenoot en was ze ook niet benauwd om sancties te treffen zo gebruikte de vs haar vetorecht niet toen de veiligheidsraad in 1980 in felle bewoordingen de annexatie van oostjeruzalem door isra�l veroordeelde en lidstaten opriep hun ambassades naar tel aviv te verplaatsen resolutie 478 ondanks druk van het amerikaanse congres hebben opeenvolgende regeringen geweigerd de amerikaanse ambassade naar jeruzalem te verplaatsen in 1997 bevroor de vs een deel van haar financi�le hulp aan isra�l toen deze afspraken niet nakwam over het doorsluizen van geld naar jordani� en in 2002 weigerde de vs reserveonderdelen te leveren van aan isra�l verkocht wapentuig uit protest tegen isra�ls herbezetting van de westoever in reactie op een bloedige reeks zelfmoordaanslagen in isra�l daarnaast heeft de vs door de jaren heen veelvuldig kritiek en druk op isra�l uitgeoefend betreffende het nederzettingenbeleid en vredesonderhandelingen met egypte en de palestijnen ook de ontruiming van de gazastrook en de deelname van hamas aan de palestijnse verkiezingen waren mede het gevolg van amerikaanse druk uit de vs klinken weliswaar veelvuldig warme woorden voor de joodse staat en het is de grootste hulpontvanger maar veel andere strategisch of economisch belangrijke staten zoals china en de bondgenoten in de golf hoeven evenmin te vrezen voor zware kritiek of politieke druk al is op hen veel en veel meer aan te merken op het gebied van mensenrechten eva ludemann omschrijft isra�l als een verwend kind dat altijd zijn zin doordrijft en overal mee wegkomt deze denigrerende opmerking is volkomen ongepast voor een serieus nieuwsartikel om karikaturen te schetsen zijn cartoonisten en columnisten ingehuurd bij isra�l gaan journalisten wat dit betreft echter steeds vaker over de schreef en veel zogenaamde nieuwsberichten over isra�l zijn in feite opiniestukken waarin isra�l van allerlei wordt beschuldigd en als het enige obstakel voor vrede wordt neergezet vreemd dat dan nog wordt beweerd dat isra�l boven kritiek verheven is wat betreft bovenstaande opmerking ieder land komt voor zijn belangen op dus ook isra�l maar terwijl isra�l continu wordt bekritiseerd vanwege re�le en vermeende wandaden komen juist andere landen met veel grovere mensenrechtenschendingen weg sri lanka heeft met de tamil tijgers gedaan wat isra�l vanwege de internationale publieke opinie en het vergrootglas dat constant op haar is gericht niet met hamas heeft kunnen doen waarna diezelfde internationale gemeenschap roept dat hamas niet militair te verslaan is en isra�l en het westen er daarom mee moeten gaan onderhandelen dit heet ook wel een self fulfilling prophecy daarbij heeft sri lanka vele burgerslachtoffers gemaakt maar de reportages uit het ziekenhuis van kilinochchi bleven uit we kregen geen bloederige lijken te zien en sympathisanten van de tamil tijgers kwamen niet op tv uitleggen wat voor misdaden tegen de menselijkheid het srilankese leger had begaan de vs heeft in afghanistan onlangs honderden burgerslachtoffers gemaakt bij

zo af en toe eens een artikel lezen ons hoofd schudden en over gaan tot de orde van de dag ludemann weet verder te melden het tweede instrument dat obama tot zijn beschikking heeft om isra�l zijn wil op te leggen is het opschorten van de uitzonderlijk grote amerikaanse financi�le hulp aan het land onder de vorige president george w bush is vastgelegd dat isra�l � volgens onderzoeken een van de veertig rijkste landen ter wereld � de komende tien jaar ruim dertig miljard dollar krijgt dat is in totaal ongeveer eenderde van het amerikaanse budget voor ontwikkelingshulp het amerikaanse budget voor buitenlandse hulp bedroeg zon 26 miljard dollar in 2008 waarvan isra�l circa 10 ontving nl 24 miljard egypte kwam op de tweede plaats met 17 miljard en jordani� op de vierde plaats met 688 miljoen dollar de twee buurlanden samen kregen dus bijna evenveel als isra�l en voor een groot deel gaat het om vredespremies financi�le steun die de landen ontvangen sinds het sluiten van een vredesverdrag als een dergelijk smeermiddel kan helpen bij het sluiten van vrede in zon hardnekkig conflictgebied is het dat geld wel waard lijkt ons en de vs ziet dit ook als in haar eigen belang overigens zijn de vs en de eu met honderden miljoenen dollars ook de hoofdsponsors van de palestijnse autoriteit en vluchtelingenorganisatie unrwa het is jammer dat de palestijnse autoriteit voor haar miljarden aan hulpgeld niet wat harder wordt afgerekend op haar vredesinspanningen de amerikaanse steun aan isra�l vertoonde onder bush een netto dalende lijn waarbij de economische steun jaarlijks werd afgebouwd en de militaire steun langzaam steeg ook andere arabische staten zoals saoediarabi� en andere golfstaten ontvangen militaire steun van de vs isra�l ligt zeer ge�soleerd in de regio en wordt door de arabische staten niet alleen niet erkend maar op vele terreinen tegengewerkt en vijandig bejegend dat gaat van antisemitische propaganda en haatzaaierij tot een sinds 1948 bestaande collectieve boycot een verbod voor joden of isra�lis om verschillende arabische en islamitische landen te bezoeken een verbod op het verkopen van land of onroerend goed aan joden nb in de palestijnse autoriteit staat hierop de doodstraf en een collectieve campagne tegen isra�l in de verenigde naties de meeste derde wereld landen waarmee isra�l aanvankelijk goede relaties had hebben zich bij de arabische positie aangesloten en stemmen met hen mee in verschillende vn gremia dankzij deze acties was isra�l decennialang als enige land niet bij een regionaal blok aangesloten en daardoor uitgesloten van de meeste vn lichamen en overlegorganen zonder militaire voorsprong op de arabische staten was isra�l er allang niet meer geweest in tegenstelling tot de arabische staten kan isra�l het zich niet permitteren om ook maar ��n oorlog te verliezen als de vs en rusland de arabische staten minder militaire steun zouden geven kon ook de steun aan isra�l omlaag en kon dat geld worden uitgegeven aan bijvoorbeeld ontziltingsinstallaties om zeewater drinkbaar te maken of zonnecollectoren in de woestijn of aan armoedebestrijding en beter onderwijs in de arabische staten het is echter de vraag of de zeer autocratische arabische regimes op dat soort projecten zitten te wachten zonder de arabische haatcampagne tegen isra�l had er al lang vrede kunnen zijn en was dus ook de amerikaans hulp aan isra�l onnodig overigens is die militaire steun niet altijd pers� in isra�ls belang veel geld dat isra�l van de vs ontvangt is het verplicht in de vs uit te geven waardoor de eigen wapenindustrie wordt geschaad en de afhankelijkheid vergroot wanneer isra�l moderne amerikaanse spullen koopt is isra�l vaak aan allerlei ongunstige verplichtingen gebonden zoals de vliegtuigen in de vs laten repareren de vs zorgen er bewust voor dat isra�l bepaalde codes of onderdelen mist zodat het van de vs afhankelijk blijft en die daarmee invloed kan uitoefenen op isra�ls beleid een recent voorbeeld hiervan is de f35 joint strike fighter de vs verbieden isra�l ook om eigen computersystemen in te bouwen zie ook f35 should israel develop an independent air superiority alternative eva ludemann bepleit een politieke isolatie van isra�l dit is volgens haar de enige weg naar vrede ze suggereert dat het enige probleem in het middenoosten de isra�lische bezetting is en dat als isra�l maar hard genoeg onder druk wordt gezet die onvoorwaardelijk op te geven er vanzelf vrede komt ze haalt daarbij de woorden van koning abdullah aan die een 57staten oplossing voorstelde waarin isra�l in ruil voor terugtrekking uit de westoever golan en oostjeruzalem diplomatieke banden met 57 arabische en islamitische staten zou krijgen klinkt mooi maar onlangs heeft de leider van de arabische liga in reactie op abdullah gezegd dat een dergelijk voorstel niet op tafel ligt het isra�lischarabische conflict werd niet veroorzaakt door de bezetting die een gevolg was van de zesdaagse oorlog maar door de weigering van de arabische wereld om ook maar enige vorm van joodse zelfbeschikking te erkennen vandaar de arabische afwijzing van het vn delingsplan uit 1947 een voor de arabieren nog veel gunstiger plan uit 1937 en de vredesvoorstellen van barak en clinton in 2000 er is vrede met egypte en jordani� en er is het arabische vredesplan maar ook daarin wordt niet van erkenning van isra�l als joodse staat gesproken en in egyptische staatsmedia wordt isra�l als illegale staat afgeschilderd en de joden het recht op een staat in welke grenzen dan ook ontkend ook egyptische politici intellectuelen en geestelijken spreken zich in dergelijke bewoordingen uit en de enkeling die daar tegenin durft te gaan komt in de problemen volgens het arabische vredesplan hebben de palestijnse vluchtelingen en hun miljoenen nakomelingen het recht op terugkeer naar isra�l wat niet te verenigen is met een tweestatenoplossing tot slot komt ludemann ook nog met het clich� van de machtige joodse lobby en waarom zou de president het risico lopen om nu al zijn populariteit te verspelen en tegelijkertijd ook nog eens de zeer invloedrijke joodse lobby tegen de haren instrijken in de vs zijn tal van invloedrijke lobbygroepen aktief waaronder ook het proarabische aramco vreemd dat we daar zo zelden over lezen overigens is aipac die onlangs ook voor een tweestatenoplossing pleitte wel over zijn bloeitijd heen en ondanks mooie woorden van steun van diverse presidenten en andere hooggeplaatsten op de jaarlijkse aipac conferentie is haar werkelijke macht beperkt zo belooft iedere aankomende president de amerikaanse ambassade naar jeruzalem te zullen verplaatsen maar hij staat nog steeds in tel aviv en zal daar vooralsnog ook blijven staan jonathan pollard in 1983 veroordeeld voor spionage voor isra�l zit nog steeds een levenslange gevangenisstraf uit ondanks herhaaldelijke campagnes voor zijn vrijlating andere mensen kregen voor spionage van vergelijkbare ernst veel kortere straffen met name het state department heeft altijd een afstandelijke en kritische houding gehad tegenover isra�l de zogenaamd oppermachtige proisra�l lobby ten spijt de door met name mearsheimer en walt populair gemaakte mythe van een machtige proisra�l lobby die de amerikaanse regering tegen het landsbelang in zou laten handelen is misleidend en ook een beetje onfris de joden zijn er immers veelvuldig van beschuldigd achter de schermen aan de touwtjes te trekken in de politiek media en financi�le wereld en zelfs uit te zijn op de wereldmacht rusland voor en na de revolutie naziduitsland

klopt wordt mi gelogenstraft met de informatie van vandaag de dag obama en zijn nieuwe beleid heeft veel losgemaakt ook over niet altijd gepubliceerde maar wel vermoedde zaken ik heb vandaag haaretz eens goed gelezen en daarin staan de nodige �aanwijzingen� over hoe politiek israel heel bewust bezig is �facts on the ground� te cre�ren met �goedkeuring� van de vs ik weet dat je het zeker niet leuk vindt maar ik citeer toch enkele dlen uit hharetz vandaag united states president barack obama lays out longterm visionary goals such as middle east peace�his statements are carefully tailored to the measure of congress support for israel � so obama stresses his support for israels security but is willing to confront prime minister benjamin netanyahu over the settlements� the us administration understands this demand as the total suspension of construction in the settlements and the evacuation of the illegal outposts netanyahu is willing to evacuate the outposts but insists on building to accommodate natural growth on the basis of the understandings reached with former president george w bush construction within builtup areas in settlements beyond the separation fence expanding settlement blocs inside the barrier beyond the builtup area and unlimited construction in jewish neighborhoods in east jerusalem�meanwhile tensions between washington and jerusalem are growing after the us administrations demand that israel completely freeze construction in all west bank settlements israeli political officials have accused the administration of taking a preferential line toward the palestinians with this regard some officials expressed disappointment after tuesdays round of meetings in london with george mitchell obamas envoy to the middle east were disappointed said one senior official all of the understandings reached during the george w bush administration are worth nothing �another official said the us administration is refusing every israeli attempt to reach new agreements on settlement construction the united states is taking a line of granting concessions to the palestinians that is not fair toward israel he said eva ludemann omschrijft isra�l als een verwend kind dat altijd zijn zin doordrijft en overal mee wegkomt�the israeli delegates were stunned by the uncompromising us stance and by statements from mitchell and his staff that agreements reached with the bush administration were unacceptable an israeli official privy to the talks said that the americans took something that had been agreed on for many years and just stopped everything �we evacuated 8000 settlers on our own initiative to which mitchell responded simply weve noted that here ook is het democratisch gehalte van israel vandaag duidelijk aan ernstige kritiek onderhevig de huidige ultrarechtse regering heeft blijkbaar een voedingsbodem in israel en dat noem ik een heel zorgelijke ontwikkeling yisrael beiteinus racist campaign against the countrys arab citizens has shifted from the election billboards to the knesset and cabinet room rightwing knesset members have drafted a series of laws to suppress the arab communitys freedom of expression and right to protest these bills put at the top of the agenda the need to halt racism ensure civil rights and advance equality as prescribed by the declaration of independence three legislative initiatives are on the docket one mandates a threeyear prison sentence for anyone who observes what the palestinians call the nakba the events of 1948 � the second dictates one year in prison for anyone who expresses in writing a statement that denies the existence of israel as a jewish and democratic state� finally there is a proposal to require anyone who receives israeli citizenship to sign a loyalty oath and perform military service or some form of public service the sanitized language in these bills can not conceal their true objective the institutionalization and deepening of discrimination against arab citizens they stain israeli democracy exacerbate the rifts in society and intensify the sense of ostracism and oppression of the arab community in its relations with the state deze zorgenbarende ontwikkeling is voor iedereen die een goed hart toedraagt aan het joodse volk in deze kleine wereld verdient om uitgedragen te worden opdat israel niet haar eigen graf graaft op monday 8 june 09

            "text": "Eva Ludemann berichtte deze week in Dagblad De Pers over het bezoek van premier Netanjahoe aan Barack Obama, waarbij ze een verbluffende reeks mythes en clich�s over Isra�l in 1 artikel wist te bundelen.\n\n\n\nVolgens Ludemann geeft de VS al \"ruim drie decennia onvoorwaardelijke steun aan Isra�l\", waarna ze nog verwijst naar de \"zeer gevoelig liggende, politieke immuniteit van de joodse staat\".\n\n\n\nUiteraard heeft de VS geregeld kritiek geuit en druk uitgeoefend op haar bondgenoot, en was ze ook niet benauwd om sancties te treffen. Zo gebruikte de VS haar vetorecht niet toen de Veiligheidsraad in 1980 in felle bewoordingen de annexatie van Oost-Jeruzalem door Isra�l veroordeelde en lidstaten opriep hun ambassades naar Tel Aviv te verplaatsen (resolutie 478). Ondanks druk van het Amerikaanse congres hebben opeenvolgende regeringen geweigerd de Amerikaanse ambassade naar Jeruzalem te verplaatsen. In 1997 bevroor de VS een deel van haar financi�le hulp aan Isra�l toen deze afspraken niet nakwam over het doorsluizen van geld naar Jordani�, en in 2002 weigerde de VS reserve-onderdelen te leveren van aan Isra�l verkocht wapentuig, uit protest tegen Isra�ls herbezetting van de Westoever in reactie op een bloedige reeks zelfmoordaanslagen in Isra�l. Daarnaast heeft de VS door de jaren heen veelvuldig kritiek en druk op Isra�l uitgeoefend betreffende het nederzettingenbeleid en vredesonderhandelingen met Egypte en de Palestijnen. Ook de ontruiming van de Gazastrook en de deelname van Hamas aan de Palestijnse verkiezingen waren mede het gevolg van Amerikaanse druk.\n\n \n\n\n\n Uit de VS klinken weliswaar veelvuldig warme woorden voor de Joodse staat, en het is de grootste hulpontvanger, maar veel andere strategisch of economisch belangrijke staten zoals China en de bondgenoten in de Golf hoeven evenmin te vrezen voor zware kritiek of politieke druk, al is op hen veel en veel meer aan te merken op het gebied van mensenrechten.\n\n\n\nEva Ludemann omschrijft Isra�l \"als een verwend kind dat altijd zijn zin doordrijft en overal mee wegkomt\".\n\n\n\nDeze denigrerende opmerking is volkomen ongepast voor een serieus nieuwsartikel. Om karikaturen te schetsen zijn cartoonisten en columnisten ingehuurd. Bij Isra�l gaan journalisten wat dit betreft echter steeds vaker over de schreef, en veel zogenaamde nieuwsberichten over Isra�l zijn in feite opiniestukken waarin Isra�l van allerlei wordt beschuldigd en als het enige obstakel voor vrede wordt neergezet. Vreemd dat dan nog wordt beweerd dat Isra�l boven kritiek verheven is...\n\n\n\nWat betreft bovenstaande opmerking: ieder land komt voor zijn belangen op, dus ook Isra�l. Maar terwijl Isra�l continu wordt bekritiseerd vanwege re�le en vermeende wandaden, komen juist andere landen met veel grovere mensenrechtenschendingen weg. Sri Lanka heeft met de Tamil Tijgers gedaan wat Isra�l - vanwege de internationale publieke opinie en het vergrootglas dat constant op haar is gericht - niet met Hamas heeft kunnen doen, waarna diezelfde internationale gemeenschap roept dat Hamas niet militair te verslaan is en Isra�l en het Westen er daarom mee moeten gaan onderhandelen. Dit heet ook wel een self fulfilling prophecy. Daarbij heeft Sri Lanka vele burgerslachtoffers gemaakt, maar de reportages uit het ziekenhuis van Kilinochchi bleven uit, we kregen geen bloederige lijken te zien en sympathisanten van de Tamil Tijgers kwamen niet op TV uitleggen wat voor misdaden tegen de menselijkheid het Srilankese leger had begaan. De VS heeft in Afghanistan onlangs honderden burgerslachtoffers gemaakt bij bombardementen. Het Pakistaanse leger heeft vele dorpen in het grensgebied met Afghanistan met de grond gelijk gemaakt omdat de Taliban zich er schuil houdt. Turkije heeft duizenden Koerdische dorpen verwoest in de jaren '80 en '90, en Rusland heeft enorm huisgehouden in Tsjetsjeni�. Om nog maar te zwijgen van Soedan, Kongo, Rwanda, Nigeria en vele, vele andere brandhaarden en schurkenregimes waarover we zo af en toe eens een artikel lezen, ons hoofd schudden en over gaan tot de orde van de dag.\n\n\n\nLudemann weet verder te melden: \"Het tweede instrument dat Obama tot zijn beschikking heeft om Isra�l zijn wil op te leggen, is het opschorten van de uitzonderlijk grote Amerikaanse financi�le hulp aan het land.\n\nOnder de vorige president George W. Bush is vastgelegd dat Isra�l � volgens onderzoeken een van de veertig rijkste landen ter wereld � de komende tien jaar ruim dertig miljard dollar krijgt. Dat is in totaal ongeveer eenderde van het Amerikaanse budget voor ontwikkelingshulp.\"\n\n\n\nHet Amerikaanse budget voor buitenlandse hulp bedroeg zo'n 26 miljard dollar in 2008, waarvan Isra�l circa 10% ontving, nl. 2,4 miljard. Egypte kwam op de tweede plaats met 1,7 miljard en Jordani� op de vierde plaats met 688 miljoen dollar. De twee buurlanden samen kregen dus bijna evenveel als Isra�l, en voor een groot deel gaat het om 'vredespremies', financi�le steun die de landen ontvangen sinds het sluiten van een vredesverdrag. Als een dergelijk smeermiddel kan helpen bij het sluiten van vrede in zo'n hardnekkig conflictgebied, is het dat geld wel waard lijkt ons, en de VS ziet dit ook als in haar eigen belang.\n\nOverigens zijn de VS en de EU met honderden miljoenen dollars ook de hoofdsponsors van de Palestijnse Autoriteit en vluchtelingenorganisatie UNRWA. Het is jammer dat de Palestijnse Autoriteit voor haar miljarden aan hulpgeld niet wat harder wordt afgerekend op haar vredesinspanningen.\n\n\n\nDe Amerikaanse steun aan Isra�l vertoonde onder Bush een netto dalende lijn, waarbij de economische steun jaarlijks werd afgebouwd en de militaire steun langzaam steeg. Ook andere Arabische staten, zoals Saoedi-Arabi� en andere golfstaten, ontvangen militaire steun van de VS.\n\n\n\nIsra�l ligt zeer ge�soleerd in de regio en wordt door de Arabische staten niet alleen niet erkend, maar op vele terreinen tegengewerkt en vijandig bejegend. Dat gaat van antisemitische propaganda en haatzaaierij tot een sinds 1948 bestaande collectieve boycot, een verbod voor Joden of Isra�li's om verschillende Arabische en islamitische landen te bezoeken, een verbod op het verkopen van land of onroerend goed aan Joden (NB: in de Palestijnse Autoriteit staat hierop de doodstraf), en een collectieve campagne tegen Isra�l in de Verenigde Naties. De meeste derde wereld landen, waarmee Isra�l aanvankelijk goede relaties had, hebben zich bij de Arabische positie aangesloten en stemmen met hen mee in verschillende VN gremia. Dankzij deze acties was Isra�l decennialang als enige land niet bij een regionaal blok aangesloten en daardoor uitgesloten van de meeste VN lichamen en overlegorganen.\n\n\n\nZonder militaire voorsprong op de Arabische staten was Isra�l er allang niet meer geweest. In tegenstelling tot de Arabische staten, kan Isra�l het zich niet permitteren om ook maar ��n oorlog te verliezen. Als de VS (en Rusland) de Arabische staten minder militaire steun zouden geven, kon ook de steun aan Isra�l omlaag, en kon dat geld worden uitgegeven aan bijvoorbeeld ontziltingsinstallaties om zeewater drinkbaar te maken, of zonnecollectoren in de woestijn, of aan armoedebestrijding en beter onderwijs in de Arabische staten. Het is echter de vraag of de zeer autocratische Arabische regimes op dat soort projecten zitten te wachten. Zonder de Arabische haatcampagne tegen Isra�l had er al lang vrede kunnen zijn en was dus ook de Amerikaans hulp aan Isra�l onnodig.\n\n\n\nOverigens is die militaire steun niet altijd pers� in Isra�ls belang. Veel geld dat Isra�l van de VS ontvangt is het verplicht in de VS uit te geven, waardoor de eigen wapenindustrie wordt geschaad en de afhankelijkheid vergroot. Wanneer Isra�l moderne Amerikaanse spullen koopt, is Isra�l vaak aan allerlei ongunstige verplichtingen gebonden, zoals de vliegtuigen in de VS laten repareren. De VS zorgen er bewust voor dat Isra�l bepaalde codes of onderdelen mist zodat het van de VS afhankelijk blijft, en die daarmee invloed kan uitoefenen op Isra�ls beleid. Een recent voorbeeld hiervan is de F35 (Joint Strike Fighter). De VS verbieden Isra�l ook om eigen computersystemen in te bouwen.\n\n(Zie ook: F-35: Should Israel develop an independent air superiority alternative?)\n\n\n\nEva Ludemann bepleit een politieke isolatie van Isra�l. Dit is volgens haar de enige weg naar vrede. Ze suggereert dat het enige probleem in het Midden-Oosten de Isra�lische bezetting is, en dat als Isra�l maar hard genoeg onder druk wordt gezet die onvoorwaardelijk op te geven, er vanzelf vrede komt. Ze haalt daarbij de woorden van koning Abdullah aan, die een 57-staten oplossing voorstelde, waarin Isra�l, in ruil voor terugtrekking uit de Westoever, Golan, en Oost-Jeruzalem, diplomatieke banden met 57 Arabische en islamitische staten zou krijgen. Klinkt mooi, maar onlangs heeft de leider van de Arabische Liga in reactie op Abdullah gezegd dat een dergelijk voorstel niet op tafel ligt.\n\n\n\nHet Isra�lisch-Arabische conflict werd niet veroorzaakt door de bezetting, die een gevolg was van de Zesdaagse Oorlog, maar door de weigering van de Arabische wereld om ook maar enige vorm van Joodse zelfbeschikking te erkennen. Vandaar de Arabische afwijzing van het VN delingsplan uit 1947, een voor de Arabieren nog veel gunstiger plan uit 1937, en de vredesvoorstellen van Barak en Clinton in 2000. Er is vrede met Egypte en Jordani�, en er is het Arabische vredesplan, maar ook daarin wordt niet van erkenning van Isra�l als Joodse staat gesproken, en in Egyptische staatsmedia wordt Isra�l als illegale staat afgeschilderd en de Joden het recht op een staat - in welke grenzen dan ook - ontkend. Ook Egyptische politici, intellectuelen en geestelijken spreken zich in dergelijke bewoordingen uit, en de enkeling die daar tegenin durft te gaan komt in de problemen. Volgens het Arabische vredesplan hebben de Palestijnse vluchtelingen en hun miljoenen nakomelingen het recht op terugkeer naar Isra�l, wat niet te verenigen is met een tweestatenoplossing.\n\n\n\nTot slot komt Ludemann ook nog met het clich� van de 'machtige Joodse lobby': \"En waarom zou de president het risico lopen om nu al zijn populariteit te verspelen en tegelijkertijd ook nog eens de zeer invloedrijke joodse lobby tegen de haren instrijken?\"\n\n\n\nIn de VS zijn tal van invloedrijke lobbygroepen aktief, waaronder ook het pro-Arabische Aramco. Vreemd dat we daar zo zelden over lezen. Overigens is AIPAC (die onlangs ook voor een tweestatenoplossing pleitte) wel over zijn bloeitijd heen, en ondanks mooie woorden van steun van diverse presidenten en andere hooggeplaatsten op de jaarlijkse AIPAC conferentie, is haar werkelijke macht beperkt. Zo belooft iedere aankomende president de Amerikaanse ambassade naar Jeruzalem te zullen verplaatsen, maar hij staat nog steeds in Tel Aviv, en zal daar vooralsnog ook blijven staan. Jonathan Pollard, in 1983 veroordeeld voor spionage voor Isra�l, zit nog steeds een levenslange gevangenisstraf uit ondanks herhaaldelijke campagnes voor zijn vrijlating. Andere mensen kregen voor spionage van vergelijkbare ernst veel kortere straffen. Met name het State Department heeft altijd een afstandelijke en kritische houding gehad tegenover Isra�l, de zogenaamd oppermachtige pro-Isra�l lobby ten spijt.\n\n\n\nDe door met name Mearsheimer en Walt populair gemaakte mythe van een machtige pro-Isra�l lobby die de Amerikaanse regering tegen het landsbelang in zou laten handelen, is misleidend en ook een beetje onfris. De Joden zijn er immers veelvuldig van beschuldigd achter de schermen aan de touwtjes te trekken in de politiek, media en financi�le wereld, en zelfs uit te zijn op de wereldmacht. Rusland (voor en na de revolutie), Nazi-Duitsland, en tegenwoordig de Arabische wereld verspreidden deze antisemitische leugens.\n\n\n\nZie hieronder voor enkele statistieken over hulp aan Isra�l en Arabische staten. \n\n\n\nRatna Pelle & Wouter Brass�\n\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n\n\nWho Gets U.S. Foreign Aid\n\nhttp://www.parade.com/news/intelligence-report/archive/who-gets-us-foreign-aid.html \n\n\n\nThe U.S. will give an estimated $26 billion in foreign aid in 2008�70% more than when President George W. Bush took office (the figure doesn�t include funds related to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan). More than 150 countries get financial assistance from the U.S. Here are the six that received the most this year.\n\n\n\nCOUNTRY: AID - PURPOSE\n\n1. Israel: $2.4 billion - Virtually all of this money is used to buy weapons (up to 75% made in the U.S.). Beginning in 2009, the U.S. plans to give $30 billion over 10 years.\n\n2. Egypt: $1.7 billion - $1.3 billion to buy weapons; $103 million for education; $74 million for health care; $45 million to promote civic participation and human rights.\n\n3. Pakistan: $798 million - $330 million for security efforts, including military-equipment upgrades and border security; $20 million for infrastructure.\n\n4. Jordan: $688 million - $326 million to fight terrorism and promote regional stability through equipment upgrades and training; $163 million cash payment to the Jordanian government.\n\n5. Kenya: $586 million - $501 million to fight HIV/AIDS through drug treatment and abstinence education and to combat malaria; $15 million for agricultural development; $5.4 million for programs that promote government accountability.\n\n6. South Africa: $574 million - $557 million to fight TB and HIV/AIDS; $3 million for education.\n\n7. Mexico: $551 million \n\n8. Colombia: $541 million \n\n9. Nigeria: $491 million \n\n10. Sudan: $479 million\n\n\n\n* Source: Estimates based on figures and documents from the U.S. Department of State. \n\nhttp://www.state.gov/f/releases/iab/fy2009cbj/ \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n Fris mijn geheugen even op, is Eva Ludemann niet die jourmaliste uit Gaza die getrouwd is met een Palestijn? Volgens Ludemann geeft de VS al \"ruim drie decennia onvoorwaardelijke steun aan Isra�l\", �\n\nUiteraard heeft de VS geregeld kritiek geuit en druk uitgeoefend op haar bondgenoot, en was ze ook niet benauwd om sancties te treffen. �Daarnaast heeft de VS door de jaren heen veelvuldig kritiek en druk op Isra�l uitgeoefend betreffende het nederzettingenbeleid en vredesonderhandelingen met Egypte en de Palestijnen. Ook de ontruiming van de Gazastrook en de deelname van Hamas aan de Palestijnse verkiezingen waren mede het gevolg van Amerikaanse druk.\n\n\n\nIk lees met interesse je artikels, die bijna uitsluitend een volledige steun beloven aan Israel en je verklaarde �oneerlijkheid� dat menig journalist of publiek figuur durft Israel te bekritiseren. Daarbij de indruk wekkend dat het bestaansrecht onmiddellijk in het geding is. En misschien is dat ook zo, maar dan is het de boodschapper niet verwijtbaar. \n\nEn misschien is dat wel verwijtbaar aan de politieke ontwikkelingen van Israel dat een werkelijke vrede tussen bezette Palestijnen en militair oppermachtig Israel in de weg staat, en dat terug te voeren is op haar beleid t.a.v. de veroverde gebieden in 1967.\n\nJe stelling dat de VS al \"ruim drie decennia onvoorwaardelijke steun aan Isra�l\", geeft, niet klopt, wordt m.i. gelogenstraft met de informatie van vandaag de dag. Obama en zijn nieuwe beleid heeft veel losgemaakt. Ook over niet altijd gepubliceerde maar wel vermoedde zaken.\n\nIk heb vandaag Haaretz eens goed gelezen. En daarin staan de nodige �aanwijzingen� over hoe politiek Israel heel bewust bezig is �facts on the ground� te cre�ren met �goedkeuring� van de VS. \n\nIk weet dat je het zeker niet leuk vindt maar ik citeer toch enkele dlen uit Hharetz vandaag:\n\n\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama lays out long-term visionary goals, such as Middle East peace�.His statements are carefully tailored to the measure of Congress' support for Israel. � So Obama stresses his support for Israel's security, but is willing to confront Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the settlements�.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe U.S. administration understands this demand as the total suspension of construction in the settlements and the evacuation of the illegal outposts. Netanyahu is willing to evacuate the outposts but insists on building to accommodate \"natural growth\" on the basis of the understandings reached with former president George W. Bush: construction within built-up areas in settlements beyond the separation fence, expanding settlement blocs inside the barrier beyond the built-up area and unlimited construction in Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem�.Meanwhile, tensions between Washington and Jerusalem are growing after the U.S. administration's demand that Israel completely freeze construction in all West Bank settlements. Israeli political officials have accused the administration of taking a preferential line toward the Palestinians with this regard. Some officials expressed disappointment after Tuesday's round of meetings in London with George Mitchell, Obama's envoy to the Middle East. \"We're disappointed,\" said one senior official. \"All of the understandings reached during the [George W.] Bush administration are worth nothing.\" �.Another official said the U.S. administration is refusing every Israeli attempt to reach new agreements on settlement construction. \"The United States is taking a line of granting concessions to the Palestinians that is not fair toward Israel,\" he said (Eva Ludemann omschrijft Isra�l \"als een verwend kind dat altijd zijn zin doordrijft en overal mee wegkomt\".)�.The Israeli delegates were stunned by the uncompromising U.S. stance, and by statements from Mitchell and his staff that agreements reached with the Bush administration were unacceptable. An Israeli official privy to the talks said that \"the Americans took something that had been agreed on for many years and just stopped everything.\" �\"We evacuated 8,000 settlers on our own initiative,\" to which Mitchell responded simply, \"We've noted that here.\" \n\nOok is het democratisch gehalte van Israel vandaag duidelijk aan ernstige kritiek onderhevig. De huidige ultrarechtse regering, heeft blijkbaar een voedingsbodem in Israel en dat noem ik een heel zorgelijke ontwikkeling: \n\nYisrael Beiteinu's racist campaign against the country's Arab citizens has shifted from the election billboards to the Knesset and cabinet room. Right-wing Knesset members have drafted a series of laws to suppress the Arab community's freedom of expression and right to protest. These bills put at the top of the agenda the need to halt racism, ensure civil rights and advance equality as prescribed by the Declaration of Independence. \n\nThree legislative initiatives are on the docket. One mandates a three-year prison sentence for anyone who observes what the Palestinians call the Nakba - the events of 1948. �. The second dictates one year in prison for anyone who expresses in writing \"a statement that denies the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state�. Finally, there is a proposal to require anyone who receives Israeli citizenship to sign a loyalty oath and perform military service, or some form of public service. ..The sanitized language in these bills cannot conceal their true objective: the institutionalization and deepening of discrimination against Arab citizens. They stain Israeli democracy, exacerbate the rifts in society and intensify the sense of ostracism and oppression of the Arab community in its relations with the state. \n\n\n\nDeze zorgenbarende ontwikkeling is voor iedereen die een goed hart toedraagt aan het Joodse volk in deze kleine wereld, verdient om uitgedragen te worden, opdat Israel niet haar eigen graf graaft. @Ben\n\nDe kritiek van Ratna en mij op Ludemann en vele anderen is niet dat ze Israel 'durven bekritiseren', maar vooral dat ze een karikatuur neerzetten van Israel en de zogenaamd onvoorwaardelijke steun ervoor (al dan niet vanwege een duistere lobby en/of Holocaustschuldgevoel). We geven duidelijke voorbeelden van foutieve en suggestieve beweringen van Ludemann, dus wat is nu je probleem?\n\nVrijwel geen zinnig mens is blij met het nederzettingenbeleid, met Yisrael Beitenu, met de winst van Wilders of Berlusconi bij de Europese verkiezingen, of van Hamas en Hezbollah. Je bent zo eenzijdig op Israel gefixeerd, dat ik niet snap waarom je nog geen eigen blog bent begonnen ipv. steeds hier te klagen dat Ratna het voor Israel opneemt? Schrijf je ook reacties op Stop de Bezetting en Meulenbelt, dat je bezorgd bent om de ultrarechtse Hamasregering en corruptie van Fatah en de decennialange kritiekloze steun uit de Arabische wereld, en waarom ze toch niet het terrorisme afzweren en de Joodse staat erkennen als ze echt vrede en een tweestatenoplossing willen? Waarom niet? Wouter,\n\nIk ben bang dat je mijn kritiek inhoudelijk niet goed gelezen hebt. Mijn kritiek is op delen van bovenstaand artikel. Ik corrigeer foutieve beweringen. Of kan je slecht tegen kritiek? Ben, wat een flauwe reactie. Waarom ga je niet op Wouters vragen in? Je corrigeert niks, maar herhaalt alleen je eeuwige kritiek dat ik te eenzijdig zou zijn. Uit jouw reacties blijkt telkens weer dat je alleen Israel verantwoordelijk houdt voor het conflict, en uit je alleen kritiek op Israel of op mensen die het voor Israel opnemen. Beetje vreemd dat je mij dan steeds weer van eenzijdigheid beticht. Ratna,\n\nEigenlijk is mijn repliek hier dezelfde als in je Obama stuk. '...if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will be blind to the truth'\n\n\n\nIk heb geen behoefte om te reageren op de aantijgingen van Wouter. \n\nIk erken best graag dat ik je bijdragen graag lees en dat ik jouw mening respecteer, maar niet deel. Je moet onderhand ook weten dat ik Israel zeker een plaats gun onder de zon. @Ben Flauw\n\nRatna en ik bekritiseerden een bijzonder tendentieus artikel van Eva Ludemann. Jij verwijt Ratna (en mij) dezelfde 'onvoorwaardelijke steun' die Ludemann de VS toeschrijft en die velen ook de Nederlandse regering toeschrijven, en even onterecht.\n\nDan beweer je weer dat Israel degene is die vrede blokkeert, terwijl onze stelling is dat er twee partijen schuld zijn en de Arabieren en Palestijnen veel aan zichzelf te wijten hebben.\n\nAls ik iets verkeerd zou hebben gelezen, dan ligt dat waarschijnlijk aan je slechte formuleringen en oeverloze Haaretz plakwerk, waaruit helemaal geen onvoorwaardelijke VS-steun blijkt, alleen dat de regering Bush geheime afspraken zou hebben gemaakt met 1 of meerdere Israelische regeringen over het door de vingers zien van beperkte bouw in de nederzettingen. Dat ze dit door de vingers zagen was evident, alleen de afspraken daarover zijn nieuws.\n\nDe huidige regering is verder niet ultrarechts, maar een coalitie waarin o.a. een in meerdere opzichten ultrarechtse partij zit. De genoemde wetsvoorstellen zijn waarschijnlijk en hopelijk kansloos, hoewel aan een dienstplicht wel goede punten zitten, en ik van een verbod op staatsondermijnende aktiviteiten niet wakker zou liggen. Bij de PA beland je voor minder in de gevangenis. Ratna en Wouter,\n\nEen bekend menselijke tekortkoming is, om in de woorden van iemand slechts datgene te 'horen', dat je wil horen. En niet, wat wat iemand wil zeggen.",

Mexico's only remaining legacy carrier is seeing its domestic market share slide as it focuses more on international expansion.\n\nMexico’s domestic airlines transported about 14 million passengers between Jan-2013 and Jun-2013, which is roughly a 7% increase year-on-year, according to data from Mexico’s DGAC.

According to the US census bureau, Mexico is the second largest trading partner of the US.\n\nDespite the economic uncertainty that began to settle on Mexico in mid-2012, its domestic air traffic has continued to grow. For the month of Jun-2013 domestic traffic increased 8% to about 2.5 million passengers.\n\nGrupo Aeromexico saw its domestic market share fall roughly 3ppts year-on-year for the month of Jun-2013 from 38% to 35%. Aeromexico Connect recorded a 2ppt fall to 18% and Aeromexico mainline recorded a 1ppt decrease to 17%.\n\nMexico’s largest carrier was also the only airline to record a traffic decrease – about 2% – in Jun-2013. \n\n \n\n The drop off in Aeromexico’s domestic traffic reflects the carrier’s 2Q2013 results as its domestic passenger levels dropped by 2% year-on-year while traffic on international routes jumped 7%.

corn leafworm or southern grassworm the bt toxin is meant to provide protection to the crop without needing to be sprayed with insecticide but reports from farmers allege that the bt corn is actually less resistant to attack by spodoptera caterpillars than nongmo varieties now farmers have been forced to apply insecticides to their crops racking up additional environmental and financial costs – after having already paid a premium price for the gm corn seeds deceptive advertising the loss of resistance to bt corn caterpillars was identified by aprosojamt in march when the first reports of emerged from mato grosso producers frightened by what they saw on the field aprosojamt began to gather technical reports with data photos and economic analysis of producers financial losses estimated at 54 per hectare in terms of extra insecticide and application costs the association is now calling on monsanto dupont syngenta and dow companies to offer solutions as well as compensate the farmers for their losses we want companies point to a rapid solution to the losses and also a way to compensate those who were harmed says the president of aprosojamt ricardo tomczyk it is a typical case of product that promised an outcome that was never delivered – ie deceptive advertising blame the farmers the association has given the seed companies ten days in which to offer solutions to the problems presented by the gm varieties as well as a way to compensate the losses faced by farmers in mato grosso but monsanto and other seed companies are unlikely to accommodate the farmers according to reuters seed companies say they warned brazilian farmers to plant part of their corn fields with conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to gmo seeds however tomczyk responded that the seed companies instructions on creating insect refugia of nongmo corn were vague and hard to follow and in any case he added there are barely any nongmo seeds available it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers aprosojamt is attempting to negotiate an agreement with the seed companies but insists that farmers are ready to sue for their pesticide costs not for the first time earlier this year a similar problem arose in the us when scientists confirmed that corndestroying rootworms had evolved to be resistant to the gmo corn engineered to kill them

            "text": "Researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center identified a new source of neutrophils for production of an immunity protein interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in the earliest response to infection. IFN-γ prevents a virus from replicating and also stimulates the immune system to produce other disease-fighting agents. Neutrophils are the major component of pus.\n\nThe new report reveals that neutrophils help produce IFN-γ through a new cellular pathway, which is independent of the pathway through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) as the body’s early warning system against invasion by pathogens.\n\n“We believe our mouse study provides strong evidence that neutrophils, white blood cells created in the bone marrow, produce significant amounts of IFN-γ in response to disease,” said Dr. Felix Yarovinsky, assistant professor of immunology and senior author of the study published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in June. “The finding of a new and essential cellular source for IFN-γ challenges a long-held belief in the field and is significant because neutrophils are the most common kind of white blood cell.”\n\nIn this study, two pathogens were used: Toxoplasma gondii, which causes brain damage in mammals, and Salmonella typhomun, which causes gastroenterit. Innate immunity is the body’s first line of defense against pathogens, including those that have never before encountered, while Adaptive immunity is the secondary system to develop antibodies against pathogens which the body has previously been exposed to. It was believed for a long time that natural killer (NK) cells and T cells are the significant sources of IFN-γ, and the hypothesis that neutrophils also help production of IFN- γ as innate immunity process was ignored for 20 years up to now until Dr. Yarovinsky have identified this new source.\n\nThe researchers began the study about the possibility of neutrophils aiding production of IFN-γ because they found NK and T cell-lacking mice still managed to make IFN-γ using the other source. “Based on what we know about neutrophils, their large numbers and rapid deployment to the site of infection should provide an important means of very early, robust, and rapid elimination of disease-causing agents,” researchers wrote.\n\n“Based on what we know about neutrophils, their large numbers and rapid deployment to the site of infection should provide an important means of very early, robust, and rapid elimination of disease-causing agents,” the researchers wrote. Although neutrophil-derived IFN-γ alone is insufficient to achieve complete host protection, the protein significantly extended the survival of mice in this study, Dr. Yarovinsky said.",

Researchers in Iowa found significant damage from rootworms in corn fields last year.\n\nIn Brazil, the main corn culprit is Spodoptera frugiperda, also known as the corn leafworm or southern grassworm.\n\nSeed companies say they warned Brazilian farmers to plant part of their corn fields with conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to GMO seeds.\n\nDow Agrosciences, a division of Dow Chemical Co, has programs in Brazil to help corn farmers develop \"an integrated pest management system that includes, among other things, the cultivation of refuge areas,\" it said in an email.\n\nAnother company, DuPont, said it had not received any formal notification from Aprosoja. The company's Pioneer brand has been working with producers to extend the durability of its seed technology and improve efficiency since Spodoptera worms were found to have developed resistance to the Cry1F protein, it said in a statement.\n\nMonsanto Co also said in a statement that it has not been formally notified by the group. The other company, Syngenta AG, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTomczyk, who also spoke for Brazilian farmers during a dispute over seed royalty payments to Monsanto that ended last year, said Aprosoja encouraged the planting of refuge areas. But he said the seed companies have not given clear instructions.\n\n\"There are barely any non-GMO seeds available ... it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers,\" he said. Aprosoja hopes to reach a negotiated agreement with the seed companies, but if all else fails farmers may sue to get reparations for pesticide costs, he added.\n\nBrazil is harvesting its second of two annual corn crops and expects to produce 78 million tonnes this crop year, slightly less than last season's record. Domestic prices recently fell to their lowest in four years because of abundant supplies.",

            "text": "Updated estimates of the incidence of several neurological disorders based on review of the current literature are published in Neurology by a collaboration including Deborah Hirtz, M.D., with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health. The estimates include discussion of the incidence of ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease in the U.S.). “Current, accurate estimates of the numbers of people affected by neurological disorders are needed to understand the burden of these conditions on patients, families and society to plan and carry out research on their causes and treatment and to provide adequate services to people who suffer from these illnesses,” said Hirtz in a press statement.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17261678\n\nA separate study carried out in Lombardy, Italy, shows the incidence there of ALS is similar to that elsewhere in the world. The report by the SLALOM group of investigators, led by Ettore Beghi, M.D., of the Mario Negri Institute in Milan, was published in January in Neurology.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17210896\n\nA mutation in the gene coding for the protein, progranulin, was found in a patient with cognitive change who is from a family in which ALS is inherited in a dominant manner, as well as in two other patients with family history of cognitive change, reported investigators online in Neurology in January. Led by Jordan Grafman, Ph.D., of the National Institutes of Health, and collaborators at Indiana University and in Italy, the multinational team of investigators found that the mutation of progranulin in this particular patient produced the symptoms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) although no definitive motor symptoms were apparent. The progranulin gene is on chromosome 17 at a different location than other mutations that also cause FTD. The progranulin gene produces proteins that may have properties of supporting growth and health of neurons.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17202431\n\nAn overlap with a common aspect of ALS occurs in at least some patients with frontotemporal dementia. Dysphagia, or impaired swallowing, often appears as ALS progresses and can be the presenting symptom of bulbar onset ALS, and now it seems this problem also can happen in frontotemporal dementia. A series of 21 FTD patients examined by Bruce Miller, M.D., and colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco, showed abnormalities on fiber optic endoscopic examination of swallowing in 12. Four of the patients’ caregivers had reported some problem with swallowing. The investigators concluded that the appearance of swallowing disorder in FTD marks progression of the disease progress into the brain centers that coordinate the muscles of the throat.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17210809\n\nLeonard H. Van den Berg, M.D., Ph.D., at the University Medical Center in Utrecht, and colleagues showed that variation in a gene involved in the body’s handling of iron may be associated with some instances of ALS. Other researchers have shown this gene variation is associated with ALS occurring nearly twice as often in people with ALS as in those who do not have the disease for populations studied in Ireland and in the U.K.\n\nInvestigation in the Dutch population, now published in January in the Archives of Neurology, showed similarly that people with both copies of the gene for HFE changed by the H63D mutation are twice as likely to have ALS. Those with only one copy changed, and with ALS, tended to get ALS later in life. Mutations in the Hfe gene can result in the iron overload disease called hemochromatosis. Changing iron balance in neurons can produce similar changes to the damage seen with ALS. This is an example of a gene variation that could work together with other factors to produce the disease.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17210810\n\nEarly changes in spinal cord in metal containing proteins, in the metals copper and zinc, and in lipid by products, may be hallmarks of ALS at least in a mouse model as reported by Japanese researchers. The team led by Toyofumi Suzuki, Ph.D., at Nihon University, Chiba, published in Toxicology in January. The increases are apparent at eight weeks in the mice, long before they show any symptoms. Certain forms of the proteins, called metallothioneins, increased further as the mice developed paralysis. These proteins help handle the required metal ions for essential enzymes such as the copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), the enzyme that is altered in some inherited forms of ALS. The investigators concluded that the changes suggest the metallothionein proteins are attempting to counter oxidative stress in the disease.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17097207\n\nCopper ion held by the SOD1 molecule may be a key to how the enzyme is altered by some mutations that cause ALS, according to findings published by David Borchelt, Ph.D., and colleagues at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md. As reported in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in January, the copper ion may be vital to the stable pairing of the SOD1 enzyme which is its normal form. The findings are part of an effort funded by The ALS Association to manipulate internal portions of the protein to define the critical elements within SOD1 responsible for toxicity. The investigations should allow this research team to map the minimal elements within SOD1 that are required to elicit ALS.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17092942\n\nAdding to evidence implicating calcium flow in ALS, the motor neurons appear to uniquely lack the calcium handling ability of other nerve cell types, according to research by British and German investigators. Publishing on line in January in Cell Calcium, Ludo Van Den Bosch, Ph.D., and collaborators at the Medical School in Hannover, and the University of Sheffield, showed in lab dishes motor neurons responding to stimulation by increased inflow of calcium that saturates the calcium buffering of mitochondria. In fact, the motor neurons had lower densities of mitochondria than other neurons. This could explain the selective vulnerability of motor neurons to the disease process in ALS suspected to impair the mitochondria.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17241659\n\nImmunizing mice with the SOD1 mutation using the mutant protein itself to prompt the immune system to destroy what the body is producing helps mice with the mutation survive longer according to research by Jean-Pierre Julien, Ph.D., of the University of Laval, Quebec, Canada, and colleagues. Publishing online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in January, the Canadian team showed that vaccination before symptoms appear could prolong survival in two different SOD1 mutant bearing mice. The strategy was based on the recent findings that the SOD1 protein is secreted by cells, thus allowing the immune system to see it so that a vaccination approach might prompt a response as if the protein is foreign. Only human testing would be able to show that this strategy might work in people with the SOD1 mutation.\n\nJapanese researchers published in the Archives of Neurology in January that mice with the SOD1 mutation survive longer with the disease if crossed with mice that also carry a gene to produce small interfering RNA that inhibits production of SOD1 protein. These researchers led by Hidehiro Mizusawa, M.D., Ph.D., at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University, had shown previously that the mice also have delayed onset of the disease. This is further evidence that RNAi may be a promising therapeutic approach for ALS.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16221675\n\nAs reported in January in the Journal of Neuroscience, California and German researchers could prolong the survival of the SOD1 mouse by breeding with mice with a gene that produces more than the usual amount of VEGF. The double mutant mice lived about twenty days longer without symptoms but progressed as rapidly once their disease appeared. This report from the team led by David Greenberg, M.D., Ph.D., Buck Institute, Novato, and colleagues from the University of Heidelberg, adds to the evidence that this supportive molecule can protect motor neurons against the toxic action of the SOD1. Treatment strategies to boost exposure of motor neurons to VEGF are being explored.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17215390\n\nInvestigators at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock, published findings, first presented at the Society for Neuroscience meeting last fall, that a selective drug that acts at a particular cannabinoid receptor increased lifespan by a couple of weeks in SOD1 mice. The beneficial effect occurred when the drug treatment was started at symptom onset in the mice. Most likely, the cannabinoid effect is through modulation of inflammation, concluded the researchers, led by John Crow, Ph.D., and Paul Prather, Ph.D., writing in the Journal of Neuroscience in January. Other suggestive findings were reported by British investigators (see monthly journal news for May 2006) http://www.alsa.org/research/article.cfm?id=969&CFID=2&CFTOKEN=68144428), who found that SOD1 mutant mice lacking one of the natural receptors for cannabinoids on their cells did show longer life but no change of disease onset. Whether or not this class of drugs can hold promise for treatment of ALS remains to be demonstrated in a well-designed clinical trial. The ALS Association supports additional research into the potential for cannabinoids in ALS but cautions that the mix of compounds in marijuana does not have proven efficacy in the disease.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17241118\n\nCaterina Bendotti, M.D., Ph.D., and colleagues at the Mario Negri Institute in Milan, Italy, and collaborators at the University of Palermo, show that a protein involved in inflammation changes during the disease in mice with the mutation in the SOD1 protein most clearly in glial cells. High mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is a protein found in the nucleus of most cells that can activate inflammatory processes. It could provide a new target at which to aim potential therapeutics in ALS according to the findings reported in January in Neuroscience Letters.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17196331\n\nItalian investigators looked for changes in levels of proteins in the SOD1 mouse early in life before symptoms appear and found that altered protein amounts include those molecules with a role in mitochondrial function, the handling of abnormal deposits within cells, and the cellular response to stress. The researchers also found a change in cyclophilin A, a molecule that protects cells from oxidative stress. The team led by Valentina Bonetto at the Dulbecco Telethon Institute and colleagues at the Mario Negri Institute in Milan, Italy, published online in December in the Biochemical and\n\nInvestigators at Wake Forest University led by Anthony Atala, M.D., collaborating with Harvard and Children’s Hospital colleagues published in Nature Biotechnology in January that stem cells found in amniotic fluid samples left over from prenatal tests can generate neurons that implant and integrate into newborn mouse brain. These are cells shed by the fetus. The percent of stem cells surviving was actually enhanced by a neurodegenerative condition caused by an inherited lack of an essential enzyme in a mouse model called twitcher. This suggests an alternative source for stem cells that avoids ethical issues yet still provides a possible therapeutic approach to diseases such as ALS. Further research will need to confirm and extend the findings.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17206138\n\nIn the mouse model used by the stem cell researchers cited above, nerve cells die when an enzyme defect causes accumulation of waste fats within the storage sacs called lysozymes. This storage disorder, called Krabbe disease in people, kills mice rapidly after birth. Affected mice given a combination of a gene therapy to replace the defective gene did far better if also given a bone marrow transplant. Apparently the marrow replacement counters brain inflammation the investigators suggested. The team led by Mark Sands, Ph.D., at Washington University in St. Louis, reported in Molecular Therapy in January. ALS research has identified inflammation as an important aspect, and some attempts at bone marrow treatment suggest this might be worth investigating further in the disease, perhaps as part of a combined treatment strategy.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17164774",

            "text": "Over two million protesters rallied in 300 cities in 44 countries around the world on Saturday, as part of a global protest against the seed giant Monsanto and the genetically modified food it produces.\n\nThe debate over genetically engineered food has been going on since the FDA concluded that there was no difference between genetically engineered and non-engineered plants in 1992. Genetic engineering advocates claim that the GMOs could reduce World hunger and increase nutritional quality in foods. Unfortunately, most of these claims have been debunked repeatedly, as Anna Lappe explains in her 2011 article on Civil Eats.\n\nThe March Against Monsanto movement is initiated by the founder and organizer Tami Canal. She has created a Facebook page on Feb. 28 calling for a rally against the company’s practices.\n\nMonsanto representatives told the Associated Press that the company respects people’s rights to express their opinions on the topic, but it stands by the seeds it sells.\n\nGenetically modified plants are grown from seeds that are engineered to resist insecticides and herbicides. Most corn, soybean and cotton crops grown in the United States today have been genetically modified.\n\nChina, Russia, and about 60 other countries require labeling if a food contains GMO ingredients. Despite efforts on state and federal levels to require labeling, at the present GMOs do not have to be labeled in U.S.A.\n\nThe Proposition 37 which would have made California the first state in the nation to require labels on some fresh produce and processed foods whose DNA has been altered by scientists, have been defeated last November.\n\nOn March 2013, President Barack Obama signed off on a bill what has become widely known as “the Monsanto Protection Act” or formally titled HR 933: Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act 2013. Without any hearings on the matter, the Senate included language that gives the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) the power to override any court ruling that would otherwise halt the planting of new genetically-engineered crops.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Senate rejected 71 to 27 an amendment to the 2013 farm bill that would let states require labels on food or beverages made with genetically modified ingredients.\n\nOne of the reasons for Monsanto’s extraterritoriality is that the company has significant influence on U.S.A Government. Over the past decades, at least seven high-ranking employees in the FDA had employment history with the Monsanto Company.\n\nMonsanto is experiencing multiple international backlash. Five million Brazilian farmers are suing the Biotech giant for as much as 6.2 billion euros. They say that the company has been collecting royalties on crops it unfairly claims as its own.\n\nIn 2004, the public pressure was so intense against Monsanto’s emerging presence in Costa Rica that the biotech giant voluntarily withdrew its business efforts from the country entirely.\n\nIn 2010, shortly after the massive earthquake ravaged Haiti, U.S. has donated 400 tons of Monsanto aid seed to the country. In a remarkable display of protest, 10,000 Haitian farmers gathered and burned the entire donation of seeds.\n\nThere are multiple reports on several other countries fighting against the GMO crops such as Hungary’s decision to destroy nearly 1000 acres of corn because they were grown with genetically modified organisms, and China’s removing three shipments of GM corn imported from the US, because they were not labeled properly.\n\nIf you are not alarmed yet and want to give the benefit of doubt to the company, as I personally was trying to do, read this article titled: Monsanto hires infamous mercenary firm Blackwater to track activists around the world. If the Bio-tech giant is innocent, why does it need a private army?\n\nOne protestor was carrying a sign explained the problem with GMOs and Monsanto clearly:",

indicated that united states senators gillibrand elizabeth warren dmass and dianne feinstein dcalif sent a letter today to food and drug administration fda commissioner margaret hamburg requesting information about the fdas efforts to curb the overuse of antibiotics in food animal production the use of antibiotics in foodproducing animals must be reduced as part of the effort to preserve the efficacy of antibiotics the senators wrote research has shown that antibiotic resistant bacteria are most likely to develop when antibiotics are used continuously at low doses – the type of regimen used frequently in food animal production in their letter the senators noted steps the fda has taken to begin addressing this issue including issuing guidance on inappropriate antibiotic use for growth promotion calling for pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily remove these uses from product labels and requiring more veterinary oversight of antibiotic use in food animals the senators explained while these new policies are important first steps we remain concerned that they may not be sufficient to effectively curtail the routine use of dangerously low doses of antibiotics for the duration of an animals life the benefits of this change will be negligible if the same animals can continue receiving the same antibiotics at the same doses also yesterday the washington insider section of dtn link requires subscription noted that few public concerns have deeper or more controversial roots than those regarding the growing bacterial resistance to modern drugs because much of the nations drug use is for livestock many activist groups have been pressing the food and drug administration for tougher regulations however a recent federal appeals court decision reversed two lower court rulings and appears to make bans on antibiotics in livestock less likely the decision came as a surprise to many observers and certainly appears to support fdas strategy of building voluntary programs to curb antibiotics overuse by livestock operations the decision itself was by the us court of appeals for the second circuit in new york specifically it means fda is no longer required to proceed with hearings to determine whether to withdraw approval of medically important antibiotics use in livestock feed earlier district court rulings would have required the hearings the dtn item added that it is not completely clear why fda did not go forward with hearings but it is clear that proposals to largely prohibit livestock antibiotic use were enormously unpopular among livestock producers and their supporters in congress important congressional committees said they wouldnt approve the hearing process unless they had conclusive evidence linking overuse of antibiotics in livestock to human health so far experts conclude that evidence has not been found meanwhile tim devaney reported yesterday at the hill online that the us department of agriculture usda is looking to relax import restrictions on some mexican pork that were put in place to prevent pigs with swine fever from coming into the country the usda said monday it is looking to establish new safeguards for mexican farmers that raise and slaughter pigs which are intended to limit the spread of swine fever among pigs farmers that follow these proposed rules would be allowed to export pork to the us and jerry hagstrom reported earlier this week at national journal online that is it worth the effort for an environmental protection agency administrator in a democratic administration to meet with her farm ranch and republican critics or should she stay safely among her environmental and conservation supporters in washington and the coastal cities and just push ahead the national journal article noted that epa administrator gina mccarthy who is under fire in rural america for a waters of the united states rule that epa and the army corps of engineers proposed in april has been making the effort with a trip to missouri early in july and a meeting last week with republicans on the senate agriculture committee who have been asking for a sitdown since may the outreach hasnt stopped the criticism but mccarthy told hagstrom in an interview thursday that she feels the effort has been worth it mccarthy said the trip to missouri was a signal that this rule is very important to epa on capitol hill she said she learned that epa speaks with a lot of technical language and science it is not readily translated into what is clear on the ground for the farm community a news release yesterday from sen john hoeven r nd stated that hoeven a member of the senate agriculture committee met last week with environmental protection agency epa administrator gina mccarthy to press again for the agency to abandon its proposed waters of the us rule hoeven said farmers and ranchers are concerned by the proposal that significantly expands epa authority to regulate small wetlands creeks stock ponds and ditches under the clean water act cwa we made it clear to the administrator that the epa needs to abandon this proposed rule said hoeven their proposal is causing uncertainty for our farmers and ranchers and making it more difficult and more expensive for our producers to do their jobs the last thing they need is the burden of additional regulations and litigation farm bill dave russell reported yesterday at brownfield that over 200 farmers attended a farm bill implementation forum at bowling green state university on friday july 25 sponsored by ohio farmers union the forum was designed to provide insight into what the new farm bill provides and while complex joe shultz chief economist for the senate agriculture committee says it also provides farmers with options it does look a lot different than the previous farm bills but i think that reflects the diversity of agriculture and really the strength of american agriculture said shultz it will be a good bill and it offer some real options to producers the update noted that weve also provided more tools for farmers to get educated the farm bill provides some money for outreach and education meetings were also providing some online decision making tools so producers can enter their data their farm history online and get some good information about which decision makes the most sense for their operation shultz said the usdas economic research service ers released a report yesterday additionality in us agricultural conservation and regulatory offset programs which noted in part that additionality is achieved when a conservation program payment results in actions that improve environmental performance of the farm and that would not have occurred without the payment ers estimates additionality in various programs the ers report added that the federal government spent more than 6 billion in fiscal year 2013 on voluntary conservation payment programs to encourage the adoption of a wide range of conservation practices that address multiple environmental and resource conservation goalswhen a voluntary payment causes a change in practices that leads to improved environmental quality these changes are additional for any type of voluntary payment there is some risk that the farmers or ranchers who receive them would have adopted the required practices even without the payment this study measures additionality for a number of common conservation practices typically supported by voluntary conservation payments and examines ways to increase additionality in part the ers report added that for existing conservation programs high levels of additionality are observed for structural practices which tend to be expensive to install and often yield modest onfarm benefits at least in the short run for soil conservation structures terraces grade stabilization and water and sediment basins and buffer practices filter strips riparian buffers grassed waterways and field borders we estimated that 82 and 80 percent of farms applying these practices respectively would not have done so without a conservation payment to help defray costs on many farms the cost of installing these practices is likely to exceed the extra profit or other benefits that the farmer expects to receive even though there can be significant benefits to society through environmental gain and maintenance of longterm soil productivity for conservation management practices the evidence on additionality in existing programs is mixed our estimate of additionality in conservation tillage is low relative to our estimates for structural practices 56 percent although it is higher than a previous estimate for nutrient management we estimate that farmers who receive payments are much more likely to have written nutrient management plans for an estimated 88 percent of farms that have written nutrient or manure management plans conservation payments prompted plan development meanwhile an update yesterday at the ers charts gallery indicated that federal eligibility rules for usdas supplemental nutrition assistance program snap stipulate that households must meet three financial criteria gross income net income and asset limitsstates using broadbased categorical eligibility criteria are allowed to eliminate the asset limit and increase the monthly gross income limit from 130 percent of the federal poverty line up to 200 percent when determining snap eligibility this new eligibility option is among the many legislative and regulatory efforts to simplify snap administration and increase program access especially for lowincome working families during the discussions leading up to the agricultural act of 2014 concerns were raised that the broadbased categorical eligibility option had allowed assistance to expand beyond the poorest americans in 2012 52 percent of snap households had incomes above 130 percent of the federal poverty line–compared to 10 percent in 2000–and they received 15 percent of total snap benefits related chart in other policy related developments a news release yesterday from usdas national agricultural statistics service nass stated that nass today released the 2012 census of agriculture congressional district profiles for the 113th congress biofuels timothy cama reported yesterday at the hill online that sen chuck grassley riowa said monday that he had proposed amendments that would restore the tax credits for wind energy and biodiesel production both measures would amend the bring jobs home act which seeks to discourage outsourcing jobs by ending certain tax credits the wind and biodiesel incentives popular in iowa because they benefits industries common to the state expired last year climate issues timothy cama reported yesterday at the hill online that food producer general mills inc committed monday to reducing climate changecausing greenhouse gas ghg emissions from its entire supply chain including the farms that produce its ingredients the company behind brands like cheerios betty crocker and häagendazs set ghg targets for its own operations in 2005 but mondays announcement goes much further its latest climate commitment

            "text": "Reuters writer Caroline Stauffer reported yesterday that, “Genetically modified corn seeds are no longer protecting Brazilian farmers from voracious tropical bugs, increasing costs as producers turn to pesticides, a farm group said on Monday.\n\n“Producers want four major manufacturers of so-called BT corn seeds to reimburse them for the cost of spraying up to three coats of pesticides this year, said Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja farm lobby in Mato Grosso state.\n\n“‘The caterpillars should die if they eat the corn, but since they didn’t die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reais ($54) per hectare … at a time that corn prices are terrible,’ he said.”\n\nThe article added that, “Experts in the United States have also warned about corn production prospects because of a growing bug resistance to genetically modified corn. Researchers in Iowa found significant damage from rootworms in corn fields last year.”\n\nCheri Zagurski and Emily Unglesbee reported yesterday at DTN (link requires subscription) that, “More than three-quarters of the nation’s corn crop has silked and nearly 20% has moved into the dough stage, according to USDA’s latest weekly Crop Progress report.”\n\n“Corn condition worsened slightly with one percentage point moving from the good rating [54% to 53%] and into the poor category [75% of the corn crop is rated good to excellent]… . Soybean condition worsened with 71% rated good to excellent, compared to 73% last week.”\n\nBloomberg writer Jeff Wilson reported yesterday that, “Soybean futures rose the most in nine weeks on concern that dry weather forecast into August will curtail yields in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower.”\n\nAlso, Bloomberg writer Phoebe Sedgman reported today that, “Australia cut the odds of El Nino, which brings drought to Asia and heavy rain to South America, after parts of the tropical Pacific Ocean cooled.\n\n“The chance of the pattern developing this year is about 50 percent, the Bureau of Meteorology said in an update on its website. The forecaster lowered its outlook to an El Nino watch from an alert, which was issued on May 6.”\n\nSee also this recent NOAA update titled, “What’s the hold up, El Niño?“\n\nIn transportation news, an update yesterday from Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) indicated that, “[Sen. Thune] today announced the release of a new rail service section on his official website where South Dakota shippers concerned with inconsistent rail service can find the latest South Dakota rail developments. On the site, South Dakota shippers and consumers will find the most up-to-date actions taken by Thune, access grain car reports, find contact information for the Surface Transportation Board (STB), and can leave a message for the senator about the problems they’ve experienced.”\n\nPaul Vieira reported yesterday at The Wall Street Journal Online that, “The head of Canada’s biggest railroad Monday said the rail system is ready to handle the coming harvest and urged the Canadian government not to impose a heavier regulatory burden on the movement of grain.”\n\nIn trade news, Bloomberg writer Brian Wingfield reported yesterday that, “Facing tougher sanctions over Ukraine, Russia said yesterday it may ban imports of chicken from the U.S. and fruit from Europe and is investigating McDonald’s Corp. cheese for safety.\n\n“While Russia and the U.S. have long sparred over agricultural trade, the actions fueled speculation they could be retaliatory. The 28-nation European Union and the U.S. plan to impose stiffer sanctions to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government.”\n\nIn a recent letter (July 27) to Sec. of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, U.S. Grains Council Chairman Julius Schaaf indicated in part that, “As you are aware, China this week unofficially announced that it would require official U.S. government certification that export cargoes of DDGS bound for China do not contain even trace levels of MIR 162, a biotech event not yet approved in China. This action is arbitrary, capricious, a major impediment to trade, and a direct threat to the viability not only of DDGS exports but to the U.S. ethanol industry as a whole. I am writing, therefore, to urge your immediate, direct, and personal intervention with your counterpart in China, Agriculture Minister Han, to halt this current regulatory sabotage of the DDGS trade with China.”\n\nA news release yesterday from Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) indicated that, “United States Senators [Gillibrand], Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) sent a letter today to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Margaret Hamburg requesting information about the FDA’s efforts to curb the overuse of antibiotics in food animal production.\n\n“‘The use of antibiotics in food-producing animals must be reduced as part of the effort to preserve the efficacy of antibiotics,’ the senators wrote. ‘Research has shown that antibiotic resistant bacteria are most likely to develop when antibiotics are used continuously at low doses – the type of regimen used frequently in food animal production.’\n\n“In their letter, the senators noted steps the FDA has taken to begin addressing this issue, including issuing guidance on inappropriate antibiotic use for growth promotion, calling for pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily remove these uses from product labels, and requiring more veterinary oversight of antibiotic use in food animals. The senators explained, ‘While these new policies are important first steps, we remain concerned that they may not be sufficient to effectively curtail the routine use of dangerously low doses of antibiotics for the duration of an animal’s life. . . . The benefits of this change will be negligible . . . if the same animals can continue receiving the same antibiotics at the same doses.’”\n\nAlso yesterday, the “Washington Insider” section of DTN (link requires subscription) noted that, “Few public concerns have deeper or more controversial roots than those regarding the growing bacterial resistance to modern drugs. Because much of the nation’s drug use is for livestock, many activist groups have been pressing the Food and Drug Administration for tougher regulations. However, a recent federal appeals court decision reversed two lower court rulings and appears to make bans on antibiotics in livestock less likely.\n\n“The decision came as a surprise to many observers, and certainly appears to support FDA’s strategy of building voluntary programs to curb antibiotics overuse by livestock operations.\n\n“The decision itself was by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York. Specifically, it means FDA is no longer required to proceed with hearings to determine whether to withdraw approval of medically important antibiotics use in livestock feed. Earlier district court rulings would have required the hearings.”\n\nThe DTN item added that, “It is not completely clear why FDA did not go forward with hearings, but it is clear that proposals to largely prohibit livestock antibiotic use were enormously unpopular among livestock producers and their supporters in Congress. Important Congressional committees said they wouldn’t approve the hearing process unless they had conclusive evidence linking overuse of antibiotics in livestock to human health. So far, experts conclude, that evidence has not been found.”\n\nMeanwhile, Tim Devaney reported yesterday at The Hill Online that, “The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is looking to relax import restrictions on some Mexican pork that were put in place to prevent pigs with swine fever from coming into the country.\n\n“The USDA said Monday it is looking to establish new safeguards for Mexican farmers that raise and slaughter pigs, which are intended to limit the spread of swine fever among pigs.\n\n“Farmers that follow these proposed rules would be allowed to export pork to the U.S.”\n\nAnd Jerry Hagstrom reported earlier this week at National Journal Online that, “Is it worth the effort for an Environmental Protection Agency administrator in a Democratic administration to meet with her farm, ranch, and Republican critics?\n\n“Or should she stay safely among her environmental and conservation supporters in Washington and the coastal cities and just push ahead?”\n\nThe National Journal article noted that, “EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, who is under fire in rural America for a ‘Waters of the United States’ rule that EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers proposed in April, has been making the effort, with a trip to Missouri early in July and a meeting last week with Republicans on the Senate Agriculture Committee who have been asking for a sit-down since May.\n\n“The outreach hasn’t stopped the criticism, but McCarthy told [Hagstrom] in an interview Thursday that she feels the effort has been worth it. McCarthy said the trip to Missouri was ‘a signal that this rule is very important to EPA.’ On Capitol Hill she said she learned that ‘EPA speaks with a lot of technical language and science. It is not readily translated into what is clear on the ground for the farm community.’”\n\nA news release yesterday from Sen. John Hoeven (R., N.D.) stated that, “[Hoeven], a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, met last week with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy to press again for the agency to abandon its proposed ‘Waters of the U.S.’ rule. Hoeven said farmers and ranchers are concerned by the proposal that significantly expands EPA authority to regulate small wetlands, creeks, stock ponds and ditches under the Clean Water Act (CWA).\n\n“‘We made it clear to the Administrator that the EPA needs to abandon this proposed rule,’ said Hoeven. ‘Their proposal is causing uncertainty for our farmers and ranchers and making it more difficult and more expensive for our producers to do their jobs. The last thing they need is the burden of additional regulations and litigation.’”\n\nDave Russell reported yesterday at Brownfield that, “Over 200 farmers attended a Farm Bill Implementation Forum at Bowling Green State University on Friday, July 25.\n\n“Sponsored by Ohio Farmers Union the Forum was designed to provide insight into what the new Farm Bill provides and while complex, Joe Shultz, Chief Economist for the Senate Agriculture Committee says it also provides farmers with options.\n\n“‘It does look a lot different than the previous Farm Bills, but I think that reflects the diversity of agriculture and really the strength of American agriculture,’ said Shultz. ‘It will be a good bill and it offer some real options to producers.’”\n\nThe update noted that, “‘We’ve also provided more tools for farmers to get educated, the Farm Bill provides some money for outreach and education meetings, we’re also providing some online decision making tools so producers can enter their data, their farm history online and get some good information about which decision makes the most sense for their operation,’ Shultz said.”\n\nThe USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) released a report yesterday (“Additionality in U.S. Agricultural Conservation and Regulatory Offset Programs“) which noted in part that, “‘Additionality’ is achieved when a conservation program payment results in actions that improve environmental performance of the farm and that would not have occurred without the payment. ERS estimates additionality in various programs.”\n\nThe ERS report added that, “The Federal Government spent more than $6 billion in fiscal year 2013 on voluntary conservation payment programs to encourage the adoption of a wide range of conservation practices that address multiple environmental and resource conservation goals…When a voluntary payment causes a change in practice(s) that leads to improved environmental quality, these changes are ‘additional.’ For any type of voluntary payment, there is some risk that the farmers or ranchers who receive them would have adopted the required practice(s), even without the payment. This study measures additionality for a number of common conservation practices typically supported by voluntary conservation payments and examines ways to increase additionality.”\n\nIn part, the ERS report added that, “For existing conservation programs, high levels of additionality are observed for structural practices, which tend to be expensive to install and often yield modest onfarm benefits, at least in the short run. For soil conservation structures ( terraces, grade stabilization, and water and sediment basins) and buffer practices (filter strips, riparian buffers, grassed waterways, and field borders) we estimated that 82 and 80 percent of farms applying these practices, respectively, would not have done so without a conservation payment to help defray costs. On many farms, the cost of installing these practices is likely to exceed the extra profit or other benefits that the farmer expects to receive, even though there can be significant benefits to society through environmental gain and maintenance of long-term soil productivity.\n\n“For conservation management practices, the evidence on additionality in existing programs is mixed. Our estimate of additionality in conservation tillage is low relative to our estimates for structural practices (56 percent), although it is higher than a previous estimate. For nutrient management, we estimate that farmers who receive payments are much more likely to have written nutrient management plans. For an estimated 88 percent of farms that have written nutrient or manure management plans, conservation payments prompted plan development.”\n\nMeanwhile, an update yesterday at the ERS charts gallery indicated that, “Federal eligibility rules for USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) stipulate that households must meet three financial criteria: gross income, net income, and asset limits.States using broad-based categorical eligibility criteria are allowed to eliminate the asset limit and increase the monthly gross income limit from 130 percent of the Federal poverty line up to 200 percent when determining SNAP eligibility. This new eligibility option is among the many legislative and regulatory efforts to simplify SNAP administration and increase program access, especially for low-income working families. During the discussions leading up to the Agricultural Act of 2014, concerns were raised that the broad-based categorical eligibility option had allowed assistance to expand beyond the poorest Americans. In 2012, 5.2 percent of SNAP households had incomes above 130 percent of the Federal poverty line–compared to 1.0 percent in 2000–and they received 1.5 percent of total SNAP benefits[related chart].”\n\nIn other policy related developments, a news release yesterday from USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) stated that, “[NASS] today released the 2012 Census of Agriculture Congressional District Profiles for the 113th Congress.”\n\nTimothy Cama reported yesterday at The Hill Online that, “Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said Monday that he had proposed amendments that would restore the tax credits for wind energy and biodiesel production.\n\n“Both measures would amend the Bring Jobs Home Act, which seeks to discourage outsourcing jobs by ending certain tax credits. The wind and biodiesel incentives, popular in Iowa because they benefits industries common to the state, expired last year.”\n\nTimothy Cama reported yesterday at The Hill Online that, “Food producer General Mills Inc. committed Monday to reducing climate change-causing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its entire supply chain, including the farms that produce its ingredients.\n\n“The company behind brands like Cheerios, Betty Crocker and Häagen-Dazs set GHG targets for its own operations in 2005, but Monday’s announcement goes much further.  Its latest climate commitment also covers water use and waste.”",

concluding part of the article on gmos you can read the first part here if you missed it lastweek gmos and their hazards to our future health part i by olalekan anifowose response by gbadebo rhodesvivour with all due respect mr adesinas response aside from being vague and empty has not addressed any concerns raised by my article in playing politics with the nigerian people he has spoken about everything except the elephant in the room mr adesina asserts nigeria does not have gmos sir what is monsanto doing in nigeria in the month of may 2014 an article titled government okays introduction of 40 hybrid seeds in nigeria was published in the guardian newspaper another article titled monsanto to introduce 40 new seed varieties was also published and monsantos vice president michael frank was quoted saying that monsanto would focus on maize soybean cotton and oilgrape seed production in nigeria according to the nabda boss nigeria biotechnology development agency nigeria already has three genetically engineered crops in confined field trial he names them as bt cowpea in zaria the african biofortified sorghum also in zaria and the cassava plus at the national root crops institute at umudike abia state the institute for agricultural research iar in zaria in association with monsanto and csiro in australia have created bt cowpea using genes derived from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis which was provided by monsanto and have carried out field trials ezezika dall 2012 mr minister there is nothing conventional or natural about monsanto transgenic modifications neither is there anything natural about inserting dna from bacteria into cowpea it is clear from these experiments and associations that nigerian agencies and institutes have become merely surrogates for experimentation on behalf of foreigncommercial interests mr adesina asserts all the seeds used by farmers in nigeria are from conventional breeding and we allow farmers to reuse their own seeds is that the monsanto model there are so many case studies around the world that proves that this is not monsantos model prof iwu had this to say about the monsanto model one of the things they do and they do badly is that they will bring these things they will give our farmers seeds for example and they will plant these seeds regardless of whether the seeds are safe or not you can not replant the seeds the next year you will go back and start buying from them and after a while there will be total dependency and these things can be airborne and they can destroy our farms and so on prof maurice iwu professor of pharmacognosy at the university of nigeria nsukka unn nnimmo bassey had this to say about the monsanto model we can not be forcefed by a savage biotech industry that seeks to colonise african seeds and food systems the fact that gmos will not feed the world is well studied and documented see the international assessment of agricultural knowledge science and technology for development iaastd report for example gmos will enslave the world through the intellectual property rights that allows the biotech industry to patent their seeds debars farmers from sharing or saving seeds and forces them to buy seeds every planting season it seeks to overturn age long sustainable practices nnimmo bassey nigerian environmentalist chair of friends of the earth international 20082012 so again i ask what is monsanto doing in nigeria mr adesina asserts nigeria is putting in place bio safety laws to regulate use of modern biotechnology consumer and environmental safety are priority for us ify aniebo a molecular geneticist had this to say about the consumer and environmental safety of monsanto gmo the few scientific researches done on the effects of these foods on humans have showed stunted growth impaired immune systems bleeding stomachs abnormal and potentially precancerous cell growth in the intestines impaired blood cell development misshaped cell structures in the liver pancreas and testicles altered gene expression and cell metabolism liver and kidney lesions partially atrophied livers inflamed kidneys less developed organs reduced digestive enzymes higher blood sugar inflamed lung tissue increased death rates and higher offspring mortality as well after gm soy was introduced in the uk allergies from the product skyrocketed by 50 percent and in the us in the 1980s a gm food supplement killed dozens and left five to 10 thousand others sick or disabled repeated use of seeds like monsantos roundupready soybeans results in vicious new superweeds that need far greater amounts of stronger herbicides to combat their toxic residues remain in crops that humans and animals then eat even small amounts of these toxins are endocrine disruptors that can affect human reproduction adversely most recently tests showed the presence of the herbicide glyphosate widely used with monsantos herbicidetolerant gm soybean and maize varieties in samples of mothers breast milk in the united states ify aniebo bsc msc mres mphis a molecular geneticist from oxford university with a masters in public health she was also recognized by nigerias president goodluck jonathan during the centenary celebrations as an inventor and innovator again i ask what is monsanto doing in nigeria the minister presents the biosafety law as an infrastructure that would look out for the interest of nigerians by rigorously testing gmo products to ensure they are safe for consumption as well as the ecosystem here is what the chairman senate committee on science and technology prof robert boroffice had to say on the biosafety bill i can speak authoritatively that mr president will be anxious to enact a biosafety law when he gets the passed bill before him for the interest of the country he will sign so that monsanto and other countries can come to nigeria to assist us in boosting agricultural production not only in food but also in area of cotton cowpea maize tomatoes somehow before the bill has been passed it is clear monsanto has prequalified is that how a biosafety bill should work mr minister it is clear that this biosafety bill is nothing more than a gateway to guarantee monsantos entry into nigeria this coupled with the ministers framework which is available online makes it clear the focus is on big business as opposed to the safety and welfare of the nigerian people mr adesina asserts we must not become misinformed by those that want africa to remain backward with misguided antitechnology views lets see how monsanto gmo has fared in other parts of the world in india for example monsanto crop failures are linked to the suicides of 300000 cotton farmers according to physicist and author vandana shiva monsantos contributions to a suicide economy in india such as an increase in the price per kilogram of cotton seeds from 7 to 17000 rupees shiva lists additional complications indigenous cotton varieties can be intercropped with food crops monsantos btcotton can only be grown as a monoculture indigenous cotton is rain fed btcotton needs irrigation indigenous varieties are pest resistant btcotton even though promoted as resistant to the bollworm has created new pests and to control these new pests farmers are using 13 times more pesticides than they were using prior to introduction of btcotton and finally monsanto sells its gmo seeds on fraudulent claims of yields of 1500kgyear when farmers harvest 300400 kgyear on an average according to hrh prince charles of england the crisis branded the gm genocide by campaigners was highlighted recently when prince charles claimed that the issue of gm had become a global moral question – and the time had come to end its unstoppable march he condemned the truly appalling and tragic rate of small farmer suicides in india stemming from the failure of many monsanto gm crop varieties in brazil five million brazilian farmers are locked in a lawsuit with usbased biotech giant monsanto suing for as much as 62 billion euros monsanto gets paid when it sell the seeds the law gives producers the right to multiply the seeds they buy and nowhere in the world is there a requirement to pay again producers are in effect paying a private tax on production jane berwanger lawyer for the farmers in the latest installment of the legal battle erupting in south america the brazilian court has ruled in favor of the brazilian farmers saying monsanto owes them at least us2 billion so i ask for the umpteenth time sir what is monsanto doing in nigeria mr adesina uses a myopic and simplistic analogy to trivialize our health concerns in relation to risks associated with gm technology he speaks of donkeys and planes phones and match boxes dr adesina prof borroface have two million people marched against the airline industry or one airline company have 2 million people marched against the mobile phone industry the answer is a resounding no two million people all around the world in 436 cities have marched against monsanto globally protesting the negative health effects and harm their technology does to human beings and the environment why because the risks associated with this technology far outweighs the benefits but ill humour you lets say those two million people and everyone i have quoted in this article is antiscience and needs in your words educating are the 6 countries of the g8 antiscience too is the technology powerhouse – japan antiscience yet they banned gmos and have strong biosafety laws preventing and inhibiting the importation of gmo products in to their country france and manufacturing powerhouse germany banned monsanto cultivation and gmo products italy banned cultivation of monsanto and gm products england does not allow cultivation of monsanto crops and only allows gm products in to the country as animal feed and even this is under scrutiny lastly the world super power russia banned all monsanto products as well as gm products entering the country in the words of the russian prime minister medvedev if the americans like to eat gmo products let them eat it then we dont need to do that we have enough space and opportunities to produce organic food while our minister and senator are trying to pass a bill to allow monsanto to come in to nigeria russia is passing a bill to treat producers of biotech crops from companies such as monsanto the dow chemical company and syngenta as criminals with fines comparable to terrorism as coauthor of the bill kirill cherkasov said when a terrorist act is committed only several people are usually hurt but gmos may hurt dozens and hundreds the consequences are much worse and punishment should be proportionate to the crime so the question remains and i ask again what is monsanto doing in nigeria mr minister mr senator do you have as robust an infrastructure as russia japan or france do you plan to set it up overnight do you have the scientific infrastructure to monitor monsanto mr minister you clearly need to educate the leaders of all these great nations as well once you are done educating me do you have more scientists at your disposal than france germany or japan or are we basing our policy on america and what america tells us is safe a nation which is controlled by profit at any cost corporations a speech made by us rep dennis kucinich on the house of congress floor in 1992 the food and drug administration decided that genetically modified organisms gmos are the functional equivalent of conventional foods they arrived at this decision without testing gmos for allergenicity toxicity antibiotic resistance and functional characteristics as a result hundreds of millions of acres of gmo crops were planted in america without the knowledge or consent of the american people no safety testing and no long term health studies the fda americass version of nafdac has received over a million comments from citizens demanding labelling of gmos ninety percent of americans agree so why no labelling ill give you one reason the influence and the corruption of the political process by monsanto monsanto has been a prime mover in gmo technology a multimillion dollar gmo lobby here and a major political contributor mr adesina asserts unless africa uses modern technologies our farmers output will remain low and we will remain dependent on others to feed us on this i agree with mr minister so i ask sir have you fully mechanized the nigerian agriculture sector do farmers have access to funding in the form of soft loans of all the money purportedly set aside for the agricultural sector how many farmers have actually accessed those funds how is nigeria doing with regards to the maputo declaration you clearly have a reference for what optimum productivity should be do nigerian farmers get subsidized like their european or american counterparts do they yet according to the imf in its largest countries by agricultural output at purchasing power parity nigeria is ranked no 5 second to the usa which is ranked no 4 and all this was achieved without machinery and without access to funds or subsidies like their american counterparts clearly giving them all that is too much work so you propose magic seeds nigeria is dependent on imports not only due to previous issues raised but also the fact that we do not process our products eg rice till today nigeria a nation is boasting about 900million revenue from the export of raw cocoa raw cocoa in the 21st century cocoa has made men fortunes since the 1800s yet we still export raw cocoa mars inc made 30billion annual turnover and that is just one chocolate company ignoring all the byproducts of cocoa processing surely it would make a lot more sense for nigeria to at least process her cocoa nigerian leadership has to evolve from its fire brigade paradigm in which it favors corporations and special interest to exploit the nation at the detriment of its people case in point the niger delta people complained for years concerning the destruction of their land and their waters and they could not feed themselves leadership ignored their calls champions of their cause lost their lives nigeria behaved as though the oil was for nigeria but the oil spill was for the niger delta it was only when these people after years of complaints took up guns that nigerian leadership paid attention today we pay billions in amnesty every year what would it have cost nigeria to have listened back then to have enforced oil companies to clean up and do the right thing as they do in their own countries would it not have been cheaper for nigeria on the long run we are paying this price in the north currently because leaders have put selfish interest above those of the nigerian people argentina the poster child of monsanto is currently experiencing what i just spoke of research released from communities around farms where monsanto is implementing its technology showed an increase in risk for defects at birth due to exposure to pesticides in mothers the specific defects included were limb reduction urogenital anomalies cns defects orofacial clefts heart conditions and ocular defects so again i ask what are monsanto and the likes doing in nigeria monsanto and the likes have no business in nigeria and the biosafety bill should not be passed because it is merely a charade to get monsanto into the country ill tell you why two million people march against monsanto and not cell phone companies food and water are the most basic requirements for human life god in his wisdom made our sources of food renewable monsanto through its patent laws and systems seeks to own control and charge for what has been given to us freely this makes nigeria dependent on foreign biotech firms to feed so mr minister there is no confusion here this is what we stand against the fact that six out of the eight countries that make up the g8 have banned the cultivation of gm foods for consumption in their own countries but formed an alliance to promote and fund this initiative in our country is something every nigerian needs to ponder on our conclusion after extensive reading endless research a comparison of the facts put forth by the minister for agriculture the ministry and mosanto versus the plethora of same by mr rhodesvivour and the endless list of people he quoted we believe that the idiotic penchant of trying to go to space when a journey to oshodi is really what is needed that seems to be our new mantra is what is playing out here indeed nigeria should be able to feed itself and the minister should be commended for trying to achieve this objective however gmos are the last rung on the ladder to this objective as it has been in the developed countries at this point the government should focus on trying to achieve full mechanization of nigerian agriculture the provision of extension services to farmers must be increased to meet world standards and farmers have access to long term loans and the nigerian railway must be revamped to be the primary mode of transportation of produce from the farms to the cities and even to the ports for exports when the foregoing is achieved by government nigeria would be feeding herself independently and expanding our food exports without the need to resort to gmo we like

            "text": "This is the concluding part of the article on GMOs, you can read the first part here if you missed it lastweek. GMOs And Their Hazards To Our Future Health - Part I By Olalekan Anifowose\n\nWith All due respect, Mr Adesina’s response aside from being vague and empty has not addressed any concerns raised by my article. In playing politics with the Nigerian people, he has spoken about everything except the ELEPHANT in the room.\n\n“Nigeria does not have GMOs.”\n\nSir, WHAT IS MONSANTO DOING IN NIGERIA? In the month of May 2014, an article titled ‘‘Government okays introduction of 40 hybrid seeds in Nigeria” was published in the Guardian newspaper.  Another article titled “Monsanto to introduce 40 new seed varieties.”,  was also published and Monsanto’s vice president, Michael Frank was quoted saying that MONSANTO would focus on maize, soybean, cotton and oil-grape seed production in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the NABDA boss (Nigeria Biotechnology Development Agency), Nigeria already has three genetically engineered crops in confined field trial. He names them as BT cowpea in Zaria, the African bio-fortified sorghum also in Zaria and the Cassava plus at the National Root Crops Institute at Umudike, Abia State. The Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR) in Zaria in association with Monsanto and CSIRO in Australia have created Bt Cowpea using genes derived from the soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis  (which was provided by Monsanto) and have carried out field trials (Ezezika & Dall, 2012).\n\nMr Minister there is nothing conventional or natural about Monsanto Transgenic modifications, neither is there anything natural about inserting DNA from bacteria into cowpea. It is clear from these experiments and associations, that Nigerian agencies and institutes have become merely surrogates for experimentation on behalf of foreign/commercial interests.\n\n“All the seeds used by farmers in Nigeria are from conventional breeding, and we allow farmers to reuse their own seeds”\n\nIs that the Monsanto Model? There are so many case studies around the world that proves that this is not Monsanto’s model.  Prof. Iwu had this to say about the Monsanto Model.\n\n“One of the things they do and they do badly is that they will bring these things, they will give our farmers seeds for example and they will plant these seeds. Regardless of whether the seeds are safe or not you cannot replant the seeds the next year. You will go back and start buying from them and after a while there will be total dependency. And these things can be airborne and they can destroy our farms and so on.” Prof. Maurice Iwu, Professor of pharmacognosy at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN)\n\nNnimmo Bassey had this to say about the Monsanto model,\n\n“We cannot be force-fed by a savage biotech industry that seeks to colonise African seeds and food systems. The fact that GMOs will not feed the world is well studied and documented. See the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) report, for example. GMOs will enslave the world through the intellectual property rights that allows the biotech industry to patent their seeds, debars farmers from sharing or saving seeds and forces them to buy seeds every planting season. It seeks to overturn age long sustainable practices.” Nnimmo Bassey Nigerian environmentalist, Chair of Friends of the Earth International 2008-2012\n\nSo again I ask WHAT IS MONSANTO DOING IN NIGERIA?\n\n“Nigeria is putting in place bio safety laws to regulate use of modern biotechnology. Consumer and environmental safety are priority for us.”\n\nIfy Aniebo a molecular geneticist had this to say about the consumer and environmental safety of Monsanto GMO.\n\n“The few scientific researches done on the effects of these foods on humans have showed stunted growth, impaired immune systems, bleeding stomachs, abnormal and potentially precancerous cell growth in the intestines, impaired blood cell development, misshaped cell structures in the liver, pancreas and testicles, altered gene expression and cell metabolism, liver and kidney lesions, partially atrophied livers, inflamed kidneys, less developed organs, reduced digestive enzymes, higher blood sugar, inflamed lung tissue, increased death rates and higher offspring mortality as well.\n\nAfter GM soy was introduced in the UK, allergies from the product skyrocketed by 50 percent, and in the U.S. in the 1980s, a GM food supplement killed dozens and left five to 10 thousand others sick or disabled. Repeated use of seeds like Monsanto’s Roundup-Ready soybeans results in vicious new super-weeds that need far greater amounts of stronger herbicides to combat. Their toxic residues remain in crops that humans and animals then eat. Even small amounts of these toxins are endocrine disruptors that can affect human reproduction adversely. Most recently, tests showed the presence of the herbicide glyphosate, widely used with Monsanto’s herbicide-tolerant GM soybean and maize varieties, in samples of mothers’ breast milk in the United States.”. Ify Aniebo (BSc, MSc, MRes, MPH)is a molecular geneticist from Oxford University, with a master’s in public health She was also recognized by Nigeria’s President Goodluck Jonathan during the centenary celebrations as an inventor and innovator.\n\nAgain i ask what is Monsanto doing in Nigeria?\n\nThe minister presents the bio-safety law as an infrastructure that would look out for the interest of Nigerians by rigorously testing GMO products to ensure they are safe for consumption as well as the ecosystem. Here is what the Chairman, Senate committee on science and technology, Prof. Robert Boroffice, had to say on the Bio-Safety bill.\n\n“I can speak authoritatively that Mr. President will be anxious to enact a Bio-safety law, when he gets the passed bill before him, for the interest of the country, he will sign, So that Monsanto and other countries can come to Nigeria to assist us in boosting agricultural production not only in food but also in area of cotton, cowpea, maize, tomatoes.”\n\nSomehow before the bill has been passed it is clear Monsanto has Pre-qualified? Is that how a Bio-safety bill should work Mr. Minister? It is clear that this Bio-safety bill is nothing more than a gateway to guarantee Monsanto’s entry into Nigeria. This coupled with the minister’s framework (which is available online) makes it clear the focus is on big business as opposed to the safety and welfare of the Nigerian people.\n\n“We must not become misinformed by those that want Africa to remain backward, with misguided anti-technology views. “\n\nLet’s see how Monsanto GMO has fared in other parts of the world. In India for example, Monsanto crop failures are linked to the suicides of 300,000 cotton farmers.\n\nAccording to physicist and author Vandana Shiva, Monsanto’s contributions to a “suicide economy” in India, such as an increase in the price per kilogram of cotton seeds from 7 to 17,000 rupees. Shiva lists additional complications:\n\n“Indigenous cotton varieties can be intercropped with food crops. Monsanto’s Bt-cotton can only be grown as a monoculture. Indigenous cotton is rain fed. Bt-cotton needs irrigation. Indigenous varieties are pest resistant. Bt-cotton, even though promoted as resistant to the bollworm, has created new pests, and to control these new pests, farmers are using 13 times more pesticides than they were using prior to introduction of Bt-cotton. And finally, Monsanto sells its GMO seeds on fraudulent claims of yields of 1500/kg/year when farmers harvest 300-400 kg/year on an average.”\n\nAccording to HRH Prince Charles of England:\n\nThe crisis, branded the ‘GM Genocide’ by campaigners, was highlighted recently when Prince Charles claimed that the issue of GM had become a ‘global moral question’ – and the time had come to end its unstoppable march. He condemned ‘the truly appalling and tragic rate of small farmer suicides in India, stemming… from the failure of many Monsanto GM crop varieties’.\n\nIn Brazil, five million Brazilian farmers are locked in a lawsuit with US-based biotech giant Monsanto, suing for as much as 6.2 billion Euros. “Monsanto gets paid when it sell the seeds. The law gives producers the right to multiply the seeds they buy and nowhere in the world is there a requirement to pay (again). Producers are in effect paying a private tax on production,” Jane Berwanger, lawyer for the farmers in the latest installment of the legal battle erupting in South America, the Brazilian court has ruled in favor of the Brazilian farmers, saying Monsanto owes them at least US$2 billion.\n\nSo I ask for the umpteenth time Sir, what is Monsanto doing in Nigeria?\n\nMr Adesina uses a myopic and simplistic analogy to trivialize our health concerns in relation to risks associated with GM technology. He speaks of donkeys and planes, phones and match boxes.\n\nDr Adesina, Prof Borroface, have two million people marched against the airline industry or one Airline Company? Have 2 million people marched against the mobile phone industry? The answer is a resounding NO. Two million people all around the world in 436 cities have marched against Monsanto globally protesting the negative health effects and harm their technology does to human beings and the environment. Why? Because the risks associated with this technology far outweighs the benefits.\n\nBut Ill humour you, let’s say those two million people and everyone i have quoted in this article is anti-science and needs in your words “educating”, Are the 6 countries of the G8 anti-science too?\n\nIs the Technology Powerhouse – Japan anti-science? Yet they banned GMOS and have strong bio-safety laws PREVENTING and INHIBITING the importation of GMO products in to their country. France and Manufacturing powerhouse Germany banned Monsanto cultivation and GMO products. Italy banned cultivation of Monsanto and GM products. England does not allow cultivation of Monsanto crops and only allows GM products in to the country as animal feed and even this is under scrutiny. Lastly, the world super power Russia banned all Monsanto products as well as GM products entering the country.\n\nIn the words of the Russian Prime minister, Medvedev\n\n“If the Americans like to eat GMO products, let them eat it then. We don’t need to do that; we have enough space and opportunities to produce organic food,”\n\nWhile our Minister and Senator are trying to pass a bill to allow Monsanto to come in to Nigeria,\n\nRussia is passing a bill to treat producers of biotech crops from companies such as Monsanto, The Dow Chemical Company , and Syngenta as criminals, with fines comparable to terrorism. As co-author of the bill Kirill Cherkasov said,\n\n”When a terrorist act is committed, only several people are usually hurt. But GMOs may hurt dozens and hundreds. The consequences are much worse. And punishment should be proportionate to the crime.”\n\nSo the question remains and I ask again, WHAT IS MONSANTO DOING IN NIGERIA?\n\nMr. Minister, Mr. Senator, Do you have as robust an infrastructure as Russia, Japan or France? Do you plan to set it up overnight? Do you have the scientific infrastructure to monitor Monsanto?  Mr. Minister you clearly need to educate the leaders of all these great nations as well once you are done educating me. Do you have more scientists at your disposal than France, Germany or Japan? Or are we basing our policy on America and what America tells us is safe? A nation which is controlled by ‘Profit at any cost corporations’?\n\nA speech made by US Rep Dennis Kucinich on the house of congress floor:\n\n“In 1992 the Food and Drug Administration decided that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are the functional equivalent of conventional foods. They arrived at this decision without testing GMOs for allergenicity, toxicity, anti-biotic resistance and functional characteristics. As a result hundreds of millions of acres of GMO crops were planted in America without the knowledge or consent of the American people: no safety testing and no long term health studies. The FDA (Americas’s version of NAFDAC) has received over a million comments from citizens demanding labelling of GMOs. Ninety percent of Americans agree. So, why no labelling? I’ll give you one reason: The influence and the corruption of the political process by Monsanto. Monsanto has been a prime mover in GMO technology, a multi-million dollar GMO lobby here and a major political contributor.’\n\n“Unless Africa uses modern technologies, our farmers’ output will remain low and we will remain dependent on others to feed us”\n\nOn this I agree with Mr. Minister, So I ask, Sir have you fully mechanized the Nigerian Agriculture sector? Do farmers have access to funding in the form of soft loans? Of all the money purportedly set aside for the agricultural sector, how many farmers have ACTUALLY accessed those funds? How is Nigeria doing with regards to the Maputo declaration? You clearly have a reference for what optimum productivity should be… do Nigerian farmers get subsidized like their European or American counterparts? Do they? Yet according to the IMF, in its largest countries by agricultural output at Purchasing Power Parity, Nigeria is ranked No 5, second to the USA which is ranked No 4 and all this was achieved without machinery and without access to funds or subsidies like their American counterparts.\n\nClearly giving them all that is too much work, so you propose magic seeds? Nigeria is dependent on imports not only due to previous issues raised, but also the fact that we do not process our products e.g rice. Till today Nigeria a nation is boasting about $900million revenue from the export of raw cocoa. Raw Cocoa in the 21st century, Cocoa has made men fortunes since the 1800s yet we still export raw cocoa. Mars Inc made $30billion annual turnover and that is just one chocolate company. Ignoring all the byproducts of Cocoa processing surely it would make a lot more sense for Nigeria to at least process her cocoa?\n\nNigerian leadership has to evolve from its Fire brigade paradigm in which it favors Corporations and special interest to exploit the nation at the detriment of its people. Case in point, The Niger Delta people complained for years concerning the destruction of their land and their waters and they could not feed themselves. Leadership ignored their calls. Champions of their cause lost their lives. Nigeria behaved as though the oil was for Nigeria but the oil spill was for the Niger delta. It was only when these people after years of complaints took up guns that Nigerian leadership paid attention. Today we pay billions in amnesty every year. What would it have cost Nigeria to have listened back then? To have enforced oil companies to clean up and do the right thing as they do in their own countries? Would it not have been cheaper for Nigeria on the long run? We are paying this price in the North currently because leaders have put selfish interest above those of the Nigerian people.\n\nArgentina the poster child of Monsanto is currently experiencing what I just spoke of. Research released from communities around farms where Monsanto is implementing its technology showed an increase in risk for defects at birth due to exposure to pesticides in mothers. The specific defects included were limb reduction, urogenital anomalies, CNS defects, orofacial clefts, heart conditions, and ocular defects.\n\nSo again I ask WHAT ARE MONSANTO AND THE LIKES DOING IN NIGERIA?\n\nMonsanto and the likes have no business in Nigeria and the Bio-safety bill should not be passed because it is merely a charade to get Monsanto into the country. I’ll tell you why two million people march against Monsanto and not cell phone companies. Food and water are the most basic requirements for human life. God in his wisdom made our sources of food renewable. Monsanto through its patent laws and systems seeks to own, control and charge for what has been given to us freely. This makes Nigeria dependent on foreign bio-tech firms to feed. So Mr. Minister there is no confusion here, this is what we stand against. The fact that six out of the eight countries that make up the G8 have banned the cultivation of GM foods for consumption in their own countries but formed an alliance to promote and fund this initiative in our country is something every Nigerian needs to ponder on.”\n\nAfter extensive reading, endless research a comparison of the facts put forth by the Minister for Agriculture, the Ministry and Mosanto versus the plethora of same by Mr. Rhodes-Vivour and the endless list of people he quoted, we believe that the idiotic penchant of trying to go to space when a journey to Oshodi is really what is needed, that seems to be our new mantra is what is playing out here.\n\nIndeed, Nigeria should be able to feed itself and the minister should be commended for trying to achieve this objective. However, GMO’s are the last rung on the ladder to this objective, as it has been in the developed countries. At this point, the government should focus on trying to achieve full mechanization of Nigerian agriculture, the provision of extension services to farmers must be increased to meet world standards and farmers have access to long term loans and the Nigerian railway must be revamped to be the primary mode of transportation of produce from the farms to the cities and even to the ports for exports. When the foregoing is achieved by government, Nigeria would be feeding herself independently and expanding our food exports, without the need to resort to GMO.\n\nWe like to hear from you so kindly DROP A COMMENT HERE.

into it with the threat of losing up to 2 of their funding from medicaremedicaid if their flu shot rate among staff drops below 90 for those across the pond this is a worthy organisation to support as flu vaccines are not an effective way to eradicate the disease and this move is a violation of human rights thankfully some places offer a face mask as an option for those not wanting to have the

The insect pests are supposed to die after eating GM corn, but farmers are now forced to spray up to 3 rounds of insecticides per crop cycle to try to ward them off. The farmers are apparently demanding compensation for the cost of the spraying from 4 BT corn seed suppliers, namely Monsanto, Syngenta, Pioneer and Dow Agrosciences.\n\nBut the GM seed suppliers are blaming the farmers saying they warned them about planting only part of their corn fields. Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja farm lobby in Mato Grosso state, says the companies did not give clear instructions. He added, \"There are barely any non-GMO seeds available ... it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers.\"\n\nLast week, a division of Monsanto participated as \"part of the focus of a roundtable discussion…. in Washington DC, part of the White House Climate Data Initiative\". According to Monsanto's own blog, their collaborative efforts “will contribute to broader understandings and better inform decisions on investments and actions that will be required for the world’s food systems to be more resilient to climate change”. According to AG Professional, President Obama’s science advisor said: “Through his Climate Data Initiative, President Obama is calling for all hands on deck to unleash data and technology in ways that will make businesses and communities more resilient to climate change”. Monsanto is reported to have said they are committed to “sustainable food production”, so are we to assume by that that their innovative solutions won’t be including GMOs? We think not.\n\nIn the meantime, it seems Monsanto is increasingly marketing by stealth, reportedly influencing ‘mommy bloggers’ who can then shape public opinion on webpages, social media and Twitter feeds. We are informed that bloggers are being paid $150 to attend “an intimate and interactive panel” and three-hour brunch, and is inviting bloggers to tour Monsanto’s fields and research labs.\n\nIt’s been recently reported that a criminal complaint has been filed against the makers of Gardasil (cervical cancer vaccine) — Merck-Sanofi Pasteur Laboratories, as well as against Spanish National Health authority and regional health authorities of the La Rioja province. The complaint has been filed on behalf of a Spanish girl and her mother, for “injuries and disabilities” suffered by the girl “after the administration of Gardasil”, the controversial vaccine being marketed widely as ‘protection’ against cancers arising as a result of certain forms of Human Papilloma virus. Among the complaints, Merck-Sanofi Pasteur Laboratories is accused of “manipulating data and marketing Gardasil under false pretences”, while national and local health authorities “showed an absolute disregard for the health and well-being of young Spanish girls”. The complaint is reported to have added “when adverse reactions did occur, those who experienced them were treated with contempt leaving them in a state of helplessness”.\n\nIn other vaccine news, the authors of a US paper, which offered an explanation for the link between GlaxoSmithKline’s Pandemrix (Swine) flu vaccine and the sleepiness disorder narcolepsy, have retracted the article. The original research was published in Science Translational Medicine, in December 2013, but, according to the Nature News Blog, the authors “have been unable to repeat a key finding”. However a spokesperson for GlaxoSmithKline is reported to have said: “We continue to believe that the original scientific hypothesis remains a valid one that needs to be further explored”.",

            "text": "Machines lined up before harvesting soybeans at a farm in Tangara da Serra in Cuiaba, Brazil (Reuters / Paulo Whitaker)\n\nFive million Brazilian farmers are locked in a lawsuit with US-based biotech giant Monsanto, suing for as much as 6.2 billion euros. They say that the genetic-engineering company has been collecting royalties on crops it unfairly claims as its own.\n\nThe farmers claim that Monsanto unfairly collects exorbitant profits every year worldwide on royalties from “renewal” seed harvests. “Renewal” crops are those that have been planted using seed from the previous year’s harvest. While the practice of renewal farming is an ancient one, Monsanto disagrees, demanding royalties from any crop generation produced from its genetically-engineered seed. Because the engineered seed is patented, Monsanto not only charges an initial royalty on the sale of the crop produced, but a continuing 2 per cent royalty on every subsequent crop, even if the farmer is using a later generation of seed.\n\n“Monsanto gets paid when it sell the seeds. The law gives producers the right to multiply the seeds they buy and nowhere in the world is there a requirement to pay (again). Producers are in effect paying a private tax on production,” Jane Berwanger, lawyer for the farmers told the Associated Press reports.\n\nIn the latest installment of the legal battle erupting in South America, the Brazilian court has ruled in favor of the Brazilian farmers, saying Monsanto owes them at least US$2 billion paid since 2004. Monsanto, however, has appealed the decision and the case is ongoing.\n\nIn essence, Monsanto argues that once a farmer buys their seed, they have to pay the global bio-tech giant a yearly fee in perpetuity – with no way out.\n\nAt stake is Brazil’s highly profitable and ever growing soybean production. Last year, Brazil was the world’s second producer and exporter of soybean behind the United States, according to the AFP report. The crops can be used for anything from animal feed to bio fuel, and worldwide demand is growing.\n\nGenetically engineered soy first appeared illegally in Brazil in the 1990’s, smuggled in from neighboring Argentina. The Brazilian farmers found the seed attractive despite the ban in place from the Brazilian authorities because Monsanto had specifically designed the seed to be resistant to its own immensely powerful and popular herbicide Roundup.\n\nWhen used in tandem, the strong herbicide will kill the weeds while allowing the soy crops to grow unimpeded. After the ban was lifted, genetically modified seed flooded the Brazilian market, and now 85 per cent of the Brazilian soy crop is genetically-engineered. Soy has been extremely successful in Brazil, currently making up 26 per cent of the country’s farm exports last year and netting Brazil a total of $24.1 billion, according to AP. However, Brazil’s farmers were apparently unaware there would be a heavy price to pay.\n\nTo make a deal with Monsanto is to make a deal with a company that is one the most powerful and pervasive food giants in the world. It is the world’s number one seed developer, and its patented genes have been inserted into 95 per cent of all American soy, and 80 per cent of all American corn crops. Monsanto has repeatedly levied large damage suits against independent farmers that have unknowingly or unwittingly used their seed.\n\nAnd Monsanto’s reach goes far beyond agriculture.\n\nMonsanto is also the world’s largest manufacturer of synthetic bovine growth hormone, injected into cows in order to stimulate greater milk production. The widespread pressure by the company to use the chemical and the subsequent measures taken by Monsanto to suppress information regarding the potential health risks sparked uproar among American farmers.\n\nWhen dairy producers that did not use Monsanto’s products began labeling their products as “Hormone Free” or “Organic”, Monsanto slapped them with a lawsuit as recently as 2008, claiming the labels amounted to negative advertising against hormone-produced milk.\n\nDirector of corporate communications for Monsanto, Phil Angell, summed up Monsanto’s take on the issue in a report by food author Michael Pollan for New York Times Magazine in 1998: “Monsanto should not have to vouch for the safety of biotech food. Our interest is in selling as much of it as possible. Assuring its safety is FDA’s job.”",

            "text": "August 3, 2012 — The number of individuals sickened by a novel swine influenza virus since July 2011 has surged to 29, with 12 new cases reported this week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced today.\n\nDirect or indirect contact with pigs explains how most of the 29 individuals, predominantly children, caught the virus. However, the CDC has identified a few cases of human-to-human transmission, and the agency is closely monitoring the virus to see whether it mutates into a version more easily spread among humans. A study published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in February reported that the virus has \"pandemic potential\" among humans.\n\nJust in case, the agency has developed a pilot vaccine against the novel virus that is scheduled for clinical trials later this year, CDC epidemiologist Joseph Bresee, MD, said in a press briefing today.\n\nOf the 12 swine influenza cases from this week, 10 involved patients who had been exposed to pigs at a county fair in Butler County, Ohio, 1 involved a patient had been exposed to swine at a county fair in Indiana, and 1 involved a farmer in Hawaii who worked with pigs. None of the 12 patients were hospitalized.\n\nThese 12 cases number among 16 reported during the last 3 weeks.\n\n\"We want to understand why we're seeing more cases than we have in the past,\" said Dr. Bresee. Possible explanations include a change in the virus' genetic makeup, more human interaction with sick pigs during summer county fairs, or simply an intensified effort by public health authorities to look for this virus.\n\nThe virus could be circulating among humans more widely than the reported cases suggest, Dr. Bresee noted. \"If you have 16 cases in the last 3 weeks, you probably have more cases that weren't reported.\n\n\"We expect that additional cases will be identified,\" he added. \"We also expect some of the cases might be severe.\"\n\nNovel Swine Influenza Has Gene From Human Pandemic Virus\n\nThe novel swine influenza virus leaves patients as sick as if they had caught the seasonal influenza virus. \"Based on clinical symptoms alone, it's difficult or impossible to tell them apart,\" said Dr. Bresee. Accordingly, clinicians need to have a specimen tested by the CDC or a state health department to make the call.\n\nAll of the 29 patients infected since last year recovered. Only 3 required hospitalization, and they had underlying high-risk conditions.\n\nAdults may have some preexisting immunity to the novel virus, which has hit children the hardest, Dr. Bresee said.\n\nThe novel swine influenza virus is designated A(H3N2)v, with the \"v\" standing for variant. What produces the variance is an \"M\" gene from the pandemic 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus among humans that codes for matrix proteins in the viral shell. Experts say that the pandemic virus has found its way into the nation's pig herds, leading to the alteration of the A(H3N2) virus that circulates among these animals.\n\nDr. Bresee said the M gene from the human pandemic virus is related to viral replication and release, and its presence in the swine influenza A(H3N2)v virus \"may confer human transferability.\"\n\nThere also is an A(H3N2) virus that normally circulates among humans, and this year's seasonal influenza vaccine, as in past years, is formulated to guard against it. However, Dr. Bresee said that the swine influenza A(H3N2)v virus is different enough from the human kind to make it impervious to the seasonal vaccine — hence the need to develop a separate vaccine.\n\nIn the meantime, the CDC is advising individuals who may get up close and personal with pigs at county fairs and farms to take precautions, which include:\n\nIn addition, because they are at higher risk from serious complications of influenza, children younger than 5 years, adults aged 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain chronic illnesses such as asthma or heart disease should consider avoiding pigs altogether.\n\nDr. Bresee said he expects that the antivirals oseltamivir (Tamiflu, Genentech) and zanamivir (Relenza, GlaxoSmithKline), which are prescribed for seasonal influenza, also will effectively treat A(H3N2)v influenza.\n\nMore information about the swine influenza A(H3N2)v virus is available on the CDC's Web site.",

within the last week monsanto is widely recognized as the most hated and most evil corporation on the planet wrote mike adams keeper of the enormously popular naturalnews site thats standard fare for mr adams who calls himself the health ranger monsanto holds 90 of gmo market share so for good reason its a big fat target for gmo critics but last week adams brushed up against godwins law — comparing monsanto to ig farben the chemical conglomerate run by nazi collaborators that used jewish prisoners as human guinea pigs in horrific medical experiments just as history needed to record the names and deeds of nazi war criminals he wrote so too must all those collaborators who are promoting the death and destruction caused by gmos be named for the historical record then adams went a step further and suggested it is the moral right — and even the obligation — of human beings everywhere to actively plan and carry out the killing of those engaged in heinous crimes against humanity later adams updated his post to put quotation marks around that statement attributing it to well its not really clear the more uhh measured critics of gmos were left slackjawed even if you think the science behind gmos is sound theres another problem their mere existence is a gross violation of private property rights the wind routinely blows monsantos gmo seeds onto the property of farmers trying to grow nongmo crops thats bad enough but rather than compensate those farmers for the contamination monsanto turns around and sues them for patent infringement over the last decade the company dragged 410 farmers from 27 states into court last year the us supreme court issued a unanimous opinion in favor of monsanto joel salatin the organic farmer from virginia who gained a following through the documentary food inc makes a splendid analogy can you imagine somebody in a community with a male dog who let him loose from his leash and he went through the community and bred 10 of his neighbors female species can you imagine all those 10 female species owners going to the guy that released his male dog and paying him for genetic material now evidence is emerging that gmo crops dont even accomplish what theyre supposed to this week farmers in brazil said their gmo corn is no longer resistant to pests they have to buy pesticides they thought they wouldnt need the caterpillars should die if they eat the corn but since they didnt die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reals 54 per hectare at a time that corn prices are terrible says ricardo tomczyk president of the aprosoja farm lobby in mato grosso state the farmers are seeking compensation from monsanto and three other gmo seedmakers we hope theyre not holding their breath ive already gone through my own fridge and pantry to protect my wife and four kids says the aforementioned doug hill — bringing us back to the core issue doug and his team have pored over those 44000 pages of internal fda memos his conclusion the list of foods that can potentially be dangerous to your health is much longer than you can probably imagine if your goal is to live a long healthy and vigorous life you owe it to yourself and your loved ones to check out dougs research summary it really is a case of what you dont know can kill you so give it a look right now stocks are selling off hard this morning well by recent standards anyway barring a miraculous recovery it looks as if the sp 500 will notch its second 1 daily decline since midapril at 1941 the index is down 24 from its alltime high one week ago today the correction our trading desk has been eyeing for lo these many weeks might be underway hot money isnt flowing into gold the midas metal is down about 10 to 1285 crude its tumbled below 99 treasuries theyre flat the only beneficiary today appears to be the greenback the admittedly flawed dollar index is up to 814 — a level not seen since last september mainstream financial media cant make up their minds whats to blame fed rate policy says marketwatch europe deflation fears avers cnbc the idea an epic rally is simply due for a rest is too radical for them to contemplate heh well what about the fed yesterday its open market committee opted to cut back its bond purchases another 10 billion per month as our old friend the tapir shows us the fed has trimmed in 10 billion increments at every meeting since last december but the rest of the fed statement — at 840 words near a record for verbosity — left much to the imagination specifically how soon the fed funds rate might finally start being raised from the nearzero levels where theyve sat since december 2008 markets love certainty and right now there is too much uncertainty about the feds trigger points for raising rates says kristina hooper a strategist at allianz global instead of looking at one number such as the unemployment rate the fed is looking at a mosaic of data points investors are unsure what the fed would consider a tolerable level of higher inflation fat lot of good the feds communication policy and forward guidance are doing eh funny thing is nobody seems much worried about argentinas second default in 13 years argentina defaulted on 81 billion in bonds in december 2001 when the infamous corralito was grafted onto argentine citizens and the peso effectively devalued 75 in the end the international monetary fund agreed to let the government pay only the interest owed but along the way a handful of hedge fund owners — notably paul singer of elliott management — bought some of the bonds for pennies on the dollar then they dragged the argentine government into courts all over the world betting someone would order the argentines to pay in full that included two courts in the us the us judges told singer to take a hike how dare you waste valuable taxpayer resources on a bonehead case like this you took your chances with a deadbeat government and it didnt work out boo freakin hoo just kidding the judges ruled in the hedgies favor and the us supreme court turned away argentinas appeal mediators tried up until the last minute to broker a deal but with no luck as of yesterday afternoon argentina is once again in default to the yawns of the elite media absolutely nothing is riding on an argentinas default sniffs heidi moore in the guardian the entire conflict is composed of absurdities au contraire tweets our friend jim rickards author of the death of money and so we watch no dire consequences yet but were on the case i just had to add my nickel to the conversation about the morality of investing in certain companies or industries a reader writes while some decisions about what to avoid are straightforward others are less so for example the reader yesterday said fracking is bad and therefore he doesnt put his investment money in fracking even though he presumed he could have made significant profits by doing so his case against fracking is thin at best he thinks that it wastes good water and that someday well find that there is a better and safer way to obtain these hydrocarbons the logical extension of this kind of thinking would have avoided all oilgas recovery and we would all still be living in the whale oil world im sure he wouldnt have invested in whale oil either if he was serious and consistent he would not only avoid investing in these immoral things but he would not use the products that result from these technologies and businesses i would suggest he try to live in california without using hydrocarbon products if he wants to feel really good about himself good luck with that todays environmentalists moralists are quick to embrace the moral imperative of avoidingstopping what by most rational measures would be progress they seem to need to feel superior to the rest of us by opposing this progress in my opinion they are little more than spoiled rich children who can afford to look down their noses at those they consider less moral than they they need to be held to their own standards and shown to be the hypocrites that they usually are regarding your comments yesterday about potential development of the leviathan gas field do any of us think that what is going on in the eastern ukraine is about anything other than the development or prevention thereof of the shale gas in eastern ukraine lem me see 1 shell and bp did a joint venture with a ukrainian outfit to develop it with jokin joe bidens son on the board of said ukrainian outfit 2 if that ukrainian gas field gets developed it will cut into russias gas sales to europe andor lower the price of the gas russia sells to europe 3 vlad does not want 2 to happen as it would hurt his development of the russian military andor his alleged popularity in russia is it at all hard to connect the above dots the 5 not at all at this point we just hope the new cold war doesnt turn hot best regards dave gonigam the 5 min forecast ps

            "text": "There’s no such thing as a wild cow, asserts the celebrity astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.\n\nWe’ll back up a bit: Mr. Tyson has seen fit to weigh in on the issue of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) — foods whose DNA has been altered by genetic engineering to produce their own pesticides or withstand megadoses of herbicides.\n\nAs you can see, most of America’s corn and soybeans now come from GMO seeds. On this chart, HT means the crop is “herbicide tolerant”; BT means it’s insect resistant.\n\nGMOs have recently come on the radar of our colleague Doug Hill, director of the Laissez Faire Club. His conclusion: “These genetically modified crops may be extremely dangerous to our families. Most Americans today are eating this food because they are unaware of the risks.\n\nThey do it because government agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration, have said these genetically modified crops are safe.”\n\n“But the FDA,” Doug goes on, “has actually never conducted any studies on humans to prove this food is safe,” Indeed, Doug and his research team discovered 44,000 pages of memos from the FDA showing “its own scientists agreed that GMOs could create unpredictable, unsafe, and hard-to-detect allergens, toxins, diseases, and nutritional problems.”\n\n“I’m amazed how much rejection genetically modified foods are receiving from the public,” Tyson tells a French interviewer. “It smacks of the fear factor that exists at every new emergent science…\n\n“What most people don’t know, but they should, is that practically every food you buy in a store — for consumption by humans — is genetically modified food,” Tyson continues. “There are no wild, seedless watermelons. There’s no wild cows.”\n\nHmmm… Tyson seems to think there’s no difference between modifying plants and animals through traditional breeding… and genetic modification techniques that involve, for instance, inserting genes from different species.\n\nWhatever. We’re more intrigued by why Tyson chose to pipe up now: “Global warming” and evolution are more his beat. But we suspect it might have something to do with an Internet furor that exploded within the last week…\n\n“Monsanto is widely recognized as the most hated and most evil corporation on the planet,” wrote Mike Adams, keeper of the enormously popular NaturalNews site.\n\nThat’s standard fare for Mr. Adams, who calls himself the “Health Ranger.” Monsanto holds 90% of GMO market share, so for good reason it’s a big, fat target for GMO critics. But last week Adams brushed up against Godwin’s law — comparing Monsanto to IG Farben, the “chemical conglomerate run by Nazi collaborators” that “used Jewish prisoners as human guinea pigs in horrific medical experiments…\n\n“Just as history needed to record the names and deeds of Nazi war criminals,” he wrote, “so too must all those collaborators who are promoting the death and destruction caused by GMOs be named for the historical record.”\n\nThen Adams went a step further and suggested, “It is the moral right — and even the obligation — of human beings everywhere to actively plan and carry out the killing of those engaged in heinous crimes against humanity.”\n\nLater, Adams updated his post to put quotation marks around that statement, attributing it to… well, it’s not really clear.\n\nThe more, uhh, measured critics of GMOs were left slack-jawed…\n\nEven if you think the science behind GMOs is sound, there’s another problem: Their mere existence is a gross violation of private property rights.\n\nThe wind routinely blows Monsanto’s GMO seeds onto the property of farmers trying to grow non-GMO crops.

Well, by recent standards anyway.\n\nBarring a miraculous recovery, it looks as if the S&P 500 will notch its second 1% daily decline since mid-April. At 1,941, the index is down 2.4% from its all-time high one week ago today. The correction our trading desk has been eyeing for lo these many weeks might be underway.\n\nHot money isn’t flowing into gold; the Midas metal is down about $10, to $1,285. Crude? It’s tumbled below $99. Treasuries? They’re flat. The only beneficiary today appears to be the greenback. The (admittedly flawed) dollar index is up to 81.4 — a level not seen since last September.\n\nMainstream financial media can’t make up their minds what’s to blame: “Fed rate policy,” says MarketWatch. “Europe deflation fears,” avers CNBC.\n\nThe idea an epic rally is simply due for a rest is too radical for them to contemplate. Heh…\n\nWell, what about the Fed? Yesterday, its Open Market Committee opted to cut back its bond purchases another $10 billion per month.

No dire consequences yet, but we’re on the case.\n\n“I just had to add my nickel to the conversation about the ‘morality’ of investing in certain companies or industries,” a reader writes.\n\n“While some decisions about what to avoid are straightforward, others are less so.

If he was serious and consistent, he would not only avoid investing in these ‘immoral’ things, but he would not use the products that result from these technologies and businesses.

Shell and BP did a joint venture with a Ukrainian outfit to develop it (with Jokin’ Joe Biden’s son on the board of said Ukrainian outfit).\n\n2. If that Ukrainian gas field gets developed, it will cut into Russia’s gas sales to Europe and/or lower the price of the gas Russia sells to Europe.\n\n3. Vlad does NOT want (2) to happen, as it would hurt his development of the Russian military and/or his (alleged) popularity in Russia.\n\n“Is it at all hard to connect the above dots?”\n\nThe 5: Not at all. At this point, we just hope the new cold war doesn’t turn hot.\n\nP.S. Congratulations to readers of Real Wealth Trader, who are pulling in a 200% gain in a little over two months today.

            "text": "Brazilian corn farmers say genetically modified (GM) crops are no more resistant to tropical bugs, according to media reports. As a result, farmers are demanding compensation from four major manufacturers of BT corn seeds —Monsanto, DuPont, Syngenta, and Dow companies —for their losses.\n\nThe Association of Soybean and Corn Producers of the Mato Grosso region (Aprosoja-MT), in a press release, said farmers first noticed in March that their GM corn crops were less resistant to the destructive caterpillars that Bt corn is supposed to protect against. In turn, farmers were forced to apply extra coats of insecticides, leading to additional environmental and financial costs.\n\n“The caterpillars should die if they eat the corn, but since they did not die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reals ($54) per hectare ... at a time that corn prices are terrible,” said Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja.\n\nSeed companies, however, told Reuters they had warned farmers to plant part of their corn fields with conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to GM seeds.\n\n Dow Agrosciences, a division of Dow Chemical Co, has programmes in Brazil to help corn farmers develop “an integrated pest management system that includes, among other things, the cultivation of refuge areas,” it told the news agency in an email. DuPont and Monsanto Co said they had not received any formal notification from Aprosoja.\n\nThe problem that Brazil is facing of bugs getting resistant to GM crops is becoming increasingly common. Earlier this year, scientists in the US confirmed that corn-destroying rootworms had evolved to be resistant to the GM corn seeds engineered to kill them.\n\nThere was another development related to GM crops. China called for an emergency meeting on Wednesday after it was reported that GM rice was being illegally sold in a supermarket in China’s Hubei province. Despite having a strict policy on GM crops, illegal cultivation and sale of GM crops is becoming common in China, said media reports. Media quoted Chinese agriculture ministry statement that said that there would be zero tolerance towards those who grow or sell GM crops.",

            "text": "The end of the war in Iraq demonstrates the success, and the ambiguous nature of that success, that has characterized much of President Barack Obama’s foreign policy. In some respects, the Obama administration has several substantial foreign policy accomplishments to which it can point on the eve of an election year. The capture and killing of Osama Bin Laden and winding down the war in Iraq are the most visible, but the administration has also responded effectively to some global events in places like North Africa and Russia wisely.\n\nFor example, the administration has avoided making too many strong statements about the current situation in Russia which would strengthen Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s narrative that the problem in Russia is excessive intervention by the American government, rather than excessive authoritarianism and election fraud by the Russian government. Similarly, although the Obama administration was, at times, frustratingly silent during the early days of the protests in Egypt, and displayed far more confidence than was deserved in the interest various North African autocrats held in reforming, the outcomes have been positive. In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak resigned; and in Libya, Moammar Gaddafi was forced from office.\n\nThe problem the Obama administration faces, both politically and substantively, is that while it has numerous foreign policy accomplishments to which it can point, the whole to which they add up remains less than the sum of its parts. For example, while the killing of Bin Laden is something about which Americans are rightfully happy, and the conclusion of the military effort in Iraq, while almost a decade late and a few trillion dollars short, is also a good thing for the U.S., the overall impact these things have on American security, stability in South Asia or the Middle East or other related issues is less clear.\n\nThis is partially due to the vexing nature of these problems. The war in Iraq, for example, had created a range of problems that could not be easily solved by the U.S. beginning in 2009. Similarly, killing Bin Laden was never on its own going to eliminate the threat of Jihadist terror, but there are other factors to be considered as well. The Obama administration’s occasionally cautious approach to foreign policy necessitates downplaying both expectations and accomplishments. Thus, the absence of sweeping statements and ambitious goals can be frustrating to American audiences, but often lead to better outcomes.\n\nOn the other hand, this unwillingness to set ambitious or creative goals has contributed to the administration’s inability to consider bolder decisions and approaches. The killing of Bin Laden, for example, does not change the situation in Afghanistan where Obama has talked himself, and the country, into a war that continues with no clear end, or even goals, in sight. Similarly, the administration’s commitment to a U.S. position as a global hegemon spending billions of dollars it no longer has in this endeavor reflects a commitment to conventional, and increasingly unsustainable approaches to foreign policy.\n\nIn this context, the accomplishments of the Obama administration will never seem satisfactory, either to opponents of the administration who seek out any opportunity to criticize the president, but more significantly, to observers who cannot help but note the distressing state of international affairs despite several high profile successes by the administration.\n\nFor Obama to craft a foreign policy that sews together his impressive accomplishments in a way that more concretely makes the U.S. stronger and more secure, the administration will have to demonstrate a willingness to move away from the received Washington wisdom and the logic of the foreign policy bureaucracy, and develop an approach to foreign policy that reflects the new fiscal realities at home and multi-lateral nature of the world today. This will not be easy, but if the U.S. does not do this, its role in the world will be reduced anyway, but definitively not on America’s terms.",

Researchers in Iowa found significant damage from rootworms in corn fields last year.\n\nIn Brazil, the main corn culprit is Spodoptera frugiperda, also known as the corn leafworm or southern grassworm.\n\nSeed companies say they warned Brazilian farmers to plant part of their corn fields with conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to GMO seeds.\n\nDow Agrosciences, a division of Dow Chemical Company, has programs in Brazil to help corn farmers develop “an integrated pest management system that includes, among other things, the cultivation of refuge areas,” it said in an email.\n\nAnother company, DuPont, said it had not received any formal notification from Aprosoja. The company’s Pioneer brand has been working with producers to extend the durability of its seed technology and improve efficiency since Spodoptera worms were found to have developed resistance to the Cry1F protein, it said in a statement.\n\nThe other two companies, Monsanto Co and Syngenta AG did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nTomczyk, who also spoke for Brazilian farmers during a dispute over seed royalty payments to Monsanto that ended last year, said Aprosoja encouraged the planting of refuge areas.

genetically engineered seedsgets away with not having to label its products all you have to do is follow the trail of money leading from their coffers into the pockets and campaign funds of wellplaced politicians and regulators according to opensecretsorg 1 monsanto basically lives at the doorsteps of legislators in washington where it spent 53 million last year lobbying the nations lawmakers and has already spent 14 million in the first three months of this year needless to say they can afford it according to opensecretsorg monsanto had an annual revenue of 118 billion last year so a 53 million lobbying investment is far less than one percent of one percent of their revenues the influence theyre trying to buy doesnt stop in congress though monsantos legislative agenda also includes the us department of agriculture usda the food and drug administration fda and the environmental protection agency epa all of which have a say in whether or not you get to know whether the food youre eating has been genetically engineered can you trust a system powered by lobbying the power of monsanto can be seen through its contributions to rep frank d lucas whos received the most money so far from monsanto lucas just happens to be chairman of the house agriculture committee through which every farmrelated piece of legislation must pass but hes certainly not the only one wheel getting greased by this biotech giant according to opensecretsorg so far this election cycle monsantos pac has given 77500 to 17 members of the house agriculture committee or their leadership pacs monsantos interests in washington are diverse it lobbied bills ranging from the american research and competitiveness act of 2011 2 which would extend tax credits for companies doing research to several bills that would change the way the department of homeland security handles security at chemical facilities chemicals being a big part of monsantos product portfolio another upcoming matter of great interest to monsanto the new farm bill an omnibus piece of legislation that sets the nations agricultural policy and deals with nearly every aspect of the countrys farming and food industries the current bill expires in 2013 when it went through congress monsanto filed more lobbying reports on it than any other organization the process of piecing together a new proposal is already well under way such lobbying efforts can and do have a tremendous impact on the lives and health of every american not to mention the environment it directly impacts the food you end up with on your plate and whether or not youre allowed to know whats in the food you eat to begin with monsanto and other biotech companies involved with genetic engineering of crop seeds are currently fighting tooth and nail to prevent labeling of genetically engineered foods knowing full well that such a label has the potential to destroy their burgeoning industry why monsanto always wins last year monsanto lobbied congress and the us department of agriculture concerning regulations that would affect genetically engineered crops such as the companys roundup ready soybeans and alfalfa as a result genetically engineered alfalfa was deregulated despite strong opposition from the organic industry and massive public outcry an interesting article from last year by mike ludwig titled why monsanto always wins sheds light on the shady approval process of genetically engineered crops 3 according to ludwig theres evidence of cooperation between federal regulators and the biotech industry that crosses the line of acceptable involvement during the regulatory review he also cites bill freese a policy analyst with cfs who told truthout that the approval process for controversial genetically engineered ge crops like roundup ready alfalfa is basically a sham designed to increase consumer confidence in the controversial ge crops and that in his years of battling against biotech he cant remember a single case when regulators failed to eventually grant approval of a ge crop to get an idea of just how broad and deep monsantos reach is take a look at the following chart over the years this biotech giant has successfully infiltrated an ever increasing number of highlevel federal regulatory positions in the us government many of which are positions meant to protect your food safety crazy patent laws prevent independent researchers from studying ge hazards to give you another example of how monsanto has been able to carefully position itself and its wares into a nearinvincible position consider this the reason why genetically engineered food hazards have never been studied beyond 30 days nor are currently being studied is because the corporations controlling the patented seeds such as monsanto are allowed to prevent independent studies per current patent laws thats right genetically engineered foods are patented inventions protected under copyright and proprietary information laws and the corporations controlling the seeds only allow them to be studied under very limited conditions and rarely if ever do they permit them to be studied for safety by anyone but the usda—which conveniently has not yet seen the need to conduct rigorous longterm safety studies on genetically engineered foods 4 how monsanto is now positioned to potentially decimate africa monsantos political influence clearly reaches far beyond our us borders most recently in an effort to end hunger in africa the obama administration drafted some of the worlds largest food and finance companies to invest in projects all over the continent 5 much of the 3 billion effort will go toward developing seeds and fertilizers and building silos for storage to do this the president has rounded up the usual suspects which includes monsanto however unlike the us some donor countries are insisting that their money be spent on traditional food handouts instead of genetically engineered monoculture such as that offered by tanseed a tanzanian seed company that will spend 11 million buying certified seed to be sold in little packets to small farmers still the evidence tells us genetically engineered crops can not coexist with organic or conventional crops they usually end up contaminating nearby fields turning those farmers into patentinfringing criminals in the process—a scenario no farmer on any continent could ever have imagined a couple of decades ago another project seeking to establish genetically engineered crops in africa is the alliance for a green revolution in africa agra through this alliance heavyweights like monsanto and other biotech companies along with the gates foundation are foolishly promoting ge crops as the answer to africas hunger problem but donating patented seeds which takes away the farmers sovereignty is not the way to save the thirdworld poor the gates foundation has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to agra and in 2006 robert horsch was hired for the project horsch was a monsanto executive for 25 years in a nutshell the project may be sold under the banner of altruism and sustainability but in reality its anything but its just a multibillion dollar enterprise to transform africa into a gecropfriendly continent in the end such humanitarian efforts are doomed to fail while allowing big biotech to make obscene profits at the poors expense african farmers will likely encounter the same problems as those in india where farmers growing genetically engineered crops have been committing suicide due to financial hardships at a rate of one farmer taking his own life every 30 minutes brazilian farmers sue monsanto for unfair and exorbitant profits a recent lawsuit against monsanto by brazilian farmers also highlights the harsh economic realities for farmers who take up growing genetically engineered crops according to a recent rt news article 6 five million brazilian farmers are locked in a lawsuit with usbased biotech giant monsanto suing for as much as 62 billion euros the farmers claim that monsanto unfairly collects exorbitant profits every year worldwide on royalties from renewal seed harvests renewal crops are those that have been planted using seed from the previous years harvest while the practice of renewal farming is an ancient one monsanto disagrees demanding royalties from any crop generation produced from its geneticallyengineered seed because the engineered seed is patented monsanto not only charges an initial royalty on the sale of the crop produced but a continuing 2 per cent royalty on every subsequent crop even if the farmer is using a later generation of seed monsanto gets paid when it sell the seeds the law gives producers the right to multiply the seeds they buy and nowhere in the world is there a requirement to pay again producers are in effect paying a private tax on production jane berwanger lawyer for the farmers told the associated press reports in the latest installment of the legal battle erupting in south america the brazilian court has ruled in favor of the brazilian farmers saying monsanto owes them at least us2 billion paid since 2004 monsanto however has appealed the decision and the case is ongoing in essence monsanto argues that once a farmer buys their seed they have to pay the global biotech giant a yearly fee in perpetuity – with no way out why we need labeling of genetically engineered foods in the us labeling genetically engineered foods is likely the best shot we have at circumventing monsantos powergrabbing ways and stopping the unchecked proliferation of genetically engineered foods this is why we strongly support state initiatives such as californias 2012 ballot initiative to require genetically engineered foods sold in the state to be labeled this is a powerful strategy that could have the impact of a national law why because large food companies are unlikely to have dual labeling one for california and another for the rest of the country it would be very expensive not to mention a logistical and pr nightmare to avoid the dual labeling many would likely opt to ditch genetically engineered ingredients from their products entirely especially if the new label would be the equivalent of a skull and crossbones labeland thats exactly what monsanto fears gmo labeling will be heres a direct quote from the president of a monsanto subsidiary if you put a label on genetically engineered food you might as well put a skull and crossbones on it – norman braksick president of asgrow seed co a monsanto subsidiary kansas city star march 7 1994 this is why supporting this initiative is so important as victory in california will likely eliminate most genetically engineered foods from the rest of the us as well powerful confirmation of this belief occurred earlier this year when both cocacola company and pepsico inc chose to alter one of their soda ingredients as a result of californias labeling requirements for carcinogens 7 this is a perfect example of the national impact a california ge labeling requirement can and no doubt will have while california is the only state requiring the label to state that the product contains the offending ingredient these companies are switching their formula for the entire us market rather than have two different labels cocacola co and pepsico inc are changing the way they make the caramel coloring used in their sodas as a result of a california law that mandates drinks containing a certain level of carcinogens bear a cancer warning label the companies said the changes will be expanded nationally to streamline their manufacturing processes theyve already been made for drinks sold in california aaem recommends gmo free diet as you may recall two years ago the american academy of environmental medicine aaem called on all physicians to prescribe diets without genetically engineered foods to all patients 10 but youd be hardpressed to find a doctor who is aware of andor actually follows this recommendation at that time the aaem called for a moratorium on genetically engineered foods longterm independent studies and labeling stating several animal studies indicate serious health risks associated with gm food including infertility immune problems accelerated aging insulin regulation and changes in major organs and the gastrointestinal system there is more than a casual association between genetically modified foods and adverse health effects there is causation learn more about genetically engineered foods due to lack of labeling many americans are still unfamiliar with what genetically engineered foods are we have a plan to change that and i urge you to participate and to continue learning more about genetically engineered foods and helping your friends and family do the same your best strategy is to simply buy usda 100 organic products whenever possible as these do not permit genetically engineered ingredients or buy whole fresh produce and meat from local farmers the majority of the genetically engineered organisms gmos youre exposed to are via processed foods so by cooking from scratch with whole foods you can be sure youre not inadvertently consuming something laced with altered ingredients when you do purchase processed food avoid products containing anything related to corn or soy that are not usda certified to be 100 percent organic as any foods containing these two nonorganic ingredients are almost guaranteed to contain genetically engineered ingredients as well as toxic herbicide residues to learn more about genetically engineered foods i highly recommend perusing the many videos and lectures available on the irt site please continue supporting californias ballot initiative to label gmos the california right to know genetically engineered food act 11 has already been submitted to the state attorney general the next step is the campaigning remember if california can get the law passed in november its going to have the same impact as national law for the reasons i mentioned earlier its going to be an enormous battle as the biotech industry will outspend us by 100 to 1 if not more for their propaganda so needless to say the campaign needs funds if you have the ability i strongly encourage you to make a donation i urge you to get involved and help in any way you can be assured that what happens in california will affect the remainder of the us states so please support this important state initiative even if you do not live there if you live in california and want to get involved

            "text": "If you've ever wondered how Monsanto?a company that admits it wants to own the world's food supply through its patented genetically engineered seeds?gets away with not having to label its products, all you have to do is follow the trail of money leading from their coffers into the pockets and campaign funds of well-placed politicians and regulators. According to OpenSecrets.org1, Monsanto basically lives at the doorsteps of legislators in Washington, where it spent $5.3 million last year lobbying the nation's lawmakers, and has already spent $1.4 million in the first three months of this year. Needless to say, they can afford it. According to OpenSecrets.org, Monsanto had an annual revenue of $11.8 billion last year, so a $5.3 million lobbying investment is far less than one percent of one percent of their revenues. The influence they're trying to buy doesn't stop in Congress, though. Monsanto's legislative agenda also includes the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); all of which have a say in whether or not you get to know whether the food you're eating has been genetically engineered.\n\nThe power of Monsanto can be seen through its contributions to Rep. Frank D. Lucas, who's received the most money so far from Monsanto. Lucas just happens to be chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, through which every farm-related piece of legislation must pass. But he's certainly not the only one wheel getting greased by this biotech giant. \"'...So far this election cycle, Monsanto's PAC has given $77,500 to 17 members of the House agriculture committee, or their leadership PACs.'\" ...Monsanto's interests in Washington are diverse. It lobbied bills ranging from the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 20112, which would extend tax credits for companies doing research, to several bills that would change the way the Department of Homeland Security handles security at chemical facilities -- chemicals being a big part of Monsanto's product portfolio. ... Another upcoming matter of great interest to Monsanto: the new farm bill, an omnibus piece of legislation that sets the nation's agricultural policy and deals with nearly every aspect of the country's farming and food industries. The current bill expires in 2013; when it went through Congress, Monsanto filed more lobbying reports on it than any other organization. The process of piecing together a new proposal is already well under way.\" Such lobbying efforts can, and do, have a tremendous impact on the lives and health of every American, not to mention the environment. It directly impacts the food you end up with on your plate, and whether or not you're allowed to know what's in the food you eat to begin with. Monsanto and other biotech companies involved with genetic engineering of crop seeds are currently fighting tooth and nail to prevent labeling of genetically engineered foods, knowing full well that such a label has the potential to destroy their burgeoning industry.\n\nLast year, Monsanto lobbied Congress and the U.S. Department of Agriculture concerning regulations that would affect genetically engineered crops such as the company's Roundup Ready soybeans and alfalfa. As a result, genetically engineered alfalfa was deregulated, despite strong opposition from the organic industry and massive public outcry. An interesting article from last year by Mike Ludwig, titled \"Why Monsanto Always Wins,\" sheds light on the shady approval process of genetically engineered crops3. According to Ludwig, there's evidence of \"cooperation\" between federal regulators and the biotech industry that crosses the line of acceptable involvement during the regulatory review. He also cites Bill Freese, a policy analyst with CFS, who told Truthout that \"the approval process for controversial genetically engineered (GE) crops like Roundup Ready alfalfa is basically a 'sham' designed to increase consumer confidence in the controversial GE crops,\" and that in his years of battling against biotech, \"he can't remember a single case when regulators failed to eventually grant approval of a GE crop.\" To get an idea of just how broad and deep Monsanto's reach is, take a look at the following chart. Over the years, this biotech giant has successfully infiltrated an ever increasing number of high-level federal regulatory positions in the U.S. government; many of which are positions meant to protect your food safety...\n\nTo give you another example of how Monsanto has been able to carefully position itself and its wares into a near-invincible position, consider this: The reason why genetically engineered food hazards have never been studied beyond 30 days, nor are currently being studied, is because the corporations controlling the patented seeds, such as Monsanto, are allowed to prevent independent studies per current patent laws. That's right, genetically engineered foods are patented inventions protected under copyright and proprietary information laws. And the corporations controlling the seeds only allow them to be studied under very limited conditions, and rarely (if ever) do they permit them to be studied for safety by anyone but the USDA—which conveniently has not yet seen the need to conduct rigorous long-term safety studies on genetically engineered foods.4\n\nMonsanto's political influence clearly reaches far beyond our U.S. borders. Most recently, in an effort to \"end hunger in Africa,\" the Obama administration drafted some of the world's largest food and finance companies to invest in projects all over the continent5. Much of the $3 billion effort will go toward developing seeds and fertilizers and building silos for storage. To do this, the President has rounded up the usual suspects, which includes Monsanto. However, unlike the U.S., some donor countries are insisting that their money be spent on traditional food handouts instead of genetically engineered monoculture, such as that offered by Tanseed, a Tanzanian seed company that will spend $11 million buying certified seed to be sold in little packets to small farmers. Still, the evidence tells us genetically engineered crops cannot coexist with organic or conventional crops. They usually end up contaminating nearby fields, turning those farmers into patent-infringing criminals in the process—a scenario no farmer on any continent could ever have imagined a couple of decades ago. Another project seeking to establish genetically engineered crops in Africa is the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA). Through this alliance, heavy-weights like Monsanto and other biotech companies, along with the Gates Foundation, are foolishly promoting GE crops as the answer to Africa's hunger problem. But donating patented seeds, which takes away the farmers' sovereignty, is not the way to save the third-world poor. The Gates Foundation has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to AGRA, and in 2006 Robert Horsch was hired for the project. Horsch was a Monsanto executive for 25 years. In a nutshell, the project may be sold under the banner of altruism and 'sustainability', but in reality it's anything but. It's just a multi-billion dollar enterprise to transform Africa into a GE-crop-friendly continent. In the end, such \"humanitarian\" efforts are doomed to fail while allowing Big Biotech to make obscene profits at the poor's expense. African farmer's will likely encounter the same problems as those in India, where farmers growing genetically engineered crops have been committing suicide due to financial hardships at a rate of one farmer taking his own life every 30 minutes...\n\nA recent lawsuit against Monsanto by Brazilian farmers also highlights the harsh economic realities for farmers who take up growing genetically engineered crops. According to a recent RT News article6: \"Five million Brazilian farmers are locked in a lawsuit with US-based biotech giant Monsanto, suing for as much as 6.2 billion euros... The farmers claim that Monsanto unfairly collects exorbitant profits every year worldwide on royalties from 'renewal' seed harvests. 'Renewal' crops are those that have been planted using seed from the previous year's harvest. While the practice of renewal farming is an ancient one, Monsanto disagrees, demanding royalties from any crop generation produced from its genetically-engineered seed. Because the engineered seed is patented, Monsanto not only charges an initial royalty on the sale of the crop produced, but a continuing 2 per cent royalty on every subsequent crop, even if the farmer is using a later generation of seed. 'Monsanto gets paid when it sell the seeds. The law gives producers the right to multiply the seeds they buy and nowhere in the world is there a requirement to pay (again). Producers are in effect paying a private tax on production,' Jane Berwanger, lawyer for the farmers told the Associated Press reports. In the latest installment of the legal battle erupting in South America, the Brazilian court has ruled in favor of the Brazilian farmers, saying Monsanto owes them at least US$2 billion paid since 2004. Monsanto, however, has appealed the decision and the case is ongoing. In essence, Monsanto argues that once a farmer buys their seed, they have to pay the global bio-tech giant a yearly fee in perpetuity – with no way out.\"\n\nIn the U.S., labeling genetically engineered foods is likely the best shot we have at circumventing Monsanto's power-grabbing ways and stopping the unchecked proliferation of genetically engineered foods. This is why we strongly support state initiatives, such as California's 2012 ballot initiative to require genetically engineered foods sold in the state to be labeled. This is a powerful strategy that could have the impact of a national law. Because large food companies are unlikely to have dual labeling; one for California and another for the rest of the country. It would be very expensive, not to mention a logistical and PR nightmare. To avoid the dual labeling, many would likely opt to ditch genetically engineered ingredients from their products entirely, especially if the new label would be the equivalent of a skull and crossbones label--and that's exactly what Monsanto fears GMO labeling will be. \n\n\n\nHere's a direct quote from the president of a Monsanto subsidiary: \"If you put a label on genetically engineered food you might as well put a skull and crossbones on it.” – Norman Braksick, president of Asgrow Seed Co., a Monsanto subsidiary; Kansas City Star, March 7, 1994. This is why supporting this initiative is so important, as victory in California will likely eliminate most genetically engineered foods from the rest of the U.S. as well. Powerful confirmation of this belief occurred earlier this year, when both Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo Inc. chose to alter one of their soda ingredients as a result of California's labeling requirements for carcinogens7. This is a PERFECT example of the national impact a California GE labeling requirement can, and no doubt WILL, have. While California is the only state requiring the label to state that the product contains the offending ingredient, these companies are switching their formula for the entire US market, rather than have two different labels: \"Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. are changing the way they make the caramel coloring used in their sodas as a result of a California law that mandates drinks containing a certain level of carcinogens bear a cancer warning label. The companies said the changes will be expanded nationally to streamline their manufacturing processes. They've already been made for drinks sold in California.\"\n\nThe California Right to Know Genetically Engineered Food Act11 has already been submitted to the State Attorney General. The next step is the campaigning. Remember, if California can get the law passed in November, it's going to have the same impact as national law, for the reasons I mentioned earlier. It's going to be an enormous battle, as the biotech industry will outspend us by 100 to 1, if not more, for their propaganda. So needless to say, the campaign needs funds. If you have the ability, I strongly encourage you to make a donation. I urge you to get involved and help in any way you can. Be assured that what happens in California will affect the remainder of the U.S. states, so please support this important state initiative, even if you do not live there!

bonuses are contingent on previous bonus play meaning that for a player to be eligible to claim the second bonus the player must lose the entirety of the initial deposit bonus and winnings derived

amount claimed is deducted from the withdrawal that is to say a player can only cash out winnings derived from their use of the bonus beyond the bonus amount its notable that there is no limit on this

            "text": "Formerly owned by the Crystal Palace Group, Silver Oak Casino is a rebranded property that is currently under brand new management that has no ties to Crystal Palace Group. Silver Oak is licensed to do business out of Costa Rica and that’s their home base as well. The new Silver Oak management team has worked hard to rebrand their online casino and reach out to the online gambling community. Having completed the required due diligence research, OCS can safely state that the new and improved edition of Silver Oak Casino is poised to be a serious contender in the high stakes US facing igaming world.\n\nReaching that goal means acquiring a strong reputation, retaining players, and receiving positive customer service ratings. These are not easy goals to achieve in this highly competitive business. However, Silver Oak Casino has gotten off to a great start in attaining its goal of becoming one of the top-ranked US facing online casinos. Silver Oak is backed by a Technical Systems Testing (TST) fairness accredited software platform that is powered by Real Time Gaming, and also offers industry standard cashier transaction encryption. This means that players should feel 100% safe in wagering here. It must be noted that players from the state of Kentucky cannot be accommodated by Silver Oak.\n\nThe gaming package offered at Silver Oak Casino is nothing less than the best of all that Real Time Gaming provides. For those who are unfamiliar with RTG, this means rapid playing speeds, stunning graphics, and a wide selection of games – especially slots. To take a look for yourself, visit the Silver Oak Casino Website, then click the Games tab. It’s also worth noting that this is one of the best designed casino websites we’ve seen in quite some time. The layout is simple, clean, and sharp, and the site is easily navigable, content-rich, and user friendly.\n\nWhen you reach the Casino Games page, you’re given the option of using their “Casino Games Finder.” That allows you to explore games in these categories: Most Popular, Poker Games, Random Jackpots, and Bonus Rounds. New players will find this feature especially helpful as many come to an online casino knowing what kind of game they want to play, but often find the vast portfolio of online casino games a bit overwhelming. The main games page also gives players the choice of clicking on the “Full Games List” tab, opening a hyperlinked page with listings of Silver Oak’s entire portfolio of casino games.\n\nThis is only one example of the extremely well designed Silver Oak Casino website. Many online casinos make you search for game rules that are only available inside the software platform, and even then are frequently incomplete. Silver Oak gives you complete descriptions and rules of every casino game in extensive detail with absolute transparency. Their slots descriptions are particularly impressive, and go into greater detail than simply the number of reels and paylines. If you carefully read the descriptions and rules, you’ll not only understand how to advance to the bonus round, but you’ll know what you need to do once you get there. If we had a complaint, it would be the lack of high resolution screen shots of the games, and hopefully that will be provided at some point. Of course, the very best way to experience the games is by playing. While they don’t yet offer an instant Flash platform, the Silver Oak Casino Download lets players try out the games with fun money accounts that have unlimited credit reloads.\n\nWith all these great features, it’s still free promotions and solid bonuses that make or break an online casino. The great news for everyone who is a fan of free cash bonuses (and who isn’t?) is that we’ve saved the best part of Silver Oak Casino for last in this review. When you visit the Promotions page, you’ll see a number of Silver Oak bonus codes (even including no deposit bonuses), as well as a list of new and ongoing promotions. Silver Oak offers: $10,000 in free welcome bonus money, Cashback Bonuses, bankroll protection, and a $10,000 Giveaway.\n\nTheir welcome bonus package is made up of ten consecutive 100% Match Bonuses that are each worth up to $1,000 Free per deposit. Silver Oak Casino bonus codes are “SILVEROAK1″, “SILVEROAK2″, “SILVEROAK3″ and continue that way through ten deposits. You should note that the terms and conditions for these bonuses may be viewed from a link on the righthand navigation menu of the promotions page, and are not located directly below the bonus description as they often are at other casinos. The most significant facts you need to know are that the play-through requirement is 30x, and there are wager restrictions on Baccarat, Craps, Roulette, Pai Gow Poker, and Sic Bo, and 50% play-through contribution on Table Games and Video Poker games including Blackjack. The maximum amount of winnings that a player is allowed to cash out from bonus wagers is double the face value of the bonus. This means $2,000 in eligible winnings for a full $1,000 bonus.\n\nPlayers should also note that the 2nd through 10th bonuses are contingent on previous bonus play, meaning that for a player to be eligible to claim the second bonus, the player must lose the entirety of the initial deposit, bonus and winnings derived thereof. That makes it a second-chance bonus. If you lose that, you’re then entitled to a third-chance bonus, and so on. Having said that, it still makes sense to go with more bonus money on the first deposit. If you bank some lucky wins and come out ahead, the remaining bonuses will not be available. In any case, there are cashback and loyalty bonuses (more on these below) that may be claimed on future deposits.\n\nIf and when Lady Luck is not with you, Silver Oak Casino provides consolation with bankroll protection. That’s basically insurance that is worth 10% cashback on weekly losses. If you happen to be a high roller who doesn’t like to use deposit bonuses, Silver Oak offers 30% to 60% cashback bonuses on deposits ranging from $1,000 to $20,000. Remember that cashback credits are also subject to the normal bonus play-through requirements.\n\nFinally, Silver Oak Casino offers a $10,000 bonus chip giveaway each month (standard bonus play-through). Every player who deposits $25 or more at least twice in any given month is automatically entered with a chance to win what is likely the single largest bonus that has ever been awarded on a monthly basis.\n\nU.S. bettors seeking a reliable place to deposit and process cash withdrawals need look no further than Casino Titan. Casino Titan clearly deserves its spot on the OCE Best Online Casinos list, ranking in the top five percent of Real Time Gaming licensees as well as being in the top twenty among hundreds of online casinos regulated by Netherlands, Antilles. U.S. players who have become accustomed to delayed payouts in today’s online gambling world will find Casino Titan a most welcome exception.\n\nPlayers can thank Netad Management Limited for arranging payment processor relationships that guarantee their payments will be processed in a timely manner. Casino Titan holds its licensing credentials through Curacao under the corporate name of Netad. Netad’s customer service department processes withdrawal requests 24/7 through live chat, toll-free telephone, or by email.\n\n Having laid a solid business foundation is essential, but the reason U.S. players find Casino Titan to be such an excellent online gambling destination are their slots tournements and promotions.  When it comes to slots, daily tournaments are held on the most popular RTG Casino Slots including Texan Tycoon, Crystal Waters, and Loose Caboose. Low entry fees mean that these are among the very best low-risk slot tournaments open to U.S. players, and winnings are paid out on a pool basis. Scheduled slot tournaments are posted for viewing once you are logged into the software platform, and you can download it right here.\n\nBonuses and Promotions at RTG licensees are often hit-or-miss, but not at Casino Titan, which has offered players a regular slate of ongoing promotions as well as a strong welcome bonus package. New players have the option of claiming a free $7 chip just to try out the games with no risk (with no deposit needed), a High Roller Bonus, and an all-inclusive welcome bonus package valued at up to $3,000 Free over the course of four deposits. Players are required to download the software to receive the $7 Free chip and meet a 50x play-through ($350 in wagers) as well as making a minimum deposit of $20 to cash out any winnings (up to $100) that are derived from the free chip. Players should keep in mind the $100 maximum withdrawal term (very common for such no-deposit bonuses), for they will not be able to cash out large jackpot wins greater than $100 if the play-through is still being met when they hit the jackpot.\n\nThere is no maximum cashout limit for the welcome bonus package that consists of play-bonuses, although players cannot cash out the amount of the bonus itself. For instance, the first bonus is worth 400% of the amount deposited (with a minimum $20 deposit) up to $1,000 Free. Once players meet the 40x play-through and make a withdrawal request, the original bonus amount claimed is deducted from the withdrawal. That is to say, a player can only cash out winnings derived from their use of the bonus (beyond the bonus amount). It’s notable that there is no limit on this amount, so if a player hits a large jackpot while meeting the play-through, the whole sum beyond the bonus amount may be cashed out.\n\nThe above play-bonus claim code is ELECTRIC400. Three bonuses can be claimed in succession of this bonus and their claim codes are:\n\nDeposit Bonus #2 (TITAN300): 300% worth up to $900 Free\n\n Deposit Bonus #3 (WELCOME200): 200% worth up to $600 Free\n\n Deposit Bonus #4 (PACKAGE100): 100% worth up to $500 Free\n\nThis is an excellent offer in comparison with most other multi-deposit welcome package bonuses, though remember that this is aimed at slots wagers, as restrictions prevent most games from meeting the play-through. Two of the exceptions are Pai Gow Poker and Blackjack, but only 5% of these wagers can be counted toward the play-through requirement. As an example, $100 in Blackjack wagers equals $5 in wagers on the overall bonus play-through. Players should also keep in mind the fact that a bonus cannot be claimed once wagering has commenced. When a wager has been made using bonus money, the bonus may not be removed. The player agrees to be bound by the play-through and the terms of the bonus. Also keep in mind that bonuses expire within 45 days of being claimed. Thus, it’s necessary to have your wagers made so you can meet the play-through.\n\n- No wagering is permitted on progressive jackpot games with bonus money.\n\n - A $2,500 weekly limit is placed on withdrawal requests for non-progressive jackpot winnings. This limit can only be raised at the discretion of management, who will consider player status in making their determination.\n\n - Bonus abuse and any irregular betting patterns are strictly monitored by Casino Titan.\n\nAs an example, a player who switches from $25 wagers to $0.50 bets once the bulk of a bonus play-through has been met or someone who is placing unusually large wagers that are valued at more than 30% of their bonus bankroll on a single wager might possibly be classified as abusing the bonus system. Such policies are standard at online casinos, so while there is no issue with changing betting stakes, players should remain aware of moderating their betting patterns. Those players desiring to make larger wagers using bonus money should consider claiming Casino Titan’s High Roller Bonus worth 50% up to $750 Free. They can claim this bonus on the initial deposit (using UseMyWallet, Money Bookers, Eco Card, Neteller, eWalletXpress, or wire transfer) and it may be used as a substitution for the initial bonus of the four-deposit welcome package. In short, the previously mentioned deposit bonuses 2-4, may be claimed after a player has claimed the High Roller bonus on the first deposit.\n\nCasino Titan’s loyalty incentive program offers serious rewards for returning players (much  more than what you’ll find at the vast majority of casinos friendly to U.S. players), including special Happy Hour bonuses and weekly bonuses that are valued at up to 300% free on reload deposits.\n\nWin Palace is legally licensed and regulated through Curacao eGaming (aka Cyberluck), the master licensing body of The Netherlands, Antilles.\n\nLodolia Investments, Win Palace’s parent company, holds their Curacao gaming license, which guarantees that  proper due diligence was exercised by the Netherlands Department of Justice in granting a gaming license to Lodolia. It also ensures regular audits and means that all regulatory requirements are being satisfied.\n\nReal Time Gaming powers Win Palace’s 100+ casino games that are available for download (these are also offered in instant Flash mode). With new games being released during the year, RTG ranks among the leading developers of software for the iGaming market, particularly for online casinos that are U.S. friendly, such as Win Palace. Players will feel comfortable and secure knowing that Win Palace’s platform has met criteria to receive certification for technical compliance to deliver absolutely fair and random (unpredictable) hand results by Technical Systems Testing (TST). Founded in 1993, TST is a totally independent gaming systems testing house with a sterling reputation in the online as well as the terrestrial gaming industries. Their certification is a hard-earned mark of approval that assures players of absolute excellence and fairness.\n\nIn addition to such exceptional accreditations, Win Palace Casino qualifies for their top-listing at OCS with great features like daily slot tournaments, fantastic welcome bonuses, High Roller VIP management, ongoing promotions, and a truly dedicated team of customer service team reps, available 24/7 via live chat, toll-free telephone, and email.\n\nWin Palace gives new players either a 200% $1K Games Bonus on their first two deposits, a 300% $3K Slots Bonus on the first deposit alone, a 200% $2K High Roller Games Bonus on the first deposit, or Blackjack and Video Poker Match bonuses that are worth up to $500 Free and may be claimed as many as five times each.\n\nNaturally, certain wagering requirements have to be met before withdrawing any winnings gained from bonus money, and we are happy to announce that the terms at Win Palace are extremely reasonable. Even though the play-through for slots bonuses (25x) could be lower, the 35x playthrough for high roller bonuses and general games is terrific. Video Poker and Blackjack are posted with a 25x play through, but please note that only 25% of every wager counts. This effectively makes the play-through 100x if all wagers are placed on Blackjack or video poker, and that is the standard for low House Edge game bonuses.\n\nContinuing bonuses at Win Palace feature weekly bonus offers that may each be redeemed as many as 40 times. Both table games and slots are covered by these bonuses. Based on the weekly amount deposited, the bonuses may exceed over 300% in free bonus cash.\n\nDaily slots tournaments are hosted by Win Palace. The tournament schedule is posted online and can be viewed by anyone logged onto the software platform. While these slots tournaments are generally on the smaller end, this can actually be a plus, as it means far fewer players are competing for a share of the pot percentage winnings. In addition, many times the entry fees are only a few dollars with low rebuy’s for under a dollar, making Win Palace’s online slots tournaments a lot lighter on your bankroll.\n\nWhile Win Palace Casino provides dedicated account managers for their VIP players (higher rollers), they strive to offer personalized service to each player that calls Win Palace home. The management has truly made a commitment to offering a high degree of customer satisfaction to OCS, and so far, they been true to their promise. As always, we invite you to share your personal experience by using the link directly below.\n\nAlong with world famous Club UK and Club Euro, Club World Casinos also runs operations for CLUB USA CASINO, a site that’s increasingly becoming one of the most visited destinations for online gambling in the United States. Real Time Gaming, widely known for strict regulation of their games and their good reputation, powers Club World Casinos. Based in the United Kingdom since 2005, their customer service organization is outstanding and is highly respected for always treating players right. Club World is supported by Real Time Gaming accreditations that also include memberships in iGGBA and IGC, and has received an inherent fairness certification from Technical Systems Testing (TST).\n\nClub World Casinos is now offering noteworthy special promotions and bonuses to players.  First time players receive a general slots-friendly Welcome bonus up to €/£/$777 Free or a Games bonus valued 100% up to $150 Free (Bonus Code NEW100). The Games bonus may be used towards wagers on everything with the exception of Craps, Baccarat, Sic Bo and Roulette and has a 50x wager requirement (especially good for a Blackjack/Video Poker bonus). The $777 offer (Bonus Code BIGSLOT) may be used for slots and keno wagers, and has a 20x play-through.\n\nUnlimited bonus money winnings may be cashed out by players—- something you’ll rarely find anywhere! It’s not likely that kind of offer will last very long, so to receive these bonuses you’ll want to act immediately. Keep in mind that online casino bonuses are processed in different ways depending on the casino. At Club USA Casino, players must claim their bonus with the unique code that is located in the promotional or cashier page of their site PRIOR to making a deposit.\n\nClub World is highly regulated and tightly audited by the Curacao Gaming Commission and the government of Netherlands, Antilles. Netherlands, Antilles presently licenses over 300 sites for online gambling, with Club World among the most highly regarded and best known. The degree of transparency at Club World Casinos is greater than that found at some of the other Curacao casinos, a powerful demonstration of their desire to truly earn the full trust of players. Club World’s company headquarters are at:\n\nThey can be contacted 24/7 toll-free, and live chat is available on their website.\n\nWhen it comes to privacy and security, Club World Casinos processes transactions and stores transaction records using advanced RSA key encryption technology. They will never share their user’s private information with any third party, and all data is secured by SSL firewall connections that are VeriSign certified. Fraud is deterred with IP address tracking, which is also the method they use to solve technical problems and provide secure identification for each user accessing Club World Casinos. That’s the kind of security that lets players feel safe and completely secure in making deposits.\n\nClub World’s site has a “Cashier” page that provides information regarding the various options for making deposits and withdrawals, such as the minimum and maximum limits, countries that are excluded from service, and how long it takes to process each type of transaction. Each type of deposit, with the exception of wire transfers, is processed instantaneously, and has to be used for a minimum $20 deposit and $1,000 maximum deposit.\n\nFor wire transfers, there is a $300 minimum and no maximum and up to 10 days must be allowed for processing. To reward users of eWallets like Eco Card, Neteller, and Click2Pay, a 10% bonus will be given by the cashier to each deposit made via these eWallet services.\n\nMethods of withdrawal are similar to those used for making deposits, and there is a minimum of $20 and maximum of $3,000 for a single withdrawal transaction. Withdrawals are processed instantly with a few exceptions: eWallet Xpress withdrawals have a $1,000 maximum and require an hour processing time; wire transfers have no maximum but have a $300 minimum withdrawal and up to ten days must be allowed for processing; and ACH and Cheque have a $100 minimum withdrawal and five to ten business days must be allowed for processing. Remember that Club World, like the majority of online casinos with strong fraud-prevention systems in place, does need players to verify their accounts with a faxback form. Players in the United States may have some additional wait times due to jurisdictional restraints.\n\nSuperior Casino, in addition to DaVinci’s Gold and Sloto’Cash Casino, ranks as one of Rival Gaming Software’s best performing online casinos. Rival Gaming’s exceptional bonus and game selection is very well promoted by Superior Casino, which, along with Superior Poker, comprise the Superior Group. Founded in 2003, the Superior Group is owned by Silverstone Overseas Limited, Kent, Folkestone, UK. Their parent company, Sonsoral NV, is incorporated and fully licensed for operating online casinos by the Government of Curacao, Netherlands Antilles.\n\nIndependent audits are conducted every month to ensure fair payouts and the software platform has been deemed inherently fair and earned Random Number Generator (RNG) certification by CertainKey Inc. (Go to certainkey.com to get an idea of the extensive measures they use to prevent fraud and hacking) this means that players can be secure in the knowledge that they are receiving a truly safe and fair online gambling experience. Players in the U.S. have even greater cause for celebration.\n\nTwo bonuses and games at Superior Casino truly stand in striking contrast to most online casinos. When it comes to bonuses, new players are entitled to receive $602 Free over a period of six months. We won’t ask why they put in an extra $2 rather than simply making it an even $600, as that is how the numbers have played. Anyway, we’re hardly going to argue about a couple of extra free bucks!\n\nTo begin with, new players have the option of taking advantage of either the Slots-only bonus of 100% up to $1,900 Free (three deposits), the $20 no-deposit bonus or the All-games bonus worth up to $1,000 Free total (on three deposits).\n\nIf you’re not familiar with the way bonuses work, your free money has to be played a specific number of times over. Depending upon the bonus and the amount of the play-through, certain games are counted towards meeting the play-through. With their slots-only bonus, not surprisingly, before you can cash out your bonus money, you’ll first have to place a minimum number of bets on the slot machines. In this case, it’s 25x the bonus and deposit.\n\nWith the all-games bonus, every bet made at all and any games goes towards fulfilling the play-through requirement, which in this case is 35x. When you take into account the fact that you can play Video Poker and Blackjack to meet this betting requirement, we have to conclude that these are among of the most player-friendly bonus terms OCS has ever seen. Superior’s no deposit bonus boasts an extraordinarily low 20x wager requirement (truly very low for a true no deposit bonus). Players should keep in mind the fact that depending upon the percentage of the specific bonus, Superior Casino does impose a limit on maximum withdrawals for winnings that are earned using bonus money. Be sure to check with customer service, found within the software platform, prior to claiming your bonus if you’re unsure of the exact terms.\n\nIn addition, Superior Casino provides excellent loyalty rewards for players. These include up to 20% cash back on weekend deposits, 100 percent weekly bonuses, “Happy Hour” promotions, giveaways of free chips, and increased earnings on comp points.\n\nRealizing that there are players who prefer not to gamble with bonuses (thus being bound by their terms and conditions), we feel it’s worth looking at the other factors that make Superior Casino an excellent place for online gambling, whether you gamble with bonuses or not. As we said, Rival’s games are among the highest quality ever made. At Superior Casino, the full suite of games is available, including the innovative I-Slots and intensely realistic table games comparable to those you’d play at a casino in Las Vegas. As players may open Fun-money accounts to play using unlimited free credits, we suggest downloading the software and testing the games out firsthand. The I-Slots in particular, really have to be played in order to do them justice. They feature unfolding, character-based stories, and are without doubt the most entertaining online slots that we’ve ever seen. In addition to the entertainment value, their bonus rounds are quite lucrative.\n\nTo get started at Superior Casino, just go to the website and download the software download (they don’t have a Flash version available). Once you enter your registration information, you’ll be able to choose from six methods for deposits and withdrawals, put funds in your account, or just start playing in practice mode. Remember, you can easily get in touch with customer service through live chat or toll-free phone.  Have a great time and good luck!\n\nClub World’s accreditation and well respected operation make any of their projects noteworthy, and Club World Casinos Group’s newest gaming destination is High Noon Casino. In business since 2004, Club World’s expanding online casino network has attracted players from across the world, and the United States is one of their important markets. Of all the licensees using Real Time gaming software, Club World is among the highest rated, not surprising given their strong commitment to high quality customer service that far exceeds simply live chat and toll free phone support. High Noon Casino provides those convenient options for contacting them, as well as a mailing address, which is not common for online casinos, but that’s where their customer service begins rather than ends. At High Noon you’ll find a support team that is highly knowledgeable as well as friendly and eager to assist you. Furthermore, players will appreciate the very generous welcome bonuses and comp loyalty program, as well as the ongoing daily promotions. Add to that the attractively designed site and entertaining gaming experience and you’ll see why Club World Casinos has earned its reputation for top of the line service and player-friendly features.\n\nHigh Noon rewards players looking for free bonus money, providing a no-deposit bonus that is one of a very few that are truly worthwhile. High Noon’s “Six Shooter” no deposit bonus is not only one of the bigger bonuses we’ve seen ($60 free), but it also features reasonable play-through terms. By comparison, most online casino no-deposit bonuses are less than half of High Noon’s bonus, and usually restricted by terms that make it hard to cash out winnings from the bonus, and/or place maximum cashout limits at nothing larger than the bonus itself, pretty well defeating any incentive into making the play-through. At High Noon, on the other hand, a player can cash out as much as $300 with a 50x play-through, one of the very best no-deposit bonuses we’ve ever seen. Use bonus code: SIXSHOOTER.\n\nNow, we realize that not all players are interested in no-deposit bonuses, particularly those who prefer not to risk hitting a major jackpot only to discover that they hadn’t met the play-through and were limited to a maximum withdrawal. These players, who are willing to put down an initial deposit but still want some bonus money as long as there aren’t restrictions on the amount that can be cashed out from bonus winnings, will want to go with High Noon’s percentage welcome bonus. These bonuses have absolutely NO maximum cashout. Players have a choice of a 200% Slots Bonus worth up to $2,000 Free on a single deposit (as good a slots bonuses as we’ve seen) and a 100% Match Blackjack/Video Poker Bonus up to $500 Free. The slots bonus has a wager requirement of 20x, while the BJ/VP bonus is a standard 50x ((addition. Use bonus codes HIGHNOON200 and HIGHNOON100.\n\nHigh Noon seriously rewards player loyalty with a comp program that rewards 1 point for each $10 wagered. While a lot of online comp programs place a host of restrictions on withdrawing cash accrued with comp points, there are no wagering or cashout restrictions whatsoever at High Noon, one more reason why they are one of our top-rated online casinos.\n\nPowered and licensed by RTG Software, which Technical Systems Testing (TST) has independently tested for inherent RNG fairness, High Noon offers a selection of more than 100 casino games ready for download, in addition to a secure Flash version of the software that affords players instantaneous access to their most popular table games, video poker, and slots. Bets can be placed with fun-money or actual cash at High Noon, and though a player is never obligated to make monetary deposits, they will be not find better odds at any other online casino destination. In fact, in any given month, High Noon’s average payout return on games is 94-97%.\n\nReal-money players can choose from various withdrawal and deposit methods at High Noon, among them all of the major eWallets (Neteller, Click2Pay, Instadebit, MoneyBookers and others), and also use ACH eWalletXpress, Wire Transfer and certified check for withdrawals. Players must fill out a “verification form” that will be used to verify identity and prevent fraud before winnings can be paid out (up to $3,000 per week, excluding network progressive jackpot wins). This standard protocol is used at all online casinos and protects both the player and the casino.\n\nOne of the newest online casinos powered by Real Time Gaming software, Grande Vegas Casino offers a highly realistic “Virtual Las Vegas Casino.” Designed with a theme that appeals to land-based gamblers, especially Las Vegas players, Grande Vegas Casino opened for business to online gamblers in the U.S. beginning in 2009. Ever since its opening, Grande Vegas has achieved great popularity with their target audience, and also has a large following of gamblers located in the UK.\n\nAs we said, Grande Vegas Casino is licensed by RTG. That guarantees players a secure and fair gaming experience, as well as access to highly advanced graphics and playing controls that are user-friendly. Grande Vegas’ software platform is independently certified to ensure that it delivers truly random and fair hand results by none other than Technical Systems Testing, the internationally recognized and accredited testing facility that has extensive experience auditing both land-based as well as online gambling software systems.\n\nGrande Vegas provides players with a highly secure platform for processing their financial transactions and storing private registration information. The use of 128-bit data encryption and Secure Socket Layer firewalls guarantees that all data exchanged between a player’s personal home computer and Grande Vegas Casino servers is guaranteed to be safe and secure. The Flash and download versions of the software package both offer the same high degree of security, with the download version simply providing a greater selection of online casino games.\n\nAs far as the games themselves, Grande Vegas has over a hundred RTG titles available, and these include a full slate of Las Vegas table games, video poker, slots, and even hard-to-find titles such as Vegas Rummy and Super 21. Grande Vegas’ full portfolio can be explored and games can be played with fun-money credits once you open a free account. All you need provide is a valid email and mailing address, and you won’t have to receive mailings unless you so desire, nor do you have any obligation to make a real money deposit.\n\nOf course, serious gamblers will be eager to make real money deposits, as Grande Vegas really provides a wealth of massive Las Vegas-style promotions. Ultimately, these promotions and the bonuses at Grande Vegas Casino are what makes this an outstanding online casino and earns the site its listing on the OCS Real Time Gaming casinos page.\n\nNew players receive a welcome bonus that is valued at 100% up to $100 Free, with a low 15x play-through on all games with varying percentage contributions (Bonus Claim Code: 100MATCH). Several things make this an excellent welcome bonus. In addition to it being spread out over consecutive deposits and taking a minimum $20 deposit to claim, the wager requirement is an extremely low 15x. Every game contributes to the wager requirement, though in different percentages. As is always a good idea, players are encouraged to read the complete terms and conditions prior to claiming.\n\nGrande Vegas’ ongoing bonuses are also seriously worthwhile. They offer a new slate of bonuses every month, and at the time we wrote this online casino review, they offered five 100% Match bonuses that were worth up to $100 each. Among their ongoing promotions are the Grande Redeposit Offer, paying a 50% bonus on every deposit made with select eWallets, as well as weekly bonus offers that are available to players every Monday and Thursday. On both of these days, a slots bonus may be claimed up to ten times, and is valued at 50% up to $1,000 free on every bonus (15x play-through). Their casino games bonus (which is valid on Video Poker and Blackjack) may be claimed five times every day and is valued at 50% up to $100 Free every bonus. The truly great thing about the bonuses on Blackjack and Video Poker is that fact that the play-through is only 5x!\n\nPlayers should be aware that a maximum withdrawal limit is placed on earnings gained with bonuses worth more than 200%. That is still quite reasonable nonetheless, as it is 5x the amount of the bonus and deposit amount.\n\nOne more thing that’s worth pointing out about Grande Vegas Casino is the exceptional customer service they provide. 24/7 service is available by toll-free phone lines in the USA and UK, but management goes the extra mile by making available live chat powered by “Live Person.” We haven’t yet rated their live chat, but we will be updating this review when we have. Nonetheless, all the customer service ratings that Grande Vegas has received have been very positive.\n\nis one of highly rated Real Time Gaming (RTG) software’s newest licensees, and among the most innovative and transparent online casinos to come along in recent times. All Star Slots gives new players very fair $787 welcome bonus, and is developing a reputation for innovative slots games and promotions that put the player first. All Star Slots is increasingly attracting the attention of the online gaming world, particularly the U.S. facing sector that is catered to by both RTG and All Star Slots.\n\nAll Star Slots is registered by the Curacao Chamber of Commerce and Industry (number: 103461, under the Netherlands Antilles government). All Star Group NV is legally permitted to offer offshore betting services over the internet, which in the case of Wizard Gaming and All Star Slots means providing service to U.S. players. The company’s gaming license is held through Cyberluck Curacao N.V. (cyberluck.com), the licensing and ezone hosting authority for the Central Government of the Netherlands Antilles. Their operations are based out of Nicosia Cyprus (Kalliopis 4A, P.C. 2013) and Curacao Netherlands Antilles (All Star Group N.V., c/o Carmanco N.V. Van Engelenweg 23), and all financial processing is handled safely and securely in Cyprus by EvoLogic Limited, All Star’s parent company.\n\nWhen it comes to issues of fairness and security, All Star Slots has received independently testing by third-party UK whitelisted testing house, TST, Technical Systems Testing. These tests verify that the software source code and Random Number Generator produce unpredictable and unbiased distribution of hand results, thus TST certification guarantees players that they are engaged in the fairest possible games.\n\nNot surprisingly, All Star Slots’ specialty is…well, slots! With exceptional graphics, innovative games, free spin features and bonus rounds, there are games here that will thrill and delight slot lovers. They currently offer more than 80 slots, and there will be more games launched during the year. Players have a choice choose of 71 five-reel video slots, 11 three-reel machines, and 8 progressive jackpot slots.\n\nFor a preview of the 127 casino games on tap, look over the game preview pages at All Star Slots Casino’s website, allstarslots.com. You’ll find images of the games and short descriptions, for at All Star Slots players can see what the site has to offer before they download the casino software. That’s one more testament to the standards of transparency found at All Star Slots. After all, can you name another online casino that posts a web page solely to give players updates on the site’s Terms and Conditions?\n\nAdditional features on the All Star Slots website include a section to help prevent and treat gambling addiction. All Star Slots lets players set strict limits on deposits, suspend accounts, and offers additional information on receiving treatment and guidance, showing their commitment to a positive gaming experience.\n\nAll Star Slots offers fantastic incentives for real money play, providing a Match Welcome Bonus that is spread over 2 deposits worth up to $787 Free. Players can also avail themselves of daily slots bonuses worth up to $7,800 a month. That comes up to $93,600 free in a year’s time. Add to that the low play-through requirement and the simple and straightforward Terms and Conditions, and you’ll see that All Star Slots offers bonuses that are really worth taking. All Star Slots also caters to every kind of casino player by offering so many bonuses.\n\nOnce you are ready to start your account at All Star Slots, you’ll need to choose the appropriate method for deposits. It’s good to know that all financial transactions are handled using SSL 128-bit encryption, so you can be assured that your safety and autonomy are well protected.\n\nDeposits can be made through eWalletXpress, Neteller, Credit/Debit card, Bank Wires/Transfers and Quick Tender/UseMyWallet. All funds are made available instantly and there is a $25 minimum deposit required for all deposit methods with the exception of Bank Wires, which have a $150 minimum requirement and a processing time of up to 10 days.\n\nSecure methods for withdrawal include Click2Pay, MoneyBookers, EcoCard, Neteller, eWalletXpress, Banker’s Drafts, Cashier’s Checks, Bank Wire/Transfers and QuickTender/UseMyWallet. Withdrawn funds are always available instantly and a $25 minimum withdrawal is required for all methods with the exception of  Banker’s Drafts (these have a $100 minimum and require 5 days processing), Cashier’s Checks (a $100 minimum and up to 10 days for processing), and Bank Wires (which have a $300 minimum and up to 10 days processing). Players should be aware that all withdrawals may be reversed within 24 hours notice, and that a fax-back form must be on file when you make your first withdrawal in order to prevent fraud.\n\nSlots Oasis Casino ranks among the top U.S. facing online casinos in the world. The Curacao licensed online casino has a well deserved reputation for providing high quality customer service and offering players an exceptional overall gaming entertainment experience. Slots Oasis has also received the attention of the online gambling community by offering a massive 400% bonus that is worth up to $4,000. That is one of the largest percentage bonuses, and quite possibly the largest welcome bonus, that we at Online Casino Suite have seen in quite some time.\n\nWhile many online casinos advertise multi-thousand-dollar bonuses, but then spread the bonus money over several deposits, at Slots Oasis they really do offer 400% up to $4,000 Free on a single initial deposit. Combined with the low 20x play-through requirement, this is one truly solid bonus. Players are advised to read all the terms and conditions prior to claiming a bonus, as there may be specific play-through restrictions. To meet requirements for this particular bonus, players can use slots, keno and scratch cards. If you are a blackjack player, Slots Oasis offers a 200% up to $1,000 Free. As blackjack is a far more strategic game than slots, this casino bonus does come with a 50x play-through and is only offered to players who use a Credit Card, NetMoney, eWalletXpress, UseMyWallet or Click2Pay to deposit real money with the cashier.\n\nIn addition to promotions and bonuses, the second thing the majority of players want to know is how well the games actually pay. It’s hardly surprising to find that, in general, online casinos give players much better odds and higher overall payout percentages than land-based casinos. Though this is not true of all online casinos, it is a given that players can be assured of fair gaming at online casinos that are licensed in reputable jurisdictions and use certified software.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Slots Oasis is licensed in Curacao (Netherlands, Antilles), considered to be one of the foremost regulatory jurisdictions in online gambling. Slots Oasis is powered by Real Time Gaming (RTG) software, one of the oldest and most well respected developers of gaming software, well known for providing realistic graphics and exceptional entertainment. The RTG platform at Slots Oasis Casino has a fairness certification seal that is issued by leading, independent testing house, Technical Systems Testing (TST), which includes among its clients IGT and Aristocrat, as well as a number of U.S. lotteries.\n\nOne more significant benefit of RTG is their large progressive jackpot network and extensive tournament schedule. Though RTG has offered ample jackpots and tournament winnings ever since their main competition (the big three of Microgaming, Playtech and Cryptologic) exited the U.S. online gambling market, RTG has coming up with some of the biggest progressive jackpots that are currently available online.\n\nProgressive jackpot games that really stand out include the Midlife Crisis and Shopping Spree, in addition to progressive Caribbean Stud, Let’em Ride Poker and Hold’em. As this review was being written, Midlife Crisis had approached the million dollar mark, and Jackpot Pinatas progressive slot was valued at more than $1.25 million. Caribbean Hold’em was also getting close to the million dollar mark, making a cumulative jackpot amount nearing five million. In terms of who actually wins these jackpots, Slots Oasis players seem to take a fair share. When you look over the Recent Winners page (via the “Why Slots Oasis” link on SlotsOasis.com), you’ll see what we mean. The last time we looked, we noticed twenty different $10,000 or greater jackpots that were won by players over an eight week span.\n\nAs we noted earlier, tournaments also abound at Slots Oasis. Unlike the majority of online casinos that mostly emphasize slots tournaments, Slots Oasis will surprise players by offering a strong lineup of Blackjack tournaments, available in single table and multi-table format. Blackjack players looking for some tournament action should remember to take advantage of the previously mentioned Blackjack Bonus worth 200% up to $1,000 Free.\n\nTo sum it up, Slots Oasis gets an A+ grade at OCS. While featuring everything that players most want from an online casino, Slots Oasis also provides terrific incentives for opening real money accounts and becoming a loyal player. By taking advantage of their weekday and weekend bonuses, you’ll be rewarded with VIP Player status before you know it.\n\nWith a well established reputation in the online casino business, Aladdin’s Gold Casino is among Real Time Gaming software’s longest running licensees. Players have given Aladdin’s Gold high marks time and time again, including U.S. based players. Having acquired every regulatory credential necessary, Aladdin’s Gold focused on earning their reputation by offering extraordinary customer service from a department that’s been based in the UK since 2006 (Steam Packet House; Cross Street; Manchester, England M2 4JU, United Kingdom). One of five online casinos comprising the highly regarded Club World Casinos group (World Online Gaming N.V.), they are licensed in the Netherlands, Antilles (Curacao), which also licenses over 180 online betting operations.\n\nThe fact that state-of-the-art Real Time Gaming software powers Aladdin’s Casino speaks volumes, as RTG is both innovative and reliable. This highly trustworthy software developer holds memberships with the RGA (Remote Gambling Association), which is a non-profit trade group that oversees the code of conduct and strict standards to ensure responsible gaming for all its members. RTG also has a membership in the IGC, the Interactive Gaming Council. They are a similar organization with the same commitment to fair and strictly regulated gaming. In addition, the RTG software platform used by Aladdin’s Gold is tested by white-listed software testing house, Technical Systems Testing (TST), based in the UK. They do regular tests that guarantee that the software RNG generates unpredictable, fair betting results.\n\nHaving satisfied the highest level of scrutiny for fairness and reliability, players will want to know how Aladdin’s Gold casino stacks up when it comes to promotions and bonuses, and they won’t be disappointed! Along with an unlimited 200% Welcome Bonus offer a player may claim an unlimited number of times during the first seven days that they have opened a real money account, a good number of ongoing weekly comps and promotions are also available. In dramatic contrast to many online casinos that have strict game restrictions on bonuses, Aladdin’s Gold has table game as well as slots-only bonuses. Their only game restrictions are bonuses on Roulette, Craps, Baccarat, and Sic Bo. That means that video poker and blackjack are fair game for strategic players, and that is quite a bit better than the majority of bonus offers available elsewhere. More than that, players have no maximum cash out on bonus money, with the play-through a low 20x for Slots and 50x for games such as Video Poker and Blackjack. Their weekly bonuses have wager requirements as low as 15x.\n\nDouble deposits, mystery coupons, and massive percentage bonuses worth over 300% are among their weekly promotions. One more significant incentive, not found at most other online casinos, are double comp points for every wager made at RTG’s progressive jackpot games, now exceeding the millions and generously paying out. As this review was being written, RTG’s “Shopping Spree” progressive slot had reached the million dollar mark, while their “It’s Good to be Bad” slot paid out over $230,000 to a couple of lucky players from the U.S.\n\nThere’s no shortage of games at Aladdin’s Gold, with over 100 available for high-speed download. There is also a Flash version for those who want instant access without a download. The graphics are simply superb, and players are invited to examine the high resolution screen shots of game interfaces at the Aladdins Gold website, or start a practice account in order to test the games while playing with unlimited fun-money credits.\n\nNaturally, there’s plenty of incentive to use real money to play the games. Not only do players receive bonuses, ongoing promotional giveaways, and access to slots tournaments, but comp points are given to every Aladdin’s Gold Casino player, and triple comp points are awarded to loyal customers. It’s worth repeated that their customer service has really been a key in Aladdin’s Gold rise to the pinnacle in a highly competitive market filled with many excellent online casinos.\n\nIt’s easy to get started at Aladdin’s Gold, as their user-friendly website offers a thorough FAQ that will answer all of a player’s questions about bonuses, technical issues, general cashier FAQ’s, and general questions. It even explains the details of each individual payment method accepted in the cashier. Aladdin’s Gold has eight such methods – most of which provide instant deposit and withdrawals, in addition to low deposit minimums. Be sure to read this and all the relevant information that is clearly presented in the FAQ’s before signing up.\n\nThere’s no better domain than Casino.com for an online gambling site, and fortunately for players, there isn’t a better online gaming experience to be had elsewhere. The name suggests a destination that attracts everyone who wants to wager online and win big money, and the reality is that Casino.com is as close to the real thing as it’s possible to get.\n\nSeveral factors make Casino.com a top pick for real money online wagering. First of all, the site has received all of the essential credentials that guarantee player security and game fairness. The fact that Casino.com is powered by Playtech Software carries a lot of weight, and every single one of the more than 100 games available here has been tested independently to ensure that the software source code delivers completely fair and unpredictable betting results. In addition, Casino.com is licensed in Gibraltar, one of the strictest gambling jurisdictions currently in operation. Through the UK Gambling Act of 2005, Casino.com has the authority to legally accept wagers from players who reside in legal jurisdictions (this means that no U.S. players can be accepted).\n\nThe software platform is available in both Instant Play and Desktop Download, and is secured using the latest encryption technology, the same kind that is used by leading financial institutions. That ensures that every transaction through the online cashier is guaranteed to be safe and secure. All gambling activity is done inside a password protected environment using Secure Socket Layer servers. Players are given access to personal financial transaction statements and game history logs to make sure that all activity is highly transparent.\n\nThis is one of the best software platforms thanks to the developers at Playtech, and the graphics and playing features are state-of-the-art. In fact, the graphics equal those of the finest 3D computer animations, while the navigation and playing features make this among the most user-friendly platforms a player can find online. Single player, multiplayer and private group playing modes are available, and the lobby provides fast access to the cashier, the bonus and promotions center, the Loyalty Lounge, and various tutorials and rules for each game.\n\nTo explore the site for yourself, just register at Casino.com using a valid email address and you’ll receive instant access to the Flash version and the download platform (both are the same, though the Flash version has less games). Casino games may be played using unlimited fun-money credits, and players are under no obligation to make real money deposits.\n\nOf course, Casino.com definitely provides strong incentives for playing with real money. For example, they offer ongoing bonuses ranging from $50 to $750 per week (depending on a player’s VIP level). Casino.com’s welcome bonus offers new players up to $200 free (40x play-through). Players who do not wish to claim this bonus should contact customer service after they make their first deposit, but BEFORE they place their initial wager. The restricted games for meeting the wager requirement include Baccarat, Roulette, Blackjack Switch, Craps, Pontoon and Sic Bo. When you are ready to cash out, just make sure you’ve either used all your bonus money or that you’ve met the wager requirement. If not, your bonus winnings may be deemed null and void. It’s also suggested that you send in your required proof of identification when you open a real money account, as that will speed up the processing time for your initial withdrawal. Proof of ID is required from all players, and needs to be completed prior to requesting an initial withdrawal.\n\nCasino.com is well aware that players have a vast selection of online casinos to choose from, and that’s why they put great effort into their customer services division and their player comp program, which is called the Loyalty Lounge. Player benefits include exclusive bonuses up to $5,000, increased deposit limits, quicker withdrawal times, comp points, as well as special prizes. As of this writing, Casino.com was giving out a brand new car, a wide array of bonuses (among them friend referrals, reload bonuses, and their weekly Happy Hour bonuses), as well as lots of free comp points. Each month, five times the amount of comp points at a specially selected game are offered at Casino.com’s Loyalty Lounge. Additionally, they feature “games of the month” tournaments that award 500,000 comp points, shared among the top five finishers.\n\nMore information about the Loyalty Lounge, bonuses and promotions, and updated progressive jackpot totals may be found on the Casino.com website.\n\n32Red Plc, the UK gaming company that is based in the online gambling friendly territory of Gibraltar, has been listed on the London Stock Exchange ever since 2005. One of the giants in the UK online gambling industry, 32Red is powered by the cutting edge software and gaming solutions developer, Microgaming. In addition, 32Red has a stellar reputation when it comes to trust and accountability.\n\nBeing regulated and licensed by the UK casino white-listed Government of Gibraltar means 32Red must follow the strict standards they impose on virtual gaming establishments. Examples of 32Red Casino’s completely transparent operations are their published monthly payout percentages verified by eCOGRA (dating back to August, 2002), betting and payout transaction validations, financial reconciliations, as well as software fairness accreditation. Also be aware that while 32Red has not yet received eCOGRA’s Safe and Fair Seal, it does undergo eCOGRA’s independent payout audits. The software Random Number Generator is regularly checked, and RNG reports for both Roulette and Blackjack are published on the 32Red website.\n\n32Red has regularly returned average game payouts in the upper nineties percentile over the years. A quick perusal of the big winners page (from the site’s “About Us” page) shows over 40 major jackpot wins that date back to 2004. That stands as a testament to the amount of money that passes through 32Red’s virtual doors. In fact, one of the largest online jackpots ever won ($/£/€/1 million on the King Cashalot progressive slot) was hit at 32Red. Given 32Red’s promise to raise the Mega Moolah jackpot up to a minimum of $/£/€/5 million, it’s certain that there are going to be a number of multi-million jackpots won at 32Red in coming years.\n\nBeing powered by Microgaming means that 32Red offers its players a selection of more than 200 casino games as well as what is arguably among the largest progressive jackpot networks online. Players can download the software platform on a PC or mobile phone (thanks to Spin3), or play the Flash version. They feature sports betting, bingo, and arcade-style games as well as their entire slate of casino games.\n\nThe online cashier at 32Red processes a variety of financial transactions for deposits and withdrawals. Barclaycard Merchant Services handles credit and debit cards with the exact same 128-bit encryption protocols that financial institutions use. Payment Trust provides fraud and security breach prevention, so players need not worry about unauthorized credit card use. Chips may be purchased with Neteller, Eco Card, UKash, Moneybookers, or Wire Transfers, and players always have secure access to a personal transaction and game history statement.\n\nPreviously offering new players a 100% Match Bonus up to $/£/€/100 Free, 32Red Casino’s welcome bonus offer currently extends to an unlimited bonus that is worth more than 300%. As little as a $/£/€/10 deposit gives players $/£/€/42 for gambling. Make a $/£/€/100 deposit and you can enter the online casino lobby sporting a $/£/€/420 bankroll. The play-through is a reasonable 30x, making this one of the better welcome bonuses that UK and Euro gamblers will find. Every game with the exception of Craps contributes to the play-through in differing percentages, as do maximum bet amounts. If a player makes wagers that exceed the max bet value for specific games, the play-through is increased an additional 100x. Thus, players are advised to carefully read the bonus terms chart to see the max bet amounts.\n\nIn conclusion, there are excellent incentives for opening your account at 32Red Casino. Players will receive excellent customer service (through 24/7 live chat, phone and email), get fast payouts, and have the chance win some of the biggest progressive jackpots at any online casino.\n\nEveryone who knows the name Richard Branson is only one step removed from knowing Virgin Casino. The very same Virgin business empire that includes Virgin Records and a wide range of entertainment, travel and shopping enterprises brings you Virgin Casino, maintaining the high standard one would expect from the finest retail store…or in this case, a brick and mortar casino. Just because Virgin doesn’t run a land-based casino doesn’t mean that they are not aware of the nature of the gambling industry and the importance of customer service.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the management team in charge of Virgin Casino boasts several years of gambling industry experience. Having ties to the largest manufacturer of casino slot machines in the world— International Game Technology (IGT) — Virgin Casino provides players a remarkably realistic virtual gaming experience that offers odds that surpass those found at Las Vegas casinos. Owing to the Wager Works software platform, owned by IGT, Virgin Casino has quickly risen to the top of the online casino pack. Wager Works currently powers close to thirty online casinos, and most of them are regulated and licensed in the UK whitelisted gaming jurisdiction of Alderney. Virgin Casino is a licensed in Alderney, meaning they are strictly regulated to par with the UK Gambling Act.\n\nPredominately catering to players in the UK, Virgin Casino cannot presently accept players who reside in the US. Each of the games provided by Wager Works has been extensively tested for inherent fairness and proper RNG operation by the highly regarded third-party testing facilities Certified Fair Gaming (CFG) and Technical Systems Testing (TST). As an added feature, the entire suite of games is only available for Flash, meaning no download is needed. That truly makes for a more convenient gaming experience.\n\nThe selection of more than 180 games features all of the basic table games you’ll find in any fully-equipped physical casino. That means you’ll find Craps, Baccarat, Blackjack Roulette, Poker, Poker hybrids, Keno, Bingo, Slots and Video Poker. Virgin’s slots are particularly unique, given the fact that Wager Works is owned by IGT, as we mentioned previously. Wager Works thus has the exclusive rights to “virtually” brand many of the most played slot machines found in casinos, such as popular favorites as Monopoly, Cleopatra, Baywatch, and The Price is Right. They even offer Wheel of Fortune and Cluedo, both of which are million-plus mega jackpot progressive games. As a matter of fact, beginning at $/£/€/1.5 million, these two mega jackpot games boast the greatest reset value of any progressive jackpot game you can find online. Virgin’s ample poker room features more than 2,100 players and has over 620 tables. Free rolls and several guaranteed-jackpot tournaments occur around the clock.\n\nPlayers seeking a bonus to enhance their bankroll will be pleased to note that Virgin offers new players a 100% Match Bonus up to $/£/€/100 free.\n\nReturning players are also eligible to receive daily promotions and bonuses all week. Virgin’s numerous ongoing promotions are hard keep up with since they offer new ones each month. You can usually depend on Roulette tournaments, Weekly reload bonuses with 20x play-through and Hot Slots promotions that offer free bonus money for all wagers that are made on specified online casino games.\n\nIn contrast to online casinos that offer the same old bonus package that may only be claimed one time, Virgin Casino is constantly coming up with something new. It isn’t unusual to earn double comp points on selected games, and have weekly game bonuses (wager $/£/€/50 get $/£/€/5 free) and monthly reload bonus offers. Take a look at the promotions page on Virgin Casino’s website to examine the current offers.\n\nVirgin Casino’s comp program is unique, as players are awarded V-points that they can redeem for flying miles and merchandise from Virgin. While it’s true that you won’t find flashy bonus offers that promise hundreds in free cash at Virgin Casino, you also won’t have to worry about the bonus entrapment issues that plague some online casinos. Virgin has created a truly trustworthy gaming destination that offers players a strong gaming package with the features that matter most.\n\nPlayers have the option of choosing from a number of secure payment methods for making a deposit. These include eWallets like Click2Pay and Neteller, and debit and credit cards such as Visa Delta and Switch. All methods also can be used for withdrawals, which Virgin is able to pay out the next day. Their minimum deposits and withdrawals are only $/£/€/5, and they allow deposit and betting limits to be customized. Withdrawals under $/£/€/3,000 do not require further identification checks, which is sometimes a significant hassle at certain online casinos.\n\nAll in all, Virgin Casino is without a doubt our top recommendation for online gamblers in the UK. The offer generous weekly bonuses, sync their loyalty and comp program with Virgin merchandise, and players can even listen to Virgin Radio as they are gambling online. When you take into account the fact that there are a fair number of other highly reputable UK casinos currently in business, it should be noted that we do not make this high recommendation for Virgin Casino lightly.\n\nThose of you familiar with the Jackpot Factory will have a good idea of what All Slots Casino has to offer. All Slots is one of the biggest, and perhaps the single largest, jackpot casino that you will find on the net, and is one of the essential destinations for players of progressive slots. All Slots is a fully functioning online casino, meaning that that a complete suite of casino games is offered to players along with bonuses, a loyalty program, and highly secure banking. These features have made All Slots a great place to play for all online gamblers, not just slots players.\n\nIn business since early 2000, The Jackpot Factory is owned by Belize-based SquareIT Ltd. Gaming licenses are held through Kahnawake Gaming Commission (Canada). All casinos in the Jackpot Factory family, All Slots among them, are powered by Microgaming’s VIPER software platform and have received eCOGRA certification. This ensures that players not only will get the excellent service they’d expect from the Jackpot Factory, but they will also find the highest level of transparency (such as published payout percentage reports and RNG certifications, and more), responsible gaming practices, and odds and payouts that are among the very best in online gambling. The truth is, they even exceed what you’ll find at the majority of casinos in Las Vegas.\n\nYou can read independently published reports from each month in 2007 by clicking the Payout Report/eCOGRA button on the All Slots site. The reports confirm that the average payouts were slightly fewer than 96% for slots, and over 97% for table games. They also paid out a huge 98% for their poker games. In order to gain a sense of how big the jackpots are at Jackpot Factory casinos, in addition to the fact some players have literally become millionaires here  ($4 billion in payouts since 2000), more than forty payouts of at least $20,000 were made in the past two months as we were writing this online casino review. That comes to nearly one $20,000+ payout every single day. Take a look at the Winners page on the site to view the complete listing.\n\nAs we said earlier, Microgaming Software powers All Slots Casino. By affording players the option of starting an unlimited play-money account, a real-money account, or both, Microgaming makes their platform of over 250 casino games available for download or easy access through Flash. One more good reason to use Microgaming software is their CashCheck and PlayCheck systems, allowing players to easily check their financial transactions and their logged gaming results through a password protected account manager. As one can quickly see by looking at screen shots and the website, All Slots Casino features pristine graphics. Get the free Instant access Flash software platform, and you can quickly test out the games and see for yourself the high quality of the site.\n\nAt present, All Slots is giving players a generous two-deposit bonus up to $/£/€/200 Free, that has to be claimed within 72 hours of making your initial deposit. The value of the bonus is 100% up to $200 Free on your first deposit. Play-through is 30x (but only 15x if you are a member of the VIP Lounge) and every game helps meet the play-through at varying percentages. All Slots also offers players a generous 10% cash back on every deposit up to $/£/€/450 free/month, equating into $/£/€/5,000 a year. A great feature of All Slots’ bonuses is the fact that they are handled by the ClearPlay Bonus System, a bonus account manager that immediately makes a player’s bonus money available and also keeps track of the play-through and simultaneously transfers your bonus credits directly into your real money account as soon as these credits are eligible. In contrast to other online casino bonuses that require players to complete the whole play-through before they may withdraw credits that were earned from the bonus, All Slots and the Jackpot Factory permit players to withdraw their funds as the bonus wager requirement is being met. That means no need to be concerned about unintentional bonus abuse. The ClearPlay Bonus System greatly simplifies the whole process. Keep in mind that the more you play, the quicker you’ll receive an invitation to join the VIP Lounge. Be sure to email customer service if you wish to receive an invitation.\n\nWe want to be sure to mention the All Slots Casino Cashier, as it provides players with a number of secure and safe and options for funding their account. Credit and debit cards may be used by any player internationally, and several of the most popular eWallets such as Neteller may be used in regions outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, All Slots offers the new EntroPay Virtual Card. This acts just like an eWallet for your private VISA credit/debit card. Bank wires are also accepted, and payouts may be processed by each of the above methods, and also by mailed check. All Slots guarantees the security of every account by using secure socket layer servers and 128-bit encryption for all data transferred through servers, the same protocols that are used by major financial institutions and e-commerce sites. Credit cards are processed by the Gibraltar-based All Slots subsidiary, Inexia Ltd./LoudWaterLimited, also the name that will appear on credit card statements.\n\nPlatinum Play Casino is the flagship site of Fortune Lounge’s online casino group, which has awarded players more than $27 million worth of progressive jackpots. Fortune Lounge is among the oldest and most highly regarded casino groups currently in operation, and was voted the Top Casino Group in the 2005 GOM online players poll. Fortune Lounge consists of three poker rooms and eight online casinos plus a bingo room under the Platinum Play name.\n\nFounded in 2004, Platinum Play Casino is powered by Microgaming software, and holds a Safe and Fair Seal from eCOGRA (which is the foremost independent, non-profit player advocate and gaming fairness certifier). Platinum Play is regulated and licensed by the Kahnawake Gaming Commission, which ensures that the highest standards of fairness and safety will be met. Offerings odds that beat those you can find in Vegas and guaranteeing the security of every account makes Platinum Play an exceptional destination for online real money wagering.\n\nPlatinum Play’s active player community, the scope of their promotions, the number of gaming options and their customer service all help the site stand out from many of its competitors.\n\nPlatinum Play provides a vast array of online casino games powered by Microgaming Software. Over 400 are available on their downloadable platform, and they also offer instant access to a Flash platform that has a slightly smaller game selection.\n\nPlayers who download the software or chose to login with Flash each receive Platinum Play’s $/£/€1,500 Free Play Bonus to win up to $/£/€100 in Free bonus money. Just play through the $/£/€1,500 in free credits a minimum of one time during a 24 hour period, and transfer up to $/£/€100 in winnings beyond the original $/£/€1,500 with a $/£/€20 deposit. This amounts to a 500% Bonus. No matter whether you win or lose from your free play, Platinum Play offers a strong 100% Match Bonus that is worth $/£/€200 Free. The play-through is 30x, and all of their games, even Roulette, Craps, and Baccarat will go towards the play-through in tiered percentage amounts. Additionally, Platinum Play offers players the option of receiving a 10% bonus on the first deposit they make using Neteller, Click2Pay, EcoCard, or EntroPay (note that none of these are open to U.S. players), up to $/£/€100 Free.\n\n***Important*** Players should not make any withdrawals prior to finishing playing through both bonuses or else you will forfeit your bonus money and your winnings (this rule is standard at all online casinos). Players who are uncertain about whether their first bonus has been played through in its entirety can easily login to their bonus manager or else contact customer support, available 24/7, and receive all the information needed. Once more, all available bonuses do require a 30x play-through and they are also game specific. That means that different games will contribute varying percentages to the play-through (though all slots contribute 100%).\n\nWhile the bonus provides a strong incentive to begin gambling with real money at Platinum Play Casino, it’s ultimately their ongoing tournaments and promotions that keep players coming back and fostering a growing community. If this sounds like an exaggeration, simply click on the International Casino Games link from Platinum Play’s Promotions page on their website.\n\nPlatinum Play pays out $1 million in prizes to players who sign up with the International Slots League Tournaments and/or take part in weekly promotions. These options afford you the opportunity to become 1 of 100 players that receive a complimentary luxury cruise as well as a 1 in 25 chance to win $50,000 cash. The greater your participation, the better your chances of winning. Slots lovers definitely don’t want to pass this by! The International Slots League Tournament features a crowded weekly schedule of slots tournaments, the majority of which are free rolls (requiring no tournament entry fee). Last year’s International Casino Games promotion climaxed on a Mediterranean cruise, where the lucky winner received $250,000. Fortune Lounge players have won a new Ford F-150, Mustang, and Jaguar, so you can see that they are more than generous!\n\nYou’ll also find that payouts at Platinum Play Casino are generous, ranking above average. If you click the eCOGRA logo found at the bottom of the page, you’ll be able to view independent audited reports that show their yearly average is over 97%. If you want a better sense of how this translates into real winnings, go to their Recent Winners page to peruse the list of hundred-thousand dollar plus jackpots recently won by players at Fortune Lounge. The year to date overall payouts at Fortune Lounge have now exceeded €100 million.\n\nA couple of other things worth discussing in our online casino review have to do with Platinum Play Casino’s banking options and their Casino School. Let’s look at the banking options first: While slightly varying according to your place of residence, Platinum Play accepts all of the major eWallets (Click2Pay,Neteller, InstaDebit, FirePay and so on). Credit and debit cards and money transfers are also accepted by the cashier. Players also receive small bonuses for several of these options. For players who are new to depositing and withdrawing funds at online casinos, Platinum Play provides a comprehensive “Banking Information” page that guides players through each step of the process, teaching them how to make secure instant deposits and withdrawals. Platinum Play processes all payments through Fountainview SA (Luxembourg) and Selborne Ltd (Gibraltar), and their use of 128-bit encryption ensures absolute account security and prevents fraud.\n\nPlatinum Play’s Casino School is basically a complete tutorial about playing all the casino games on the site, and helpfully includes game rules and software navigation. The free tutorial offered by Platinum Play is the most comprehensive we’ve seen. It’s an invaluable resource that is an essential tool for new players.

            "text": "New study concludes that water shortages may be a bigger problem than we thought.\n\nFresh water supplies are under assault on multiple fronts. We are seeing the continuing fallout from the droughts in the Western U.S. and Brazil – both are incredibly important areas to the global food supply.\n\nAt the same time, corporate hoarding of fresh water is on the rise. Nestle’s former CEO clearly stated that water supplies should be privatized and that the right to fresh, clean water is not an essential human right.\n\nKnowing that both the climate and corporate influence are converging to restrict and/or dramatically increase the cost of fresh water, two new reports reinforce that there isn’t much time left to find solutions. In fact, for an increasing number of people, water might not be available at ANY cost…\n\nAuthor Ken Anton delivered powerful history in his novel Popsicle Man of US oligarchs with Emperor’s New Clothes’ obvious crimes centering in war and money. His new novel, Cancer Vortex, provides similar powerful history of the medical oligarchs who block medically and legally proven cancer cures in order to protect industry profits in the annual billions.\n\nAs many in alternative media document, so-called “health” oligarchs act against public interest in obvious ways when the facts are examined. For example, every economic cost-benefit analysis concludes Americans would save from $100 billion to $300 billion annually if we had universal single-payer health care for all rather than “health” “care” oligarchs consuming ~one-third of all payments.\n\n10 years into a 90-day mission, little robot has traveled 25 miles on Mars.\n\nGenetically modified corn seeds are no longer protecting Brazilian farmers from voracious tropical bugs, increasing costs as producers turn to pesticides, a farm group said on Monday.\n\nProducers want four major manufacturers of so-called BT corn seeds to reimburse them for the cost of spraying up to three coats of pesticides this year, said Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja farm lobby in Mato Grosso state.\n\n“The caterpillars should die if they eat the corn, but since they didn’t die this year producers had to spend on average 120 reais ($54) per hectare … at a time that corn prices are terrible,” he said.\n\nLarge-scale farming in the bug-ridden tropics has always been a challenge, and now Brazil’s government is concerned that planting the same crops repeatedly with the same seed technologies has left the agricultural superpower vulnerable to pest outbreaks and dependent on toxic chemicals.\n\nefforts to evacuate him to Europe for treatment have been thwarted because of concerns expressed by countries he would have to fly over\n\nThe Ebola victim who sparked fears that a historic outbreak of the disease could spread globally was an American citizen, it was revealed last night.\n\nPatrick Sawyer died this week after becoming noticeably ill on a flight from Liberia in West Africa, where the worst ever outbreak of Ebola is gathering pace, to the city of Lagos in Nigeria.\n\nHis case sparked alarm across the globe because he was able to board an international flight while carrying the incurable disease – potentially infecting other passengers who could fly across the world in a nightmare scenario for health experts.\n\nPatrick Sawyer, 40, was planning to return home to Coon Rapids, Minnesota, to be reunited with his children for two of his daughters’ birthdays in August.\n\nBut his death in Lagos, Africa’s most populous city, has health workers scrambling to trace those who may have been exposed to him across West Africa, including flight attendants and fellow passengers.\n\nIN JANUARY THE U.S.-BASED CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION WARNED THAT THE NEXT PLANE COULD BRING A PANDEMIC\n\nThere has been record growth in sales of organic, non-GMO food in some of the world’s largest produce markets, a good thing for consumers and advocates of clean, wholesome, non-bioengineered commodities.\n\nIn the United States, the value of the organic foods market in 2013 exceeded $35 billion for the very first time, an increase of nearly 12 percent from the previous year, according to Eileen Bentley, small business and prepared foods manager at Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board.\n\nThe U.S. economy, as a whole, has been growing, on average, at between 1 and 2 percent for months, which is dismal.\n\nWashington State University researchers say ancestral exposures to the pesticide methoxychlor may lead to adult onset kidney disease, ovarian disease and obesity in future generations.",

            "body": "guardian news website minister stakeholders disagree over genetically modified foods minister of agriculture and rural development dr akinwumi adesina recently on the ministrys website responded to an article in the guardian written by gbadebo rhodesvivour on monsanto genetically modified foods and why nigerians should be wary also monsanto a publicly traded american multinational agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation headquartered in st louis missouri usa has reacted to the articles written by gbadebo rhodesvivour and ify aniebo on the subject the reactions and counterreactions follow the minister on monday june 2 2014 wrote i read this and was shocked at the level of total misrepresentation there is nothing correct in all this write up i normally dont respond to these kind of things but feel gbadebo should be educated on facts first nigeria does not have gmos second all the seeds used by farmers in nigeria are from conventional breeding and we allow farmers to reuse their own seeds third we support biodiversity and promote both insitu and exsitu gene banks for ensuring local biodiversity is conserved fourth we promote sensible and responsible use of modern technologies to address complex problems of diseases and pest climate change and malnutrition the author unfortunately confuses biotechnology with gmos which is done to deliberately misinform the population he does not understand science noise is not fact nor science through conventional breeding and biotechnology we have safe nutrient enriched crops such as provitamin a cassava orangeflesh sweet potato drought resistant maize flood resistant rice and bananas resistant to virulent black sigatoka disease that can wipe out all of nigerias and africas bananas and cassava varieties resistant to cassava bacterial blight that can wipe out africas largest source of food does he expect us to fold our hands and do nothing and watch poor farmers go into such devastation all the seed companies in nigeria use conventional breeding nigeria is putting in place bio safety laws to regulate use of modern biotechnology consumer and environmental safety are priority for us but we must develop and we must use new technologies responsible use of technologies while managing and preserving biodiversity and the environment and consumer safety is the role of government as minister of agriculture for nigeria i assure you that this is being done but we must not become misinformed by those that want africa to remain backward with misguided antitechnology views to communicate you can use mobile phone despite associated risks with brain cancer or tie strings to match boxes or use town criers as done in old times the former is modern technology i am sure the writer uses mobile phones yet it has risks why not try communicating with matchboxes with strings after all it is a safe technology you can travel by plane or donkey the former generates c02 but everyone uses it to travel why not try traveling to europe by donkey we must be factual sensible and responsible in our reporting nigeria is working hard to empower its millions of farmers with appropriate technologies to lift them out of poverty into wealth over 95 of all our agribusinesses are locally owned companies i believe in food sovereignty that is why i am pushing daily for nigeria to be free from dependence on food imports to feed ourselves we will feed ourselves with dignity lift millions of our people out of poverty but scare mongering with deliberate misinformation as done by gbadebo and similar antitechnology apologists is not the way to go his assertions are totally misguided and misinformed unless africa uses modern technologies our farmers output will remain low and we will remain dependent on others to feed us that is definitely not the way to have food sovereignty that will only deepen dependency on others we must feed ourselves with dignity and we must use appropriate modern technologies to do so give choices to farmers while preserving biodiversity building environmental resilience robust ecosystems and protecting health and well being of our people that is exactly what we are doing response by gbadebo rhodesvivour with all due respect mr adesinas response aside from being vague and empty has not addressed any concerns raised by my article in playing politics with the nigerian people he has spoken about everything except the elephant in the room mr adesina asserts nigeria does not have gmos sir what is monsanto doing in nigeria in the month of may 2014 an article titled government okays introduction of 40 hybrid seeds in nigeria was published in the guardian newspaper another article titled monsanto to introduce 40 new seed varieties was also published and monsantos vice president michael frank was quoted as saying that monsanto would focus on maize soybean cotton and oilgrape seed production in nigeria according to the nabda boss nigeria biotechnology development agency nigeria already has three genetically engineered crops in confined field trial he names them as bt cowpea in zaria the african biofortified sorghum also in zaria and the cassava plus at the national root crops institute at umudike abia state the institute for agricultural research iar in zaria in association with monsanto and csiro in australia have created bt cowpea using genes derived from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis which was provided by monsanto and have carried out field trials ezezika dall 2012 mr minister there is nothing conventional or natural about monsanto transgenic modifications neither is there anything natural about inserting dna from bacteria into cowpea it is clear from these experiments and associations that nigerian agencies and institutes have become mere surrogates for experimentation on behalf of foreigncommercial interests adesina asserts all the seeds used by farmers in nigeria are from conventional breeding and we allow farmers to reuse their own seeds is that the monsanto model there are so many case studies around the world that proves that this is not monsantos model prof iwu had this to say about the monsanto model one of the things they do and they do badly is that they will bring these things they will give our farmers seeds for example and they will plant these seeds regardless of whether the seeds are safe or not you can not replant the seeds the next year you will go back and start buying from them and after a while there will be total dependency and these things can be airborne and they can destroy our farms and so on prof maurice iwu a professor of pharmacognosy at the university of nigeria nsukka unn nnimmo bassey had this to say about the monsanto model we can not be forcefed by a savage biotech industry that seeks to colonize african seeds and food systems the fact that gmos will not feed the world is well studied and documented see the international assessment of agricultural knowledge science and technology for development iaastd report for example gmos will enslave the world through the intellectual property rights that allows the biotech industry to patent their seeds debars farmers from sharing or saving seeds and forces them to buy seeds every planting season it seeks to overturn age long sustainable practices nnimmo bassey nigerian environmentalist chair of friends of the earth international 20082012 so again i ask what is monsanto doing in nigeria mr adesina asserts nigeria is putting in place bio safety laws to regulate use of modern biotechnology consumer and environmental safety are priority for us aniebo had this to say about the consumer and environmental safety of monsanto gmo the few scientific researches done on the effects of these foods on humans have showed stunted growth impaired immune systems bleeding stomachs abnormal and potentially precancerous cell growth in the intestines impaired blood cell development misshaped cell structures in the liver pancreas and testicles altered gene expression and cell metabolism liver and kidney lesions partially atrophied livers inflamed kidneys less developed organs reduced digestive enzymes higher blood sugar inflamed lung tissue increased death rates and higher offspring mortality as well after gm soy was introduced in the uk allergies from the product skyrocketed by 50 percent and in the us in the 1980s a gm food supplement killed dozens and left five to 10 thousand others sick or disabled repeated use of seeds like monsantos roundupready soybeans results in vicious new superweeds that need far greater amounts of stronger herbicides to combat their toxic residues remain in crops that humans and animals then eat even small amounts of these toxins are endocrine disruptors that can affect human reproduction adversely most recently tests showed the presence of the herbicide glyphosate widely used with monsantos herbicidetolerant gm soybean and maize varieties in samples of mothers breast milk in the united states ify aniebo b sc msc mres mph is a molecular geneticist from oxford university with a masters in public health she was also recognized by nigerias president goodluck jonathan during the centenary celebrations as an inventor and innovator again i ask what is monsanto doing in nigeria the minister presents the biosafety law as an infrastructure that would look out for the interest of nigerians by rigorously testing gmo products to ensure they are safe for consumption as well as the ecosystem here is what the chairman senate committee on science and technology prof robert boroffice had to say on the biosafety bill i can speak authoritatively that mr president will be anxious to enact a biosafety law when he gets the passed bill before him for the interest of the country he will sign so that monsanto and other countries can come to nigeria to assist us in boosting agricultural production not only in food but also in area of cotton cowpea maize tomatoes somehow before the bill has been passed it is clear monsanto has prequalified is that how a biosafety bill should work mr minister it is clear that this biosafety bill is nothing more than a gateway to guarantee monsantos entry in to nigeria this coupled with the ministers framework which is available online makes it clear the focus is on big business as opposed to the safety and welfare of the nigerian people mr adesina asserts we must not become misinformed by those that want africa to remain backward with misguided antitechnology views lets see how monsanto gmo has fared in other parts of the world in india for example monsanto crop failures are linked to the suicides of 300000 cotton farmers according to physicist and author vandana shiva monsantos contributions to a suicide economy in india such as an increase in the price per kilogram of cotton seeds from 7 to 17000 rupees shiva lists additional complications indigenous cotton varieties can be intercropped with food crops monsantos btcotton can only be grown as a monoculture indigenous cotton is rain fed btcotton needs irrigation indigenous varieties are pest resistant btcotton even though promoted as resistant to the bollworm has created new pests and to control these new pests farmers are using 13 times more pesticides then they were using prior to introduction of btcotton and finally monsanto sells its gmo seeds on fraudulent claims of yields of 1500kgyear when farmers harvest 300400 kgyear on an average according to hrh prince charles of england the crisis branded the gm genocide by campaigners was highlighted recently when prince charles claimed that the issue of gm had become a global moral question – and the time had come to end its unstoppable march he condemned the truly appalling and tragic rate of small farmer suicides in india stemming from the failure of many monsanto gm crop varieties in brazil five million brazilian farmers are locked in a lawsuit with usbased biotech giant monsanto suing for as much as 62 billion euros monsanto gets paid when it sell the seeds the law gives producers the right to multiply the seeds they buy and nowhere in the world is there a requirement to pay again producers are in effect paying a private tax on production jane berwanger lawyer for the farmers in the latest installment of the legal battle erupting in south america the brazilian court has ruled in favor of the brazilian farmers saying monsanto owes them at least us2 billion so i ask for the umpteenth time sir what is monsanto doing in nigeria mr adesina uses a simplistic analogy to trivialize our health concerns in relation to risks associated with gm technology he speaks of donkeys and planes phones and matchboxes dr adesina prof borrofice have two million people marched against the airline industry or one airline company have two million people marched against the mobile phone industry the answer is a resounding no two million people all around the world in 436 cities have marched against monsanto globally protesting the negative health effects and harm their technology does to human beings and the environment why because the risks associated with this technology far outweighs the benefits but ill humour you lets say those two million people and everyone i have quoted in this article is antiscience and needs in your words educating are the 6 countries of the g8 antiscience too is the technology powerhouse – japan antiscience yet they banned gmos and have strong biosafety laws preventing and inhibiting the importation of gmo products in to their country france and manufacturing powerhouse germany banned monsanto cultivation and gmo products italy banned cultivation of monsanto and gm products england does not allow cultivation of monsanto crops and only allows gm products in to the country as animal feed and even this is under scrutiny lastly the world super power russia banned all monsanto products as well as gm products entering the country in the words of the russian prime minister medvedev if the americans like to eat gmo products let them eat it then we dont need to do that we have enough space and opportunities to produce organic food while our minister and senator are trying to pass a bill to allow monsanto to come in to nigeria russia is passing a bill to treat producers of biotech crops from companies such as monsanto the dow chemical company and syngenta as criminals with fines comparable to terrorism as coauthor of the bill kirill cherkasov said when a terrorist act is committed only several people are usually hurt but gmos may hurt dozens and hundreds the consequences are much worse and punishment should be proportionate to the crime so the question remains and i ask again what is monsanto doing in nigeria mr minister mr senator do you have as robust infrastructure as russia japan or france do you plan to set it up overnight do you have the scientific infrastructure to monitor monsanto mr minister you clearly need to educate the leaders of all these great nations as well once you are done educating me do you have more scientists at your disposal than france germany or japan or are we basing our policy on america and what america tells us is safe a nation which is controlled by profit at any cost corporations a speech made by us rep dennis kucinich on the house of congress floor in 1992 the food and drug administration decided that genetically modified organisms gmos are the functional equivalent of conventional foods they arrived at this decision without testing gmos for allergenicity toxicity antibiotic resistance and functional characteristics as a result hundreds of millions of acres of gmo crops were planted in america without the knowledge or consent of the american people no safety testing and no longterm health studies the fda americas version of nafdac has received over a million comments from citizens demanding labelling of gmos ninety percent of americans agree so why no labelling ill give you one reason the influence and the corruption of the political process by monsanto monsanto has been a prime mover in gmo technology a multimillion dollar gmo lobby here and a major political contributor mr adesina asserts unless africa uses modern technologies our farmers output will remain low and we will remain dependent on others to feed us on this i agree with mr minister so i ask sir have you fully mechanized the nigerian agriculture sector do farmers have access to funding in the form of soft loans of all the money purportedly set aside for the agricultural sector how many farmers have actually accessed those funds how is nigeria doing with regards to the maputo declaration you clearly have a reference for what optimum productivity should be do nigerian farmers get subsidized like their european or american counterparts do they yet according to the imf in its largest countries by agricultural output at purchasing power parity nigeria is ranked no 5 second to the usa which is ranked no 4 and all this was achieved without machinery and without access to funds or subsidies like their american counterparts clearly giving them all that is too much work so you propose magic seeds nigeria is dependent on imports not only due to previous issues raised but also the fact that we do not process our products eg rice till today nigeria a nation is boasting about900million revenue from the export of raw cocoa raw cocoa in the 21st century cocoa has made men fortunes since the 1800s yet we still export raw cocoa mars inc made 30billion annual turnover and that is just one chocolate company ignoring all the byproducts of cocoa processing surely it would make a lot more sense for nigeria to at least process her cocoa nigerian leadership has to evolve from its fire brigade paradigm in which it favors corporations and special interest to exploit the nation at the detriment of its people case in point the niger delta people complained for years concerning the destruction of their land their waters they could not feed themselves leadership ignored their calls champions of their cause lost their lives nigeria behaved as though the oil was for nigeria but the oil spill was for the niger delta it was only when these people after years of complaints took up guns that nigerian leadership paid attention today we pay billions in amnesty every year what would it have cost nigeria to listen back then to have enforced oil companies to clean up and do the right thing as they do in their own countries would it not have been cheaper for nigeria on the long run we are paying this price in the north currently because leaders have put selfish interest above those of the nigerian people argentina the poster child of monsanto is currently experiencing what i just spoke of research released from communities around farms where monsanto is implementing its technology showed an increase in risk for defects at birth due to exposure to pesticides in mothers the specific defects included were limb reduction urogenital anomalies cns defects or facial clefts heart conditions and ocular defects so again i ask what are monsanto and the likes doing in nigeria when full mechanization of nigerian agriculture is achieved extension service to farmers increased to meet world standards and farmers have access to loans nigeria will feed herself independently without the need to resort to gmo monsanto and the likes have no business in nigeria and the biosafety bill should not be passed because it is merely a charade to get monsanto into the country i tell you why two million people march against monsanto and not cell phone companies food and water are the most basic requirements for human life god in his wisdom made our sources of food renewable monsanto through its patent laws and systems seeks to own control and charge for what has been given to us freely this makes nigeria dependent on foreign biotech firms to feed so mr minister there is no confusion here this is what we stand against the fact that six out of the eight countries that make up the g8 have banned the cultivation of gm foods for consumption in their own countries but formed an alliance to promote and fund this initiative in our country is something every nigerian needs to ponder on on june 6 monsanto responded to rhodesvivours article earlier published in the guardian on their blog httpmonsantoblogeunigerianpapersowsmisinformationongmandhybridseeds in a post titled nigerian paper sows misinformation on gm and hybrid seeds hereunder is rvivours counterreaction entitled why we must reject monsantos trojan horse rvivour monsanto and its imperial agents such as a mr abdallah elkurebe disappointingly dont address any concerns raised instead focus on the fact that i am an architect monsanto says lets leave aside the obvious question of whether architects however qualified should be considered authorities on anything other than building design to monsanto and mr kurebe i ask did awolowo study education or was he a teacher no yet we know his effect on the educational system did obasanjo study agriculture or farming yet we know his success as a farmer and i wont talk about the late great ibrahim tahir talba of bauchi attacking the messenger from the onset shows the inferiority and weakness of your argument mr monsanto after belittling my article as a rant speaks about a statement i made with regards to genetically modified tomatoes many of the accusations in gbadebo rhodesvivours rant lack any credible substantiation or are just downright bizarre for example his claim that biotech tomatoes which dont exist btw can become toxic and cause cancer yes they dont exist now but mr monsanto conveniently does not mention why the first commercially available genetically modified food was a tomato engineered to have a longer shelf life the flavr savr rats fed genetically engineered calgene flavrsavr tomatoes developed to look fresh for weeks for 28 days got bleeding stomachs stomach lesions and seven died and were replaced in the study food safety–contaminants and toxins reviewed in jpf dmello cabi publishing 2003 in october 1991 dr edwin mathews from the department of health and human services and of the fdas toxicology group wrote to the fda biotechnology working group saying genetically modified plants could also contain unexpected high concentrations of plant toxicants in a memo dated 16 june 1993 to linda kahl consumer safety officer at the food and drug administration fda americas version of nafdac fred hines staff pathologist at the fda wrote there is considerable disparity in the reported findings of gastric erosions or necrosis lesions from the three studies provided by calgene inc this disparity has not been adequately addressed or explained by the sponsor or the laboratory where the study was conducted in 1994 dr joseph cummins emeritus professor of genetics at the university of westontario warned that the inclusion in flavr savr tomatoes of a genetic sequence from the cauliflower mosaic virus could create virulent new viruses eventually due to safety concerns and economic failure the modified tomato was taken off the market mr monsanto thats a whole lot of history to conveniently leave out dont you think below is monsantos copy and paste response to every negative complaint or tragedy their technology brings to people all over the world from argentina all the way to india and south africa roundup® brand agricultural herbicides have a long history of safe use when used according to label directions in more than 100 countries around the world comprehensive toxicological studies have demonstrated that glyphosate the active ingredient in roundup® branded agricultural herbicides does not cause birth defects or reproductive problems safe use right long history right lets talk about the safety and long history of a product you also produced and told the world was safe for a long period of time ddt in 1944 monsanto became one of the first manufacturers of the insecticide ddt to combat malariatransmitting mosquitoes despite decades of monsanto propaganda insisting that ddt was safe the true effects of ddts toxicity were at last confirmed through independent research and in 1972 ddt was banned throughout america today it is common knowledge that ddt causes cancer but back in the 1940s monsanto told us it was safe with regards to the 300000 farmer suicides in india monsanto does as a typical brutish american corporation does similar to the nra national rifle association justifies gun ownership after a mass shooting in america parents buy more guns to protect yourself from your 10 year old teachers should too or gun violence is caused by video games music and movies somehow it would seem mass killings are caused by everything except the guns i digress the real reason for farmer suicides are failed promises of monsanto the creation of pest resistance expensive seeds and the need for a larger amount of water relative to natural varieties bt cotton was a failure but guess what monsanto had been paid for their magic seeds so while their books recorded profit farmers were dying in debt according to physicist and author vandana shiva monsantos contributions to a suicide economy in india such as an increase in the price per kilogram of cotton seeds from 7 to 17000 rupees shiva lists additional complications indigenous cotton varieties can be intercropped with food crops btcotton can only be grown as a monoculture indigenous cotton is rain fed btcotton needs irrigation indigenous varieties are pest resistant btcotton even though promoted as resistant to the bollworm has created new pests and to control these new pests farmers are using 13 times more pesticides then they were using prior to introduction of btcotton and finally monsanto sells its gmo seeds on fraudulent claims of yields of 1500kgyear when farmers harvest 300400 kgyear on an average they quoted their imperial agent mr abdallah elkurebe extensively but this one quote is a true gem that the countrys subsistence agriculture can no longer supply the needs of its growing population is undoubtedly true this is the very reason for the countrys adoption of agricultural biotechnology and the biosafety law seeks to provide the framework for nigerian scientists who have done much research to move forward from field trials into commercial testing phases for eventual deployment to farmers mr abdallah elkurebe a media fellow of agricultural biosciences mr media fellow apart from interviewing people and recording what they tell you have you done any critical research i mean according to you the human body would always be able to digest the engineered tomato that is cooked are you saying engineered raw tomatoes wouldnt digest in the human body that aside back to your quote nigeria has not mechanized our agriculture neither has it created a storage network to stem the fifty percent spoilage rate of farm produce that occurs between the farms to the consumer the media fellow is advocating gmos as the only solution for nigeria he speaks about research what research have nigerian scientist done was it nigerian scientist that created the bt strain monsanto donated for the bt cowpea the answer is no was the transgenic bt cowpea created at the iar zaria no it was created by csiro in australia so the scientist at iar zaria without biosafety laws or public discourse are carrying out field trials with technology they dont have the ability to create test or assess the effects on the humans that will consume them the institute for agricultural research iar in zaria in association with monsanto and csiro in australia have created bt cowpea using genes derived from the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis which was provided by monsanto and combined by csiro and have carried out field trials ezezika dall 2012 it is clear from these experiments and associations that the nigerian scientist and agencies the media fellow speaks about have become planters mere surrogates for experimentation on behalf of monsanto and similar organizations to round it up mr monsanto asks why do media organizations continue to give space to antigmo activists with absolutely no qualifications to rant about the alleged risks of gm seeds which the worlds leading scientific and public health authorities have deemed to be every bit as safe as conventional seeds and foods mr monsanto which scientific and public health authorities ultimately it is the food producer who is responsible for assuring safety — fda statement of policy foods derived from new plant varieties gmo policy federal register vol 57 no 104 1992 p 229 monsanto should not have to vouchsafe the safety of biotech food our interest is in selling as much of it as possible assuring its safety is the fdas job philip angell monsantos director of corporate communications playing god in the garden new york times magazine october 25 1998 clearly there seems to be a huge amount of confusion between you and the fda you really should sort that out a speech made by us rep dennis kucinich on the congress floor in 1992 the food and drug administration decided that genetically modified organisms gmos are the functional equivalent of conventional foods they arrived at this decision without testing gmos for allergenicity toxicity antibiotic resistance and functional characteristics as a result hundreds of millions of acres of gmo crops were planted in america without the knowledge or consent of the american people no safety testing and no longterm health studies the fda has received over a million comments from citizens demanding labeling of gmos ninety percent of americans agree so why no labeling ill give you one reason the influence and the corruption of the political process by monsanto monsanto has been a prime mover in gmo technology a multimillion dollar gmo lobby here and a major political contributor mr monsanto clearly has no problems with a media fellow a journalist publishing his own opinions nor do they have a problem quoting him extensively yet they have an issue with an architects opinion typical but thats expected from a company that sues farmers bullies and sues states like vermont because the people demand their food be labeled all this is to be expected of a company that has a godcomplex with an aim to control our food and claim ownership of seeds with a business model that enslaves farmers people will have roundup ready soya whether they like it or not ann foster spokesperson for monsanto in britain as quoted in the nation magazine from article the politics of food by maria margaronis december 27 1999 issue is it by force listen mr monsanto you cant come to nigeria and bully us in to neocolonialism your ancestors fooled us once with umbrellas and mirrors but it wont happen with your magic seeds i am not sure what our minister of agriculture mr adesina is telling you or who you think we are in this country nigeria will mechanize nigeria will develop and provide for each and every nigerian without your enslavement and without your diseaselinked technology you want qualified commentary right possibly from a scientist right no problem here you go the few scientific researches done on the effects of these foods on humans have showed stunted growth impaired immune systems bleeding stomachs abnormal and potentially precancerous cell growth in the intestines impaired blood cell development misshaped cell structures in the liver pancreas and testicles altered gene expression and cell metabolism liver and kidney lesions partially atrophied livers inflamed kidneys less developed organs reduced digestive enzymes higher blood sugar inflamed lung tissue increased death rates and higher offspring mortality as well after gm soy was introduced in the uk allergies from the product skyrocketed by 50 percent repeated use of seeds like monsantos roundupready soybeans results in vicious new superweeds that need far greater amounts of stronger herbicides to combat their toxic residues remain in crops that humans and animals then eat even small amounts of these toxins are endocrine disruptors that can affect human reproduction adversely most recently tests showed the presence of the herbicide glyphosate widely used with monsantos herbicidetolerant gm soybean and maize varieties in samples of mothers breast milk in the united states says aniebo imagine if a nigerian company behaved in a similar fashion to monsanto and tried to push their dependencyinducing technology through the us senate that company would be labeled a threat to national security one is amazed at the sheer volume of hypocrisy and arrogance this company exudes but its not their fault nigerians are you not tired we drive in cars made by foreigners on roads built by foreigners using phones created by foreigners foreign companies drill our oil then they even help us refine our oil then sell it back to us agriculture the most basic achievement of any civilization the one thing we have that is our own would now be outsourced as well do you not see that while our farmers become dependent on these seeds which they never needed in the first place monsanto and the likes take this revenue back to their country and guess what they do with it they build more laboratories pay scientists salaries make more advancement and make their own countries greater is it so difficult to see that we can never be great if we keep looking for handouts keep being more and more dependent if we keep outsourcing our ability to think to create to innovate all for short term gain we must now decide to invest in ourselves make our own mistakes learn from them in a bid to create an environment for global giants to emerge in nigeria by nigerians for nigerians on our own terms this is more than agriculture it is more than science it is about us as a people deciding to stand it is about not leaving a legacy of slavery and sickness to our children and future generations",

            "text": "Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina recently, on the ministry’s website responded to an article in The Guardian written by Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour on Monsanto, Genetically Modified Foods and why Nigerians should be wary. Also, Monsanto (a publicly traded American multinational agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, USA) has reacted to the articles written by Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour and Ify Aniebo on the subject.\n\n“I read this and was shocked at the level of total misrepresentation. There is nothing correct in all this write up. I normally don’t respond to these kind of things, but feel Gbadebo should be educated on facts. First, Nigeria does not have GMOs. Second, all the seeds used by farmers in Nigeria are from conventional breeding, and we allow farmers to reuse their own seeds. Third, we support biodiversity and promote both in-situ and ex-situ gene banks for ensuring local biodiversity is conserved. Fourth, we promote sensible and responsible use of modern technologies to address complex problems of diseases and pest, climate change and malnutrition.\n\nThe author unfortunately confuses biotechnology with GMOs, which is done to deliberately misinform the population. He does not understand science. Noise is not fact nor science. Through conventional breeding and biotechnology we have safe nutrient enriched crops such as pro-vitamin A cassava, orange-flesh sweet potato, drought resistant maize, flood resistant rice and bananas resistant to virulent black sigatoka disease that can wipe out all of Nigeria’s and Africa’s bananas, and cassava varieties resistant to cassava bacterial blight that can wipe out Africa’s largest source of food. Does he expect us to fold our hands and do nothing and watch poor farmers go into such devastation?\n\nAll the seed companies in Nigeria use conventional breeding. Nigeria is putting in place bio safety laws to regulate use of modern biotechnology. Consumer and environmental safety are priority for us. But we must develop and we must use new technologies. Responsible use of technologies, while managing and preserving biodiversity and the environment and consumer safety is the role of government.\n\nAs Minister of Agriculture for Nigeria, I assure you that this is being done. But we must not become misinformed by those that want Africa to remain backward, with misguided anti-technology views.\n\nTo communicate, you can use mobile phone (despite associated risks with brain cancer) or tie strings to match boxes or use town criers as done in old times. The former is modern technology. I am sure the writer uses mobile phones, yet it has risks! Why not try communicating with matchboxes with strings: after all, it is a safe technology! You can travel by plane or donkey. The former generates C02, but everyone uses it to travel. Why not try traveling to Europe by donkey?\n\nWe must be factual, sensible and responsible in our reporting. Nigeria is working hard to empower its millions of farmers with appropriate technologies to lift them out of poverty into wealth. Over 95% of all our agribusinesses are locally owned companies. I believe in food sovereignty, that is why I am pushing daily for Nigeria to be free from dependence on food imports to feed ourselves. We will feed ourselves with dignity; lift millions of our people out of poverty. But scare mongering with deliberate misinformation as done by Gbadebo and similar anti-technology apologists is not the way to go. His assertions are totally misguided and misinformed.\n\nUnless Africa uses modern technologies, our farmers’ output will remain low and we will remain dependent on others to feed us. That is definitely not the way to have food sovereignty. That will only deepen dependency on others. We must feed ourselves with dignity and we must use appropriate modern technologies to do so, give choices to farmers, while preserving biodiversity, building environmental resilience, robust ecosystems and protecting health and well being of our people.\n\nThat is exactly what we are doing.\n\nWith all due respect, Mr. Adesina’s response aside from being vague and empty has not addressed any concerns raised by my article. In playing politics with the Nigerian people, he has spoken about everything except the ELEPHANT in the room.\n\n“Nigeria does not have GMOs.”\n\nSir, WHAT IS MONSANTO DOING IN NIGERIA? In the month of May 2014, an article titled ‘‘Government okays introduction of 40 hybrid seeds in Nigeria” was published in The Guardian newspaper. Another article titled “Monsanto to introduce 40 new seed varieties,” was also published and Monsanto’s vice president, Michael Frank was quoted as saying that MONSANTO would focus on maize, soybean, cotton and oil-grape seed production in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the NABDA boss (Nigeria Biotechnology Development Agency), Nigeria already has three genetically engineered crops in confined field trial. He names them as BT cowpea in Zaria, the African bio-fortified sorghum also in Zaria and the cassava plus at the National Root Crops Institute at Umudike, Abia State. The Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR) in Zaria in association with Monsanto and CSIRO in Australia have created Bt Cowpea using genes derived from the soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis (which was provided by Monsanto) and have carried out field trials (Ezezika & Dall, 2012).\n\nMr. Minister there is nothing conventional or natural about Monsanto Transgenic modifications, neither is there anything natural about inserting DNA from bacteria into cowpea. It is clear from these experiments and associations that Nigerian agencies and institutes have become mere surrogates for experimentation on behalf of foreign/commercial interests.\n\n“All the seeds used by farmers in Nigeria are from conventional breeding, and we allow farmers to reuse their own seeds”\n\nIs that the Monsanto Model? There are so many case studies around the world that proves that this is not Monsanto’s model. Prof. Iwu had this to say about the Monsanto Model.\n\n“One of the things they do and they do badly is that they will bring these things, they will give our farmers seeds for example and they will plant these seeds. Regardless of whether the seeds are safe or not you cannot replant the seeds the next year. You will go back and start buying from them and after a while there will be total dependency. And these things can be airborne and they can destroy our farms and so on.” Prof. Maurice Iwu, a professor of pharmacognosy at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN)\n\nNnimmo Bassey had this to say about the Monsanto model,\n\n“We cannot be force-fed by a savage biotech industry that seeks to colonize African seeds and food systems. The fact that GMOs will not feed the world is well studied and documented. See the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) report, for example. GMOs will enslave the world through the intellectual property rights that allows the biotech industry to patent their seeds, debars farmers from sharing or saving seeds and forces them to buy seeds every planting season. It seeks to overturn age long sustainable practices.” Nnimmo Bassey Nigerian environmentalist, Chair of Friends of the Earth International 2008-2012\n\nSo, again I ask WHAT IS MONSANTO DOING IN NIGERIA?\n\n“Nigeria is putting in place bio safety laws to regulate use of modern biotechnology. Consumer and environmental safety are priority for us.”\n\nAniebo had this to say about the consumer and environmental safety of Monsanto GMO.\n\n“The few scientific researches done on the effects of these foods on humans have showed stunted growth, impaired immune systems, bleeding stomachs, abnormal and potentially precancerous cell growth in the intestines, impaired blood cell development, misshaped cell structures in the liver, pancreas and testicles, altered gene expression and cell metabolism, liver and kidney lesions, partially atrophied livers, inflamed kidneys, less developed organs, reduced digestive enzymes, higher blood sugar, inflamed lung tissue, increased death rates and higher offspring mortality as well.\n\nAfter GM soy was introduced in the UK, allergies from the product skyrocketed by 50 percent, and in the U.S. in the 1980s, a GM food supplement killed dozens and left five to 10 thousand others sick or disabled. Repeated use of seeds like Monsanto’s Roundup-Ready soybeans results in vicious new super-weeds that need far greater amounts of stronger herbicides to combat. Their toxic residues remain in crops that humans and animals then eat. Even small amounts of these toxins are endocrine disruptors that can affect human reproduction adversely. Most recently, tests showed the presence of the herbicide glyphosate, widely used with Monsanto’s herbicide-tolerant GM soybean and maize varieties, in samples of mothers’ breast milk in the United States.”\n\nIfy Aniebo (B Sc, MSc, MRes, MPH) is a molecular geneticist from Oxford University, with a master’s in public health. She was also recognized by Nigeria’s President Goodluck Jonathan during the centenary celebrations as an inventor and innovator.\n\nAgain I ask: What is Monsanto doing in Nigeria?\n\nThe minister presents the bio-safety law as an infrastructure that would look out for the interest of Nigerians by rigorously testing GMO products to ensure they are safe for consumption as well as the ecosystem. Here is what the Chairman, Senate committee on science and technology, Prof. Robert Boroffice, had to say on the Bio-Safety bill.\n\n“I can speak authoritatively that Mr. President will be anxious to enact a bio-safety law, when he gets the passed bill before him, for the interest of the country, he will sign, So, that Monsanto and other countries can come to Nigeria to assist us in boosting agricultural production not only in food but also in area of cotton, cowpea, maize, tomatoes.”\n\nSomehow before the bill has been passed it is clear Monsanto has Pre-qualified? Is that how a Bio-safety bill should work Mr. Minister? It is clear that this Bio-safety bill is nothing more than a gateway to guarantee Monsanto’s entry in to Nigeria. This coupled with the minister’s framework (which is available online) makes it clear the focus is on big business as opposed to the safety and welfare of the Nigerian people.\n\n“We must not become misinformed by those that want Africa to remain backward, with misguided anti-technology views.”\n\nLet’s see how Monsanto GMO has fared in other parts of the world. In India for example, Monsanto crop failures are linked to the suicides of 300,000 cotton farmers.\n\nAccording to physicist and author Vandana Shiva, Monsanto’s contributions to a “suicide economy” in India, such as an increase in the price per kilogram of cotton seeds from 7 to 17,000 rupees. Shiva lists additional complications:\n\n“Indigenous cotton varieties can be intercropped with food crops. Monsanto’s Bt-cotton can only be grown as a monoculture. Indigenous cotton is rain fed. Bt-cotton needs irrigation. Indigenous varieties are pest resistant. Bt-cotton, even though promoted as resistant to the bollworm, has created new pests, and to control these new pests, farmers are using 13 times more pesticides then they were using prior to introduction of Bt-cotton. And finally, Monsanto sells its GMO seeds on fraudulent claims of yields of 1500/kg/year when farmers harvest 300-400 kg/year on an average.”\n\nAccording to HRH Prince Charles of England:\n\nThe crisis, branded the ‘GM Genocide’ by campaigners, was highlighted recently when Prince Charles claimed that the issue of GM had become a ‘global moral question’ – and the time had come to end its unstoppable march. He condemned ‘the truly appalling and tragic rate of small farmer suicides in India, stemming… from the failure of many Monsanto GM crop varieties.’\n\nIn Brazil, five million Brazilian farmers are locked in a lawsuit with US-based biotech giant Monsanto, suing for as much as 6.2 billion Euros. “Monsanto gets paid when it sell the seeds. The law gives producers the right to multiply the seeds they buy and nowhere in the world is there a requirement to pay (again). Producers are in effect paying a private tax on production,” Jane Berwanger, lawyer for the farmers in the latest installment of the legal battle erupting in South America, the Brazilian court has ruled in favor of the Brazilian farmers, saying Monsanto owes them at least US$2 billion.\n\nSo I ask for the umpteenth time Sir, what is Monsanto doing in Nigeria?\n\nMr. Adesina uses a simplistic analogy to trivialize our health concerns in relation to risks associated with GM technology. He speaks of donkeys and planes, phones and matchboxes.\n\nDr. Adesina, Prof. Borrofice, have two million people marched against the airline industry or one Airline Company? Have two million people marched against the mobile phone industry? The answer is a resounding NO. Two million people all around the world in 436 cities have marched against Monsanto globally protesting the negative health effects and harm their technology does to human beings and the environment. Why? Because the risks associated with this technology far outweighs the benefits.\n\nBut I’ll humour you, let’s say those two million people and everyone I have quoted in this article is anti-science and needs in your words “educating”, Are the 6 countries of the G8 anti-science too?\n\nIs the Technology Powerhouse – Japan anti-science? Yet they banned GMOS and have strong bio-safety laws PREVENTING and INHIBITING the importation of GMO products in to their country. France and Manufacturing powerhouse Germany banned Monsanto cultivation and GMO products. Italy banned cultivation of Monsanto and GM products. England does not allow cultivation of Monsanto crops and only allows GM products in to the country as animal feed and even this is under scrutiny. Lastly, the world super power Russia banned all Monsanto products as well as GM products entering the country.\n\nIn the words of the Russian Prime minister, Medvedev\n\n“If the Americans like to eat GMO products, let them eat it then. We don’t need to do that; we have enough space and opportunities to produce organic food,”\n\nWhile our Minister and Senator are trying to pass a bill to allow Monsanto to come in to Nigeria, Russia is passing a bill to treat producers of biotech crops from companies such as Monsanto, The Dow Chemical Company, and Syngenta as criminals, with fines comparable to terrorism. As co-author of the bill Kirill Cherkasov said,\n\n”When a terrorist act is committed, only several people are usually hurt. But GMOs may hurt dozens and hundreds. The consequences are much worse. And punishment should be proportionate to the crime.”\n\nSo the question remains and I ask again: What Is Monsanto doing in Nigeria?\n\nMr. Minister, Mr. Senator, Do you have as robust infrastructure as Russia, Japan or France? Do you plan to set it up overnight? Do you have the scientific infrastructure to monitor Monsanto? Mr. Minister you clearly need to educate the leaders of all these great nations as well once you are done educating me. Do you have more scientists at your disposal than France, Germany or Japan? Or are we basing our policy on America and what America tells us is safe? A nation, which is controlled by ‘Profit at any cost corporations’?\n\nA speech made by US Rep Dennis Kucinich on the house of congress floor:\n\n“In 1992 the Food and Drug Administration decided that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are the functional equivalent of conventional foods. They arrived at this decision without testing GMOs for allergenicity, toxicity, anti-biotic resistance and functional characteristics. As a result hundreds of millions of acres of GMO crops were planted in America without the knowledge or consent of the American people: no safety testing and no long-term health studies. The FDA (America’s version of NAFDAC) has received over a million comments from citizens demanding labelling of GMOs. Ninety percent of Americans agree. So, why no labelling? I’ll give you one reason: The influence and the corruption of the political process by Monsanto. Monsanto has been a prime mover in GMO technology, a multi-million dollar GMO lobby here and a major political contributor.’\n\n“Unless Africa uses modern technologies, our farmers’ output will remain low and we will remain dependent on others to feed us”\n\nOn this I agree with Mr. Minister, So I ask, Sir have you fully mechanized the Nigerian Agriculture sector? Do farmers have access to funding in the form of soft loans? Of all the money purportedly set aside for the agricultural sector, how many farmers have ACTUALLY accessed those funds? How is Nigeria doing with regards to the Maputo declaration? You clearly have a reference for what optimum productivity should be… do Nigerian farmers get subsidized like their European or American counterparts? Do they? Yet according to the IMF, in its largest countries by agricultural output at Purchasing Power Parity, Nigeria is ranked No 5, second to the USA which is ranked No 4 and all this was achieved without machinery and without access to funds or subsidies like their American counterparts.\n\nClearly giving them all that is too much work, so you propose magic seeds? Nigeria is dependent on imports not only due to previous issues raised, but also the fact that we do not process our products e.g. rice. Till today Nigeria a nation is boasting about$900million revenue from the export of raw cocoa. Raw Cocoa in the 21st century, Cocoa has made men fortunes since the 1800s yet we still export raw cocoa. Mars Inc made $30billion annual turnover and that is just one chocolate company. Ignoring all the byproducts of Cocoa processing surely it would make a lot more sense for Nigeria to at least process her cocoa?\n\nNigerian leadership has to evolve from its Fire brigade paradigm in which it favors Corporations and special interest to exploit the nation at the detriment of its people. Case in point, The Niger Delta people complained for years concerning the destruction of their land, their waters, they could not feed themselves. Leadership ignored their calls. Champions of their cause lost their lives. Nigeria behaved as though the oil was for Nigeria but the oil spill was for the Niger delta. It was only when these people after years of complaints took up guns that Nigerian leadership paid attention. Today we pay billions in amnesty every year. What would it have cost Nigeria to listen back then? To have enforced oil companies to clean up and do the right thing as they do in their own countries? Would it not have been cheaper for Nigeria on the long run? We are paying this price in the North currently because leaders have put selfish interest above those of the Nigerian people.\n\nArgentina the poster child of Monsanto is currently experiencing what I just spoke of. Research released from communities around farms where Monsanto is implementing its technology showed an increase in risk for defects at birth due to exposure to pesticides in mothers. The specific defects included were limb reduction, urogenital anomalies, CNS defects, or facial clefts, heart conditions, and ocular defects.\n\nSo again I ask: What Are Monsanto And The Likes Doing In Nigeria?\n\nWhen full mechanization of Nigerian agriculture is achieved, extension service to farmers increased to meet world standards and farmers have access to loans, Nigeria will feed herself independently without the need to resort to GMO.\n\nMonsanto and the likes have no business in Nigeria and the Bio-safety Bill should not be passed because it is merely a charade to get Monsanto into the country. I tell you why two million people march against Monsanto and not cell phone companies. Food and water are the most basic requirements for human life. God in his wisdom made our sources of food renewable. Monsanto through its patent laws and systems seeks to own, control and charge for what has been given to us freely. This makes Nigeria dependent on foreign biotech firms to feed. So Mr. Minister there is no confusion here, this is what we stand against. The fact that six out of the eight countries that make up the G8 have banned the cultivation of GM foods for consumption in their own countries but formed an alliance to promote and fund this initiative in our country is something every Nigerian needs to ponder on.\n\nOn June 6, Monsanto responded to Rhodes-Vivour’s article (earlier published in The Guardian) on their blog (http://monsantoblog.eu/nigerian-paper-sows-misinformation-on-gm-and-hybrid-seeds/) in a post titled -Nigerian paper sows misinformation on GM and hybrid seeds.\n\nWhy we must reject Monsanto’s Trojan horse, R-Vivour.\n\nMonsanto and its imperial agents such as a Mr. Abdallah el-Kurebe disappointingly don’t address any concerns raised instead focus on the fact that I am an architect.\n\nMonsanto says: “Let’s leave aside the obvious question of whether architects, however qualified, should be considered authorities on anything other than building design.”\n\nTo Monsanto and Mr. Kurebe, I ask: Did Awolowo study education? Or was he a teacher? No, yet we know his effect on the educational system. Did Obasanjo study agriculture or farming? Yet we know his success as a farmer and I won’t talk about the late great Ibrahim Tahir (Talba of Bauchi). Attacking the messenger from the onset shows the inferiority and weakness of your argument.\n\nMr. Monsanto, after belittling my article as a ‘rant’, speaks about a statement I made with regards to genetically modified tomatoes. “Many of the accusations in Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour’s rant lack any credible substantiation, or are just downright bizarre. For example, his claim that biotech tomatoes (which don’t exist, btw) can become toxic and cause cancer.”\n\nYES, they don’t exist now, but Mr. Monsanto conveniently does not mention why.\n\nThe first commercially available genetically modified food was a tomato engineered to have a longer shelf life (the Flavr Savr).\n\n“Rats fed genetically engineered Calgene Flavr-Savr tomatoes (developed to look fresh for weeks) for 28 days got bleeding stomachs (stomach lesions) and seven died and were replaced in the study.” Food Safety–Contaminants and Toxins. Reviewed in J.P.F. D’Mello, CABI Publishing, 2003.\n\nIn October 1991, Dr. Edwin Mathews from the Department of Health and Human Services and of the FDA’s Toxicology Group wrote to the FDA Biotechnology Working Group saying: “Genetically modified plants could also contain unexpected high concentrations of plant toxicants”.\n\nIn a memo dated 16 June 1993 to Linda Kahl, Consumer Safety Officer at the Food and Drug Administration - FDA (America’s version of NAFDAC), Fred Hines, Staff Pathologist at the FDA wrote: “There is considerable disparity in the reported findings of gastric erosions or necrosis lesions from the three studies provided by Calgene Inc. This disparity has not been adequately addressed or explained by the sponsor or the laboratory where the study was conducted’\n\nIn 1994, Dr. Joseph Cummins, Emeritus Professor of Genetics at the University of West-Ontario warned that “the inclusion in Flavr Savr tomatoes of a genetic sequence from the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus could create virulent new viruses. “\n\nEventually due to safety concerns and economic failure, the modified tomato was taken off the market. Mr. Monsanto, that’s a WHOLE LOT of history to conveniently leave out don’t you think?\n\nBelow is Monsanto’s ‘copy and paste’ response to every negative complaint or tragedy their technology brings to people all over the world from Argentina all the way to India and South Africa.\n\n‘’Roundup® brand agricultural herbicides have a long history of safe use when used according to label directions in more than 100 countries around the world. Comprehensive toxicological studies have demonstrated that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup® branded agricultural herbicides does not cause birth defects or reproductive problems.”\n\nSafe use right? Long history right? Let’s talk about the safety and long history of a product you also produced and told the world was safe for a long period of time -DDT\n\nIn 1944, Monsanto became one of the first manufacturers of the insecticide DDT to combat malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Despite decades of Monsanto propaganda insisting that DDT was safe, the true effects of DDT’s toxicity were at last confirmed through Independent research and in 1972, DDT was banned throughout America. Today, it is common knowledge that DDT causes cancer. But back in the 1940s, Monsanto told us it was safe.\n\nWith regards to the 300,000 farmer suicides in India, Monsanto does as a typical Brutish American corporation does, similar to the NRA (National Rifle Association) justifies gun ownership after a mass shooting in America, ‘Parents buy more guns to protect yourself from your 10 year old, teachers should too’ or ‘Gun violence is caused by video games, music and movies’.\n\nSomehow it would seem mass killings are caused by everything except the guns, I digress.\n\nThe real reason for farmer suicides are failed promises of Monsanto, the creation of pest resistance, expensive seeds and the need for a larger amount of water relative to natural varieties. Bt cotton was a failure, but guess what? Monsanto had been paid for their magic seeds, so while their books recorded profit, farmers were dying in debt.\n\nAccording to physicist and author Vandana Shiva, Monsanto’s contributions to a “suicide economy” in India, such as an increase in the price per kilogram of cotton seeds from 7 to 17,000 rupees. Shiva lists additional complications:\n\n“Indigenous cotton varieties can be intercropped with food crops. Bt-cotton can only be grown as a monoculture. Indigenous cotton is rain fed. Bt-cotton needs irrigation. Indigenous varieties are pest resistant. Bt-cotton, even though promoted as resistant to the bollworm, has created new pests, and to control these new pests, farmers are using 13 times more pesticides then they were using prior to introduction of Bt-cotton. And finally, Monsanto sells its GMO seeds on fraudulent claims of yields of 1500/kg/year when farmers harvest 300-400 kg/year on an average.”\n\nThey quoted their Imperial agent Mr. Abdallah el-Kurebe extensively but this one quote is a true gem:\n\n“That the country’s subsistence agriculture can no longer supply the needs of its growing population is undoubtedly true. This is the very reason for the country’s adoption of agricultural biotechnology and the biosafety law seeks to provide the framework for Nigerian scientists who have done much research to move forward from field trials into commercial testing phases for eventual deployment to farmers,” Mr. Abdallah el-Kurebe a “Media Fellow” of Agricultural Biosciences.\n\nMr. Media Fellow, apart from interviewing people and recording what they tell you, have you done any critical research? I mean according to you “The human body would always be able to “digest” the engineered tomato that is cooked.” Are you saying engineered raw tomatoes wouldn’t digest in the human body? That aside back to your quote. Nigeria has not mechanized our agriculture; neither has it created a storage network to stem the fifty percent spoilage rate of farm produce that occurs between the farms to the consumer. The media fellow is advocating GMOs as the only solution for Nigeria, he speaks about research, what research have Nigerian scientist done? Was it Nigerian scientist that created the Bt strain Monsanto donated for the Bt cowpea? The answer is NO. Was the transgenic Bt Cowpea created at the IAR Zaria? NO, it was created by CSIRO in Australia. So, the scientist at (IAR) Zaria without Bio-safety laws or public discourse are carrying out field trials with technology they don’t have the ability to create, test or assess the effects on the humans that will consume them.\n\nThe Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR) in Zaria in association with Monsanto and CSIRO in Australia have created Bt Cowpea using genes derived from the bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis  (which was provided by Monsanto and combined by CSIRO) and have carried out field trials (Ezezika & Dall, 2012).\n\nIt is clear from these experiments and associations that the Nigerian scientist and agencies the “media fellow” speaks about have become planters, mere surrogates for experimentation on behalf of Monsanto and similar organizations.\n\nTo round it up, Mr. Monsanto asks  “Why do media organizations continue to give space to anti-GMO activists with absolutely no qualifications to rant about the alleged risks of GM seeds, which the world’s leading scientific and public health authorities have deemed to be every bit as safe as conventional seeds and foods?”\n\n“Ultimately, it is the food producer who is responsible for assuring safety” — FDA, “Statement of Policy: Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties” (GMO Policy), Federal Register, Vol. 57, No. 104 (1992), p. 229\n\n“Monsanto should not have to vouchsafe the safety of biotech food. Our interest is in selling as much of it as possible. Assuring its safety is the F.D.A.’s job” - Philip Angell, Monsanto’s director of corporate communications. “Playing God in the Garden” New York Times Magazine, October 25, 1998.\n\nClearly, there seems to be a HUGE AMOUNT of confusion between you and the FDA, you really should sort that out.\n\nA speech made by US Rep Dennis Kucinich on the Congress floor:\n\n“In 1992 the Food and Drug Administration decided that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are the functional equivalent of conventional foods. They arrived at this decision without testing GMOs for allergenicity, toxicity, anti-biotic resistance and functional characteristics. As a result hundreds of millions of acres of GMO crops were planted in America without the knowledge or consent of the American people: no safety testing and no long-term health studies. The FDA has received over a million comments from citizens demanding labeling of GMOs. Ninety percent of Americans agree. So, why no labeling? I’ll give you one reason: The influence and the corruption of the political process by Monsanto. Monsanto has been a prime mover in GMO technology, a multi-million dollar GMO lobby here and a major political contributor.”\n\nMr. Monsanto clearly has no problems with a ‘Media Fellow’ (a journalist) publishing his own opinions nor do they have a problem quoting him extensively yet they have an issue with an Architect’s opinion.\n\nTypical, but that’s expected from a company that sues farmers, bullies and sues states like Vermont because the people demand their food be labeled. All this is to be expected of a company that has a God-complex, with an aim to control our food and claim ownership of seeds with a business model that enslaves farmers.\n\n“People will have Roundup Ready soya whether they like it or not” - Ann Foster, spokesperson for Monsanto in Britain, as quoted in The Nation magazine from article “The Politics of Food” by Maria Margaronis December 27, 1999 issue.\n\nIs it by force?\n\nListen, Mr. Monsanto, you can’t come to Nigeria and bully us in to neo-colonialism. Your ancestors fooled us once with umbrellas and mirrors but it won’t happen with your magic seeds. I am not sure what our Minister of agriculture, Mr. Adesina is telling you or who you think we are in this country.\n\nNigeria will mechanize, Nigeria will develop and provide for each and every Nigerian without your enslavement and without your disease-linked technology.\n\nYou want ‘qualified’ commentary right, possibly from a scientist right? No problem, here you go:\n\n“The few scientific researches done on the effects of these foods on humans have showed stunted growth, impaired immune systems, bleeding stomachs, abnormal and potentially precancerous cell growth in the intestines, impaired blood cell development, misshaped cell structures in the liver, pancreas and testicles, altered gene expression and cell metabolism, liver and kidney lesions, partially atrophied livers, inflamed kidneys, less developed organs, reduced digestive enzymes, higher blood sugar, inflamed lung tissue, increased death rates and higher offspring mortality as well.\n\nAfter GM soy was introduced in the UK, allergies from the product skyrocketed by 50 percent. Repeated use of seeds like Monsanto’s Roundup-Ready soybeans results in vicious new super-weeds that need far greater amounts of stronger herbicides to combat. Their toxic residues remain in crops that humans and animals then eat. Even small amounts of these toxins are endocrine disruptors that can affect human reproduction adversely. Most recently, tests showed the presence of the herbicide glyphosate, widely used with Monsanto’s herbicide-tolerant GM soybean and maize varieties, in samples of mothers’ breast milk in the United States,” says Aniebo.\n\nImagine if a Nigerian company behaved in a similar fashion to Monsanto and tried to push their dependency-inducing technology through the US Senate. That company would be labeled a threat to national security. One is amazed at the sheer volume of hypocrisy and arrogance this company exudes, but it’s not their fault.\n\nNigerians, are you not tired? We drive in cars made by foreigners on roads built by foreigners using phones created by foreigners. Foreign companies drill our oil then they even “help” us refine our oil then sell it back to us.\n\nAgriculture the most basic achievement of any civilization, the one thing we have that is our own would now be outsourced as well? Do you not see that while our farmers become dependent on these seeds, which they never needed in the first place, Monsanto and the likes take this revenue back to their country and guess what they do with it? They build more laboratories, pay scientists salaries, make more advancement and make their own countries greater. Is it so difficult to see that we can never be great if we keep looking for handouts, keep being more and more dependent? If we keep outsourcing our ability to think, to create, to innovate, all for short term gain. We must now decide to invest in ourselves, make our own mistakes; learn from them in a bid to create an environment for global giants to emerge in Nigeria, by Nigerians for Nigerians on our own terms. This is more than agriculture. It is more than science. It is about us as a people deciding to stand. It is about not leaving a legacy of slavery and sickness to our children and future generations.",

to stigmatize gmo foods by judy kent article source httpwwwnationalcenterorgprsafewaygmos072814html washington dc pleasanton ca – at the annual meeting of safeway shareholders this past friday in pleasanton california the overwhelming majority of shareholders followed the advice of the national center for public policy research and rejected an antiscientific shareholder proposal that would have forced the grocery store chain to brand products containing geneticallymodified organisms gmos with labels the purpose of the mandatorylabeling campaign is to deter the sale of products containing gmos by frightening consumers unnecessarily safeways shareholders sent a loud message to the gmo activists and lobbyists that represent them – science trumps baseless fearmongering campaigns said national center free enterprise project director justin danhof esq danhof spoke out against a proposal submitted by the green century equity fund that sought to require the company to identify and label all of its products that may contain genetically engineered ingredients in the face of all of the uncontroverted scientific evidence that gmos are safe the proponent of the gmolabeling proposal had the temerity to tell safeways shareholders that no longterm scientific evidence exists to show that gmo foods are safe noted danhof this is beyond willful ignorance some antigmo activists are shameless in their attempt to advance their agenda danhof countered the proposal by noting in part this proposal is unscientific unnecessary for safeways business purposes and would increase food prices disproportionately harming lowerincome customers numerous scientific bodies have determined that gmo foods are safe including 1 the national academy of sciences 2 the american association for the advancement of science which has stated that the science is quite clear crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe 3 the american medical association which has stated that bioengineered foods have been consumed for 20 years and during that time no overt consequences on human health have been reported andor substantiated in the peerreviewed literature 4 the royal society of medicine 5 the world health organization the european union spent ten years and hundreds of millions of euros to exhaustively examine gmos determining the main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects covering a period of more than 25 years of research and involving more than 500 independent research groups is that biotechnology and in particular gmos are not per se more risky than eg conventional plant breeding technologies the proposal can be found on pages 241 and 242 of safeways proxy statement danhofs full statement against the proposal as prepared for delivery can be found here the proposal failed with only 1025 percent of company shareholders voting for it if gmos are so bad and causing the human devastation that activists claim why are groups such as the green century equity fund only calling for labeling asked danhof if the science backed up its scary claims it would be calling for an outright ban and if the science backed them up i expect i might join with them but the wild claims of the antigmo crowd have no scientific backing and simply rely on fear fridays meeting marks the fourth time during the 2014 shareholder season that the national center urged corporate america to do more to combat the assault from antigmo activists which is in part funded by the organic food industry in late january danhof urged monsanto shareholders to reject another antiscientific proposal that sought to have the company work with the food and drug administration to advance gmo labeling as national center chairman amy ridenour said at the time its easy for relatively wellfed americans to overlook the tremendous promise of gmos as a tool to combat malnutrition and hunger worldwide yet the demonization of geneticallymodified foods could have a tragic result if it stops or slows the use of seeds that improve agricultural yields and nutrition in the third world gmos are even more environmentfriendly than traditional farming as gmos are safe why surrender the benefits like safeway shareholders monsanto shareholders overwhelmingly agreed with the national center and soundly rejected the proposal danhof also urged monsanto executives to make the companys scientists and health experts more available to the press to combat the highlevel of misinformation and pseudoscience from antigmo zealots that pervades the gmo debate as noted by the wall street journal following the meeting monsanto ceo hugh grant agreed with danhof saying that its a really good idea and that the company needs to do more to win the gmo debate in may danhof attended the kraft foods and pepsi shareholder meetings to urge them to do more to combat the fearmongering and deceptive narratives of antigmo special interests at krafts meeting in glenview illinois danhof noted that by using fear antigmo activist groups seek to confuse and successfully scare much of the public he stated the antigmo attacks come from americans who have likely never missed a meal in their lives their campaigns against gmos are unscientific fearbased and inhumane but they are winning in fact one abc news poll showed that 93 percent of americans think the federal government should mandate gmo labeling – a tactic they hope will elevate gmos with taboo products such as tobacco and alcohol danhof then asked krafts ceo to explain how much gmo labeling laws would increase food prices explain the environmental benefits of gmos and explain the potential lifesaving benefits they hold for thirdworld consumers i dont need to tell you or your food experts all the benefits of gmos but we firmly believe it would be strongly in the companys best interest – and the publics best interest – if kraft stepped up its efforts to educate the american public about them following the meeting danhof said that he was encouraged by kraft ceo tony vernons response to my question about gmos vernon said that the company and the national center are on common ground when it comes to the issue of gmos he thanked me for my question and said that i stated the case for the promise of gmos eloquently vernon is very passionate about the gmo issue and the benefits gmos hold for the environment and public health he agreed that the company must do more to engage and win this public policy debate he noted that gmos are in so much of what everyone in the meeting has been eating for the past 25 years and are perfectly safe he pledged that in the coming months the industry and kraft would be much more vocal and aggressive in speaking about the many benefits of gmos when danhof arrived at the pepsi meeting the following day in new bern north carolina multiple executives from the companys government relations department approached him to discuss the gmo issue they explained to him how they were engaging with stakeholders – including key players in washington dc – to better explain the health and environmental benefits of gmos they informed danhof that kraft executives reached out to pepsis staff the previous afternoon to get some more information on the factsheets and beneficial information that pepsi had already produced so that they may be able to make good on their ceos commitment to the national centers danhof this experience bolsters what we already know – that the free enterprise project gets results while some of those results such as general electric amending its corporate policy on green initiatives received wide publicity others such as the kraftpepsi communication mostly go unseen but are nonetheless vital toward advancing a proliberty agenda said danhof at the pepsi meeting danhof pointed out that antigmo sentiment – fueled by welltodo westerners – caused genuine human suffering and death elsewhere he noted that scientific american recently reported that the delayed application of vitamin aenhanced golden rice thanks to controversies stirred by antigmo activists had cost over 14 million life years in india alone since 2002 this is real human suffering and death and it is children who too often suffer the most following the meeting danhof reported pepsi ceo indra nooyi saying the company planned to use its resources to work with the food and drug administration to get the word out about highyield crops she believes the fda has a responsibility and a duty to educate the american people about food ingredients and safety she also recognized the powerful role the national center can play in public education through our broad outreach efforts and engagement with other food and beverage corporations",

            "text": "David Bronner, President of Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soap, is an organic industry pioneer and outspoken genetically engineered food labeling activist. David and his brother Michael established Dr. Bronner’s as a trendsetter in the organic body care industry by becoming one of the first brands to certify its soaps, lotions and balms under the USDA National Organic Program in 2003 — marking the beginning of Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soaps’ issue-oriented activism in the natural products marketplace. We had the pleasure of interviewing him about the incredible work he’s done on the GE labeling front, check it out.\n\nQ&A: Right to Know Champion, David Bronner, Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soap\n\nQ: What made you first become passionate about the issue of genetically engineered food, and advocating for mandatory labeling?\n\nA: At Dr. Bronner’s we are passionate about organic agriculture, and are one of very few personal care companies whose entire product range is certified under USDA’s National Organic Program standards, the same program that certifies food. Organic versus conventional agriculture is about building soil health and tilth naturally and sustainably, without the petrochemical pesticides and fertilizers that destroy our soil and pollute our food, water and bodies. While genetic engineering could be a beneficial technology in principle, as applied to agriculture it’s been a disaster. Far from freeing us from the chemical treadmill of conventional industrial agriculture, it’s now on steroids. Only two genetically engineered traits are in widespread commercial use: herbicide resistance, so that huge amounts of herbicide can be sprayed on food crops, and crops that produce their own insecticide. Both have the entirely foreseeable effect of exerting massive selection pressure on weeds and pests to develop resistance, much like overdosing factory farmed densely confined animals with antibiotics is causing resistance in virulent strains of bacteria. Pesticide use has predictably skyrocketed as weeds and pests gain resistance, which is great for the giant chemical companies that engineer the seeds to resist their chemicals and sell the chemicals, but not for anybody else. Labeling GMOs would give consumers that right to choose if they want to buy a genetically engineered food or not. It is a no-brainer: we need complete transparency in order for consumers to be able to make an informed choice about the products they are buying and the kind of agriculture they want to support.\n\nQ: From a business perspective how hard would it be for companies to label the presence of GE ingredients in their products?\n\nA: It would not be hard at all. Companies change their labels all the time (including Dr. Bronner’s) and not once has that meant we raised prices to our customers. It’s so dumb. Further, U.S. food companies already label in 64 countries that require GMOs to be disclosed, including all of the European Union and Japan, and food costs have not gone up in those countries.\n\nQ: Do you think there are any potential benefits to biotechnology?\n\nA: Definitely I appreciate the fact that we can produce medicines like insulin via genetically engineered microorganisms, versus grinding up cow pancreases. And theoretically in agriculture, drought tolerance or nitrogen fixing would be great. Unfortunately these are complex genetic traits and they have so far been commercial failures. People need to focus on the facts on the ground versus make-believe: over 99% of GMO crop acreage is engineered to resist and/or produce pesticides. And the resulting widespread weed and pest resistance means that even more pesticides are being blasted on our food and farmlands.\n\nQ: As a company, what has Dr. Bronner’s done to support GE labeling?\n\nA: We financially support diverse NGOs (including Just Label It) dedicated to organic sustainable agriculture, who are opposed to the disaster of genetic engineering in agriculture. We were an early major supporter of California’s Prop 37, a GMO labeling initiative that was voted on in 2012. Despite being outspent $45 to $9 million by the opposition, we almost won that election, 49-51. In 2013 we were heavily involved in Washington State’s 522 Initiative for GMO labeling. We were the largest contributor to the campaign, giving almost 2 million dollars to try to get it passed. We also experimented with having a special label on our soaps for the first time, to inform consumers about the issue. We were still vastly outspent by the opposition, and again, narrowly defeated, 49-51. The movement, on the one hand, made a mistake trying to pass a measure in an odd-year electorate which is much smaller, older and more conservative. On the other, we kept the pressure on in the larger culture and fight, that helped pave the way to the major 2014 victories in Vermont and Jackson County, Oregon. We also were major donors to the Vermont effort, giving over $300K over the past three years, as well as $40K to Jackson county’s fight. We support various state and national efforts, but this year we are very excited that the Oregon Right to Know GMO effort is going to ride the momentum off Vermont and Jackson county, and break open the dam for states everywhere to enact labeling. Things are lined up there with a very favorable and informed electorate, and a terrific and experienced campaign team. And we are once again going to do a special GMO info label on our soaps.\n\nQ: Do you personally try to avoid eating GE foods? How?\n\nA: I eat organic foods as much as possible. By definition, organic food cannot contain any genetically engineered ingredients. To be clear, simply because something is not GE, doesn’t mean it isn’t coated in pesticides and grown in a completely unsustainable manner. Only organic delivers the full sustainable deal.\n\nQ: Who do you admire for their leadership on GE labeling?\n\nA: Ronnie Cummins of the Organic Consumers Association takes names and kicks ass like no other; Andy Kimbrell founder of Center for Food Safety has been a crucial leader and strategist for the movement. Rather than try to list all the rock stars and miss anyone I’ll just say there’s a lot more on the spectrum rocking hard across the board in this movement.\n\nQ: What other causes are you involved with?\n\nA: We’re passionate about fair trade – while organic certification addresses the environmental side of farming and production, it does not touch the social side. Migrant workers in California don’t get any better wages or working conditions in organic fields, although it’s great they’re not being doused with pesticides. We also are active in reforming drug policy in this country, to take a more humane rational approach, such as re-commercializing industrial hemp and legalizing medical marijuana for patients. Those who are addicted and abuse drugs should get treatment; we should not be destroying otherwise productive nonviolent citizens and their families with jail time and records. And we’ve recently opened up an animal rights front, fighting with allies for animal husbandry regulation to stop meat and dairy products from being produced under such poor conditions.\n\nQ: What would you say to others who are hoping to start and lead a movement around positive change?\n\nA: Go for it. Be ready to make a lot of mistakes and learn by doing. And any leader is only really as good as his or her team – so surround yourself with people who complement your skills and who have your back.\n\nQ: Would you recommend any good resources for others hoping to learn more about GMOs?\n\nA: Just Label It is a fantastic resource for updates and how to engage and help at the national level, as well as finding your local state effort and battles and plugging in. GMO Inside is also doing excellent work as well to educate folks on the issue.",

produced into perpetuity the farmers claim that monsanto unfairly collects exorbitant profits every year worldwide on royalties from renewal seed harvests renewal crops are those that have been planted using seed from the previous years harvest while the practice of renewal farming is an ancient one monsanto disagrees demanding royalties from any crop generation produced from its geneticallyengineered seed because the engineered seed is patented monsanto not only charges an initial royalty on the sale of the crop produced but a continuing 2 per cent royalty on every subsequent crop even if the farmer is using a later generation of seed monsanto gets paid when it sell the seeds the law gives producers the right to multiply the seeds they buy and nowhere in the world is there a requirement to pay again producers are in effect paying a private tax on production jane berwanger lawyer for the farmers told the associated press reports in the latest installment of the legal

either use gm seeds and pay monsanto of course or grow nothing now monsanto is after all the generations of crops that can come from any of its once purchased seeds its not a simple matter of dont purchase monsanto seeds either monsanto claims crosspollination by insects wind or even a neighboring farm gives them the right to royalties they have sued hundreds of farmers who have never even used monsanto seeds the insanity of this is hard to comprehend one commentator said im an american monsanto is the devil i dont believe in god but i believe monsanto is the actual devil i really hope this becomes an international trend is it possible to have an international lawsuit and include american farmers in this i agree — on all points monsanto is the devil incarnate the world does not need monsanto their brand of tyranny is the hold the entire population of the earth hostage paying tribute to their incessant demands while they poison us all some countries have attempted to ban monsanto from selling their gmo seeds only to find themselves victims of militarystyle trade wars the united states of course is very much behind monsanto but then again their willing to allow damned near anything into the food supply in this country while the corruption of the company is now well out in the open the fact that the crop was approved shows how deeply rooted monsanto is within the us government especially with a major head of the fda being a leading monsanto employee former monsanto employees currently hold positions in us government agencies such as the food and drug administration fda united states environmental protection agency epa and the supreme court these include clarence thomas michael r taylor ann veneman linda fisher michael friedman william d

what she writes these days shes dead wrong many people hate the epa environmental protection agency but oftentimes it seems without real cause they managed to get ddt out of the united states and the clean water act passed and so much more i shudder to think where wed be without them as companies like monsanto simply dont give twoshits about what theyre putting into the environment and the food chain as usual the motives are always profits and control the bau model of empire and existence endurance that has come to define every moment of our lives a global boycott wont do anything other then raise public awareness of what is going on with farmers throughout the world and how monsanto is trying to gain control over it all on a personal level dont buy anything monsanto or from a subsidiary

            "text": "After reading this article, the need for a global boycott of all things Monsanto needs to be embraced by every country, every citizen, every farmer.\n\nMonsanto believes once a single crop is produced from its seeds (purchased by the farmer), that it owns a percentage of ALL the crops ever produced into perpetuity.\n\nThe farmers claim that Monsanto unfairly collects exorbitant profits every year worldwide on royalties from “renewal” seed harvests. “Renewal” crops are those that have been planted using seed from the previous year’s harvest. While the practice of renewal farming is an ancient one, Monsanto disagrees, demanding royalties from any crop generation produced from its genetically-engineered seed. Because the engineered seed is patented, Monsanto not only charges an initial royalty on the sale of the crop produced, but a continuing 2 per cent royalty on every subsequent crop, even if the farmer is using a later generation of seed.\n\n“Monsanto gets paid when it sell the seeds. The law gives producers the right to multiply the seeds they buy and nowhere in the world is there a requirement to pay (again). Producers are in effect paying a private tax on production,” Jane Berwanger, lawyer for the farmers told the Associated Press reports.\n\nIn the latest installment of the legal battle erupting in South America, the Brazilian court has ruled in favor of the Brazilian farmers, saying Monsanto owes them at least US$2 billion paid since 2004. Monsanto, however, has appealed the decision and the case is ongoing.\n\nIn essence, Monsanto argues that once a farmer buys their seed, they have to pay the global bio-tech giant a yearly fee in perpetuity – with no way out.\n\nMonsanto is a company I’ve come to truly despise as I read more and more of their rape and bully of farmers throughout the world.\n\nDoes everyone remember the quarter-million suicides caused by Monsanto in India among farmers? If you don’t, take the time to look it up.\n\nMonsanto is also the ag-giant behind most of the GM (genetically modified) seeds being forced on us all. In some cases, farmers have absolutely no choice, either use GM seeds (and pay Monsanto of course) or grow nothing.\n\nNow Monsanto is after all the generations of crops that can come from any of its once purchased seeds.\n\nIt’s not a simple matter of “don’t purchase Monsanto seeds” either.  Monsanto claims “cross-pollination” by insects, wind, or even a neighboring farm gives them the right to royalties. They have sued hundreds of farmers who have never even used Monsanto seeds.\n\nThe insanity of this is hard to comprehend. One commentator said:\n\nI’m an American. Monsanto is the devil. I don’t believe in God, but I believe Monsanto is the actual devil.\n\n i really hope this becomes an international trend.\n\n is it possible to have an international lawsuit and include american farmers in this?\n\nI agree — on all points. Monsanto is the devil incarnate. The world does not need Monsanto. Their brand of tyranny is the hold the entire population of the Earth hostage, paying tribute to their incessant demands while they poison us all.\n\nSome countries have attempted to ban Monsanto from selling their GMO seeds, only to find themselves victims of ‘military-style trade wars’.\n\nThe United States of course, is very much behind Monsanto, but then again, their willing to allow damned near anything into the food supply in this country.\n\nWhile the corruption of the company is now well out in the open, the fact that the crop was approved shows how deeply rooted Monsanto is within the U.S. government, especially with a major head of the FDA being a leading Monsanto employee.\n\nFormer Monsanto employees currently hold positions in US government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Supreme Court. These include Clarence Thomas, Michael R. Taylor, Ann Veneman, Linda Fisher, Michael Friedman, William D. Ruckelshaus, and Mickey Kantor.[27] Linda Fisher has been back and forth between positions at Monsanto and the EPA.  Essentially, Monsanto has a strong hand behind any possible threat that could ever be levied against it.\n\nMonsanto is into “everything food”, including cows, bees, milk, herbicides, pesticides, glysophospate, recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone, PCB’s, animal feed, terminator seeds, chemicals, plastics and much, much more like aspartame, a true poison labeled a “sweetener”, linked to brain damage, autism, MS and more.  You could probably assume that if it’s killing us, poisoning us or destroying the environment, Monsanto is behind it.\n\nRemember DDT?  A “bioaccumulate” Monsanto curse upon every living thing, lasting decades in living tissue.  Devvy Kidd tried to tell me that DDT was “safe”, but like much of what she writes these days, she’s dead wrong.\n\nMany people hate the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) but oftentimes it seems without real cause. They managed to get DDT out of the United States and the Clean Water Act passed and so much more. I shudder to think where we’d be without them, as companies like Monsanto simply don’t give two-shits about what they’re putting into the environment and the food chain. As usual, the motives are always profits and control, the BAU model of Empire and ‘existence’ (endurance) that has come to define every moment of our lives.\n\nA global boycott won’t do anything other then raise public awareness of what is going on with farmers throughout the world and how Monsanto is trying to gain control over it all.\n\nOn a personal level, don’t buy anything Monsanto or from a subsidiary of Monsanto.\n\nDon’t eat anything Monsanto either, if you can help it, you’ll undoubtedly live longer.",

            "text": "Brazilian farmers say their GMO corn is no longer resistant to pests, Reuters reported Monday.\n\nThe Association of Soybean and Corn Producers of the Mato Grosso region said farmers first noticed in March that their genetically modified corn crops were less resistant to the destructive caterpillars that \"Bt corn\" — which has been genetically modified to produce a toxin that repels certain pests — is supposed to protect against. In turn, farmers have been forced to apply extra coats of insecticides, racking up additional environmental and financial costs.\n\nThe association, which goes by the name Aprosoja-MT, is calling on Monsanto, DuPont, Syngenta, and Dow companies to offer solutions as well as compensate the farmers for their losses. In a release posted to the Aprosoja-MT website, spokesman Ricardo Tomcyzk said farmers spent the equivalent of $54 per hectare to spray extra pesticides, and that the biotech companies promised something they didn't deliver, \"i.e. deceptive advertising.\" (via Google Translate)\n\nBut Monsanto, et al are unlikely to accommodate the farmers. According to Reuters, \"seed companies say they warned Brazilian farmers to plant part of their corn fields with conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to GMO seeds.\" \n\n\n\nEarlier this year, a similar problem arose in the U.S., when scientists confirmed that corn-destroying rootworms had evolved to be resistant to the GMO corn engineered to kill them.\n\nThe industry response to such loss of efficacy is not to encourage biodiversity, but to further modify the organisms, according to the non-profit GM Watch.\n\nThe case of Brazil is an example for an overall trend showing that nearly twenty years after the start of commercialization of Bt crops, there are problems in several countries growing this kind of genetically engineered crop. Industry tries to tackle this issue by commercialization of so called \"stacked events\" that produce several different Bt toxins. The best known example is Monsanto's SmartStax maize that produces six different Bt toxins.\n\nAnother unintended outcome is almost certainly an increased use of pesticides, as has already happened in Mato Grosso.",

            "text": "SAO PAULO, Brazil (Reuters) — Genetically modified corn seeds are no longer protecting Brazilian farmers from voracious tropical bugs, increasing costs as producers turn to pesticides, a farm group said.\n\nProducers want four major manufacturers of so-called BT corn seeds to reimburse them for the cost of spraying up to three coats of pesticides this year, said Ricardo Tomczyk, president of Aprosoja farm lobby in Brazil’s Mato Grosso state.\n\nLarge-scale farming in the bug-ridden tropics has always been a challenge, and now Brazil’s government is concerned that planting the same crops repeatedly with the same seed technologies has left the agricultural superpower vulnerable to pest outbreaks and dependent on toxic chemicals.\n\nExperts in the United States have also warned about corn production prospects because of a growing bug resistance to genetically modified corn. Researchers in Iowa found significant damage from rootworms in corn fields last year.\n\nIn Brazil, the main corn culprit is Spodoptera frugiperda, also known as the corn leafworm or southern grassworm.\n\nSeed companies say they warned Brazilian farmers to plant part of their corn fields with conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to GM seeds.\n\nDow Agrosciences, a division of Dow Chemical Company, has programs in Brazil to help corn farmers develop “an integrated pest management system that includes, among other things, the cultivation of refuge areas,” it said in an email.\n\nAnother company, DuPont, said it had not received any formal notification from Aprosoja. The company’s Pioneer brand has been working with producers to extend the durability of its seed technology and improve efficiency since Spodoptera worms were found to have developed resistance to the Cry1F protein, it said in a statement.\n\nThe other two companies, Mon-santo and Syngenta, did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nTomczyk said Aprosoja encouraged the planting of refuge areas. But he said the seed companies have not given clear instructions.\n\n“There are barely any non-GMO seeds available … it is very uncomfortable that the companies are blaming the farmers,” he said.\n\nAprosoja hopes to reach a negotiated agreement with the seed companies, but if all else fails farmers may sue to get reparations for pesticide costs, he added.\n\nBrazil is harvesting its second of two annual corn crops and expects to produce 78 million tonnes this crop year, slightly less than last season’s record.

they have constitutional rights just like flesh and blood people and even that the religious convictions of their owners trump the laws passed by congress guaranteeing women proper health care its so cool to know that my religious convictions exempt me from the laws of our country i guess this is whats meant by freedom i was pleased to see that the satanists have said that their religious beliefs include preventing women seeking abortions from having to endure public slut shaming by rightwing christians and pegging their stance to the hobby lobby decision hey if jesus freaks can get supreme court backing why not devil worshippers fair is fair so lets agree for the sake of argument that corporations are just like flesh and blood people entitled to equal protection of the law arent they then also required to abide by the law or do they get a free pass how about those financial criminals at goldman sachs—you know the guys who put together all those worthless subprime mortgagebacked securities and sold them at top prices to rubes who believed their assertions that the securities were as good as gold how come they dont get prosecuted if i sold you a deed to the brooklyn bridge the law would call me a con man and id be in the pokey plenty quick and how about monsanto theres a ton of evidence from all around the world that roundup herbicide when used in regions where the water contains lots of dissolved metals causes severe—and often fatal—kidney damage farm workers applying this stuff in places like el salvador argentina and india are dying in droves now if you or i were going around the world with a bag of chemicals so toxic that our employees who had to spread them were dying and that hundreds of farmers we forced to buy our genetically engineered seeds were committing suicide because they were going bankrupt as a consequence and that we made a product so toxic that it is poisoning millions of people around the world and causing malformations in developing babies andwell you get the idea what would happen to us do you think wed be invited to run the government agencies that oversee the health and safety of the american food supply i dont think so i think wed be charged with murder or if federal prosecutors believed us when we professed innocence—honestly we didnt know our product did that—wed at least be charged with wrongful death negligent homicide and manslaughter so how come companies like monsanto get all the rights but none of the responsibilities of actual human beings the answer i think—and dont laugh—is that huge corporations like monsanto are superhuman they are entitled to do what they want because they can buy their way out of trouble when was the last time you saw the head of a big corporation go to jail for running a company that murders people yes monsanto but also general motors whose lawyers fudged and hedged and covered up the fact that gm cars were killing people and many other big corporations too fit this profile oh from time to time the corporations get hit with monetary fines but paying out a few million or even a few billion is no biggie they call it a cost of doing business and write it off as a business expense meanwhile theres a trail of dead human beings left decaying in the dirt but thats what it means to be superhuman no actual human being goes to jail no ceo does hard time and you cant jail a corporation which despite the supreme court is nothing more than a legal fiction created on paper and signed by the miscreants who should be clapped in irons what—are you going to put a file folder in a prison cell im sorry but the roberts court is so far removed from reality that its breathtaking and socalled constitutional scholar barack obama and his top cop eric holder who should be yelling bloody murder roll over like friendly poodles begging for a belly rub big corporations are not superhuman—while they occasionally do good things to polish their image fundamentally they act subhuman without heart or mercy caring only for their bottom lines thats their nature thats their charter thats their function those who preside over our federal government should call out the corporations on their crimes should point out their subhumanity should stand as bulwarks against their depredations what if barack obama stood up at a podium and said something like the following while corporate america is a driving wheel of our economic system it must be subservient to the welfare of the american citizenry not its master we should support it when it adds to the public welfare and check its excesses when it doesnt and so im creating a new cabinet post one dedicated to making sure that no corporation financial institution or governmental regulatory body has so much power

            "text": "The Supreme Court has ruled that corporations are people, that they have Constitutional rights just like flesh and blood people, and even that the religious convictions of their owners trump the laws passed by Congress guaranteeing women proper health care. It’s so cool to know that my religious convictions exempt me from the laws of our country. I guess this is what’s meant by freedom.\n\nI was pleased to see that the Satanists have said that their religious beliefs include preventing women seeking abortions from having to endure public slut shaming by rightwing Christians, and pegging their stance to the Hobby Lobby decision. Hey, if Jesus freaks can get Supreme Court backing, why not devil worshippers? Fair is fair.\n\nSo let’s agree, for the sake of argument, that corporations are just like flesh and blood people, entitled to equal protection of the law. Aren’t they then also required to abide by the law? Or do they get a free pass? How about those financial criminals at Goldman Sachs—you know, the guys who put together all those worthless sub-prime mortgage-backed securities and sold them at top prices to rubes who believed their assertions that the securities were as good as gold? How come they don’t get prosecuted? If I sold you a deed to the Brooklyn Bridge, the law would call me a con man and I’d be in the pokey plenty quick.\n\nAnd how about Monsanto? There’s a ton of evidence from all around the world that Roundup herbicide, when used in regions where the water contains lots of dissolved metals, causes severe—and often fatal—kidney damage. Farm workers applying this stuff in places like El Salvador, Argentina, and India are dying in droves.\n\nNow if you or I were going around the world with a bag of chemicals so toxic that our employees who had to spread them were dying, and that hundreds of farmers we forced to buy our genetically engineered seeds were committing suicide because they were going bankrupt as a consequence, and that we made a product so toxic that it is poisoning millions of people around the world and causing malformations in developing babies, and…well, you get the idea. What would happen to us? Do you think we’d be invited to run the government agencies that oversee the health and safety of the American food supply?\n\nI don’t think so. I think we’d be charged with murder. Or, if federal prosecutors believed us when we professed innocence—“Honestly, we didn’t know our product did that”—we’d at least be charged with wrongful death, negligent homicide, and manslaughter.\n\nSo how come companies like Monsanto get all the rights, but none of the responsibilities, of actual human beings?\n\nThe answer, I think—and don’t laugh—is that huge corporations like Monsanto are superhuman. They are entitled to do what they want because they can buy their way out of trouble. When was the last time you saw the head of a big corporation go to jail for running a company that murders people? Yes, Monsanto, but also General Motors, whose lawyers fudged and hedged and covered up the fact that GM cars were killing people. And many other big corporations, too, fit this profile. Oh, from time to time, the corporations get hit with monetary fines, but paying out a few million or even a few billion, is no biggie. They call it a cost of doing business and write it off as a business expense. Meanwhile, there’s a trail of dead human beings left decaying in the dirt. But that’s what it means to be superhuman. No actual human being goes to jail. No CEO does hard time. And you can’t jail a corporation, which, despite the Supreme Court, is nothing more than a legal fiction created on paper and signed by the miscreants who should be clapped in irons. What—are you going to put a file folder in a prison cell?\n\nI’m sorry, but the Roberts Court is so far removed from reality that it’s breathtaking. And so-called Constitutional scholar Barack Obama and his top cop Eric Holder, who should be yelling bloody murder, roll over like friendly poodles begging for a belly rub.\n\nBig corporations are not superhuman—while they occasionally do good things to polish their image, fundamentally they act subhuman, without heart or mercy, caring only for their bottom lines. That’s their nature. That’s their charter. That’s their function. Those who preside over our Federal government should call out the corporations on their crimes. Should point out their subhumanity. Should stand as bulwarks against their depredations.\n\nWhat if Barack Obama stood up at a podium and said something like the following: “While corporate America is a driving wheel of our economic system, it must be subservient to the welfare of the American citizenry, not its master. We should support it when it adds to the public welfare, and check its excesses when it doesn’t. And so I’m creating a new cabinet post, one dedicated to making sure that no corporation, financial institution, or governmental regulatory body has so much power that it can ride roughshod over the Constitutional rights of the people.\n\n“Money is power, and so when corporations acquire enough money to work their will on Congress, they will be broken up. As in times past, banks will either be depositories of the citizenry’s wealth, or lenders in the rough and tumble of the free marketplace—but not both. Elections will be paid for by the U.S. Treasury, and no private money at all will be allowed to influence the electoral process. Candidates will stand or fall on their principles, or not at all.”\n\nI for one would say “Thank God.”\n\nHouse Republicans have passed an appropriations bill that blocks the EPA from limiting carbon pollution from power plants, slashes the EPA’s budget, and guts clean water protections.\n\nBrazilian farmers say their GMO corn is no longer resistant to pests, Reuters reports.\n\nThe Association of Soybean and Corn Producers of the Mato Grosso region said farmers first noticed in March that their genetically modified corn crops were less resistant to destructive caterpillars that “Bt corn” is supposed to protect against. As a result, farmers have been forced to apply extra insecticide, racking up additional environmental and financial costs.\n\nThe farmers’ association is calling on Monsanto, DuPont, Syngenta, and Dow to offer solutions as well as compensate the farmers for their losses. Association spokesman Ricardo Tomcyzk said farmers spent the equivalent of $54 per hectare to spray extra pesticides, and that the biotech companies promised something they didn’t deliver, which he called “deceptive advertising.”\n\nBut Monsanto, et al, are unlikely to accommodate the farmers. According to Reuters, “Seed companies say they warned Brazilian farmers to plant part of their corn fields with conventional seeds to prevent bugs from mutating and developing resistance to GMO seeds.” Earlier this year, a similar problem arose in the U.S., when scientists confirmed that corn-destroying rootworms had evolved to be resistant to the GMO corn engineered to kill them.\n\nThe industry response to such loss of efficacy is not to encourage biodiversity, but to further modify the organisms, the non-profit GM Watch reports. An unintended outcome is almost certainly an increased use of pesticides, as has already happened in Mato Grosso. Or maybe, knowing Monsanto and the other agricultural chemical giants, the outcome is not so unintended.\n\nAt the recent annual meeting of Safeway shareholders in Pleasanton, California, the overwhelming majority of shareholders followed the advice of the National Center for Public Policy Research (a corporatist right wing think tank) and rejected a shareholder proposal that would have forced the grocery store chain to brand products containing genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) with labels.\n\nLike Safeway shareholders, Monsanto shareholders overwhelmingly agreed with the National Center and soundly rejected a similar proposal.\n\nThe Guardian picked up the story and gave lots of space to the National Center’s propaganda about the evils of GMO labeling (labels will cause food prices to rise and hurt the poor) and how organizations with scientific cred all think that GMOs are not only safe, but will contribute to ending world hunger.\n\nI think that The Guardian missed the real story, which is that shareholders who understand that genetically modified foods should be labeled are infiltrating the meetings and floating motions that put Safeway and Monsanto on the defensive.",

            "text": "23 July 2014 Genetically engineered maize 1507 may soon be approved for cultivation in the European Union. This maize event was developed by US companies Pioneer/DuPont and Dow. Maize 1507 is a so-called Bt crop that produces an insecticidal protein. The plants are also tolerant to herbicides with the active ingredient glufosinate.\n\nAccording to a study published in the journal Crop Protection, it has now been shown for the first time that certain pests in Brazil are becoming resistant to this maize line only few years after market approval. Farias et al. (2014) found resistant populations of fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), in the federal states Bahia and Rio Grande del Sul. Fall armyworm is the most important maize pest in Brazil. The publication was supported by Dow.\n\nAccording to the authors, development of resistance in fall armyworm was first noticed in 2012, the third year after the start of cultivation of maize 1507 in Brazil.\n\nFrom a scientific point of view, resistance in Spodoptera frugiperda doesn't come as a surprise. Studies conducted in Puerto Rico had already shown in 2008 that this pest insect had acquired resistance after few years of cultivation. As a consequence of these findings, industry withdrew maize 1507 from the market in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe case of Brazil is an example for an overall trend showing that nearly twenty years after the start of commercialisation of Bt crops, there are problems in several countries growing this kind of genetically engineered crop (see figure „Bt crops: Resistance development in pest insects“, http://www.testbiotech.org/en/node/1077). Industry tries to tackle this issue by commercialisation of so called „stacked events“ that produce several different Bt toxins. The best known example is Monsanto's SmartStax maize that produces six different Bt toxins.\n\nThe European Food Safety Agency EFSA first issued a favourable opinion regarding cultivation of maize 1507 in 2005. Because the EU Commission failed to approve maize 1507, Pioneer brought the Commission before the European Court of Justice. The court ruled in 2013 that the Commission must come to a final decision on cultivation soon.\n\nTestbiotech is demanding a stop of the approval process for maize 1507, especially because there are fundamental data gaps in risk assessment.",

In December, the soybean farmers again sued the GMO company for about US $1 billion for illegally collecting royalties on the old RR1 seeds and forcing the Brazilians to sign “abusive” purchase contracts for the new ones, according to Sustainable Pulse.\n\nBrazil is harvesting its second of two annual corn crops and expects to produce 78 million tonnes this crop year, slightly less than last season’s record. Domestic prices recently fell to their lowest in four years because of abundant supplies, Reuters reported.",
