            "text": "The exploded British Petroleum oil well pumping daily an estimated 210,000 gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico is still hemorrhaging today as wildlife officials, politicians, and oil industry executives are clambering to triage and treat the crisis.Calling the calamity a “potentially unprecedented environmental disaster,” President Obama flew to Louisiana yesterday afternoon to see firsthand the emergency response efforts. He found rain, high winds, and seven- to ten-foot sea swells hindering aerial attempts to treat oil with chemical dispersants and hampering marine efforts to coral the colossal oil slick with miles-long strings of vinyl containment booms. With the slick swiftly drifting toward the coast and a chain of fragile barrier islands that were pummeled by recent hurricanes, including Katrina in 2005, wetland birds nesting and feeding in these seafood-rich waters are literally sitting ducks, oystercatchers, black skimmers, egrets, pelicans, and plovers. Even airborne migratory songbirds flying through the area at night in transit to northern breeding grounds could be affected by the spill if they encounter heavy smoke from fires that may be deployed to burn surface oil during the next few days. Environmental groups with personnel in the area, including the National Audubon Society (BirdLife Partner in the US) are being inundated with calls from concerned citizens wanting to help. Audubon Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi staff and chapters are working to prepare for impacts to birds, wildlife and important habitat by coordinating volunteer efforts as the spill makes its way toward land.From cleaning oiled birds, which requires proper training, to counting birds to picking up trash on beaches, there are many things that you can do to help. If you are interested in volunteering, sign up here . Wildlife experts are stressing that while every hand is needed and welcome, it is vital that volunteers offer their help through coordinated efforts so that the greatest good can be focused where it is needed the most. They are asking the public to avoid going to affected areas or handling wildlife until they are part of coordinated responses because even well-intentioned people can inadvertently interfere with important recovery efforts. Audubon is also calling for concerned citizens to help avoid future spills by submitting comments on the Interior Department's plan to expand offshore oil and gas drilling.

            "body": "unscreened amusings eh its been a little over two weeks since i last posted i have a few thoughts and then might do a little catching up before this is all done first the flooding in nashville is really sad its amazing that so much damage can be done with just rain and no hurricane or other tropical system when a strong hurricane comes on shore its expected that there will be a good deal of damage particularly flooding with storm surge and heavy rains its doubtful than anyone predicted the enormity of the flooding that inundated nashville while it may not be on par with the damage left behind from hurricane katrina nashville is still a large city reeling from the devastating effects of mother nature new orleans at least had a chance to mobilize and prepare for katrina i very seriously doubt the people of nashville could have been prepared for this past weekend speaking of katrina its interesting how the federal government personified in george bush received so much blame for the problems that plagued new orleans as a result of katrina particularly in dealing with people who didnt evacuate before the storm but also i find it equally interesting that very few and no one in the msm are hinting that the federal government is at fault for the severity of the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico in the new york times today the question was raised as to just how bad the spill will eventually be some are wringing their hands over the specter of one of the worst environmental disasters ever although at this point the spill is not near the size and scope of the worst spills ever president obama has said the spill is a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster no matter how you slice it it aint good the federal government has also been quick to point the finger at british petroleum bp as the point of blame and also to stress that bp will finance the cleanup and compensatory claims however what the federal government including the white house is not saying is that the federal government has actually had a plan in place to contain such spills a plan that dates back to 1994 unfortunately the federal government did not have any of the necessary tools in place along the gulf to put the plan into effect by the time the uscg acted on the plan the spill had been growing for eight days in a flash of incompetency reminiscent of femas michael brown during the aftermath of hurricane katrina uscg mary landry said the government had all the assets it needed right except the one that the plan for containing an oil spill in the gulf actually called for bottom line the geographical devastation of katrina probably could not have been averted however the human suffering could have possible been amelioratedbut not by the federal government the immediate blame for the human element of devastation in new orleans lies primarily in three places first the people who could have evacuated but refused second for those who were unable to evacuate on their own the city of new orleans made no provision whatsoever to evacuate its residents third governor kathleen blanco waited until the last minute to activate the national guard making it almost impossible for them to mobilize to adequately assist those who remained behind for whatever reason had these three been done correctly in the first place the pressure on the federal government would have been lessened and likely done more efficiently although thats doubtful after all it is the government were talking about while bp should certainly be held accountable for their shortcomings the federal government under the leadership of president obama as commander in chief and the uscg whose responsibility it should have been to contain the spill by putting into effect the plan to do so developed over 15 years ago should also be held responsible for allowing the spill to grow to its current size of course with offshore drilling such an issue these days we cant expect the federal government to let a good crisis go to waste huh in the midst of the environmental disaster looming because of the ineptitude of the federal government we should remember the families of those 11 workers who died as a result of the explosion of the deepwater horizon the loss of their lives has been turned into a political football much like the deaths of the 29 miners in west virginia in other news the fbi captured the suspected mastermind behind an attempt to explode a car bomb in crowded times square on saturday night by the way for those keeping score at home the suspect 30 year old faisal shahzad is a naturalized american citizen from pakistan odd that considering new yorks mayor michael bloombergs early description of the perpetrator invoked images of timothy mcveigh or a militia group or maybe a tea party group saying the suspect was probably homegrownsomebody with a political agenda that doesnt like the healthcare bill seriously threats came from all over the place after comedy central aired an episode of south park depicting mohammed and the immigration bill in arizona has created quite a stir really the healthcare bill finally how about some local flair a principal at a local k8 school in a not so great neighborhood to say the least was given leave without pay for shaving off half of a kids eyebrow apparently shaving slits in ones eyebrow is some kind of gang sign so shed told the kids not to do it anymore one did so she got a razor and shaved half of it off so it wouldnt show the slit like one person i heard comment on the situation said if she had slept with the kid shed still be getting paid while on leave",

committee on energy and natural resources washington dc the committee met pursuant to notice at 1008 am in room sr325 russell senate office building hon jeff bingaman chairman presiding opening statement of hon jeff bingaman us senator from new mexico the chairman the hearing will come to order today is the third hearing of this committee on issues related to the deepwater horizon disaster in the gulf of mexico while todays hearing will focus on liability and financial issues we continue to have foremost in our minds the human component of this accident the 11 rig workers who lost their lives their families the people of the gulf who are experiencing this catastrophic situation firsthand yesterday i was fortunate to accompany our assistant majority leader dick durbin and senator murkowski senator landrieu senator whitehouse senator vitterall of us spent the day in the gulf observing the consequences of this accident and the joint response of our government agencies npb and the many volunteers its a sobering reality to see oil begin to impact the shorelines and know that this well is not yet under control however i also saw many people who have been working night and day for weeks to fight this spill and to protect the gulf and i think we all express our gratitude to them for their extraordinary effort today we examine the liability financial responsibility and penalty provisions of the law related to this accident this isthere is urgency in our effort we need to ensure that those harmed by this accident are fully compensated and that a system is in place that properly allocates risks and losses based on what ive learned so far i believe that we have a system in dire need of repair current law caps the responsible partys damages other than the cleanup cost at 75 million which clearly is nowhere near the damages that resulthave resulted from this disaster equally as troubling the law requires the secretary of interior to adjust the amount of these caps at least every 3 years to reflect significant increases in the consumer price index yet the limit on damages for offshore facilities has not been increased since the law was passed in 1990 twenty years of inflation have been ignored victims of the disaster will certainly wonder why there should be any cap on damages and why those responsible should not simply be required to pay the full amount of the harm they caused bp has stated that it will pay all legitimate claims and that it will not insist on the 75million cap currently in the law but even accepting this as true we have a broken system that is in need of repair the oil spill liability trust fund financed almostfinanced mostly by taxes on oil is intended to cover higher levels of damages and to spread the risk of excess damages among the industry as a whole yet it is limited to paying 1 billion per incident congress over the years has been inconsistent in acting taxes to fund this effort and the taxes that support it are scheduled to expire in 2017 so we obviously need to look at that as well the law also requires that operators in the offshore environment demonstrate certain levels of financial responsibility to ensure that they can cover the losses that they may cause however for facilities like the deepwater horizon the maximum amount required is 150 million and the standard requirement is only 35 million this amount has not been increased in decades we obviously need to fix this finally there are civil and criminal penalties available to the secretary to punish those who violate safety and other requirements these are intended to be a deterrent to playing fast and loose with the rules and creating safety risks but the civil penalties were set in 1990 at 20000 a day theyve been raised only once to 35000 a day here too the law requires the secretary to adjust these penalties every 3 years to reflect increases in the consumer price index and that has only occurred sporadically so we have our work cut out for us these are complex areas of law and policy we have a number of experts here to help us think through how to fix these problems and i look forward to their testimony i know senator whitehouse is here to speak briefly about his legislation that hes introduced regarding civil and criminal penalties but before calling on him let me call on senator murkowski for her statement statement of hon lisa murkowski us senator from alaska senator murkowski thank you mr chairman i want to thank you for agreeing to hold this very important hearing this morning as you have mentioned in your statement our visit yesterday to the gulf that senator whitehouse and senator landrieu and several others joined us on i think was a very important visit a very important trip to understand the impact of the deepwater horizon spill understand better the consequences as that spill unfolds as we see the impact to local residents certainly to the marine environment i can assure you that what i saw yesterday certainly has reinforced my commitment to help make things right for all those whose lives and their livelihoods are being so vastly affected by this disaster when it comes to the issue of liability associated with a major oil spill i dont think that theres any state thats represented here on this committee that has a more direct experience certainly a more immediate concern than the state of alaska when the exxon valdez tragedy occurred it was a horrible incident at that time it was a long and very sad part of alaskas history the litigation that followed was years in being resolved the litigation over punitive damages literally took 2 decades to resolve that andin and of itself was an absolute tragedy and i am committed to ensuring that we dont see a similar situation unfold with this gulf spill now i wanted our committee to hold this hearing because theres been considerable discussion about the liability for the deepwater horizon spill and what part of that liability is limited or not limited i think there has been some mischaracterization out there that bp is only going to be responsible for 75 million of the spill mr chairman if i really thought that the federal government was going to protect companies that have billions of dollars in assets and then require that they only pay 75 million regardless of the ultimate costs and damages for the spill with taxpayers and spill victims that could possibly then be hung out to dry i would be the absolute first to introduce legislation to correct what would clearly be a flawed system the reality is is that this 75 million figure is drawn from just one provision on strict liability in opa the oil pollution act and it has nothing to do with the expressly unlimitedthe unlimited liability provided for the cleanup costs i think its also important to recognize that it has nothing to do with the laws authorization for unlimited damages that are allowed under various state laws we recognize that not every state has unlimited strict liability so we do need to take that into account i think we have all stated around this table here in this committee room with the ceo of bp in front of us that we must hold and we will hold bp accountable mr chairman you have stated and repeated again the affirmation that was made by bp that they willthey will pay for and provide for all of those costs that are incurred as a result of this oil spill when we were in the gulf yesterday with secretary napolitano and secretary salazar they too reiterated many many times throughout the course of the day that bp will be responsible for the damagesfor the costs associated with the spill i think that we need to listen carefully and constructively on how we hold companies liable how we incentivize stronger safety and environmental safeguards as it pertains to the 75 million liability cap my own opinion is that we need to increase this liability cap to reflect both the inflation the changing financial and the risk portfolios that are associated with certain types of exploration i hope that as we consider some of the suggestions here today and going out into the future here we consider how we make changes in ways that are not arbitrary right now theres a proposal out there that the liability cap needs to be 10 billion is that the right figure i dont know maybe it is maybe it needs to be higher maybe it needs to be unlimited maybe it needs to be somewhere in between but i think we need to make the time take the time to ensure that youre building good policy on this if congress decides to impose a strict and direct liability of an additional 10 billion on top of the unlimited cleanup and the unlimited lawsuits that can be brought aboutagainst responsible parties in state courts i think we have to consider what the potential consequences might be will there be jobs lost particularly in the gulf coast our energys nationsour energy security perhaps weakened we need to be considering these aspects weve got an interest in making sure that the victims of this tragic spill and god forbid that any future spills are justly compensated in a fair and an expeditious manner i think it is important that we figure out how we deal with this liability cap in increasing it but again im reserving judgment on what that appropriate figure might be until weve examined this in a way that secretary salazar asked us to do just last week so i welcome the witnesses that we will have today i welcome senator whitehouse for his perspective i thank you mr chairman for your leadership on this issue the chairman thank you very much senator whitehouse has introduced legislation s 3346 to revise the civil and criminal penalty provisions we welcome him to the committee to make a statement about that bill go right ahead statement of hon sheldon whitehouse us senator from rhode island senator whitehouse thank you chairman bingaman thank you ranking member murkowski and members of the energy and natural resources committee first of all thank you for holding this hearing i encourage you to review the penalty and liability framework governing offshore drilling and enact changes to this framework so we can prevent future disasters like the one now unfolding in the gulf thank you also for inviting me to make a few remarks about my outer continental shelf lands acts amendments of 2010 bill s 3346 the bill seeks to enhance penalties for failing to meet worker safety and environmental regulations on offshore oil rigs it is just one piece of the puzzle my colleague senator menendez has introduced 2 other bills to raise liability caps for oil spills when they occur and to eliminate the perincident cap on claims to the oil spill liability trust fund im a cosponsor of both of these bills and commend senator menendezs leadership on this issue i look forward to working with him and all of my colleagues in the senate to forge a strong deterrence system to discourage irresponsible oil drilling just yesterday as the chairman has indicated we visited louisianathe chairman the ranking member senator landrieu senator durbin and othersto inspect the disaster caused by the bp deepwater horizon oil spill since the tragic explosion on this oil rig on the night of april 20 which took the lives of 11 workers oil from mississippi canyon block 252 has been spewing uncontrollably into the deep waters of the gulf at a rate that no one seems able to accurately calculate and that has very likely been underestimated i knew the extent of the spill from press reports but it is another thing entirely to go and see the massive oil slick spread across the surface of the gulf with black smoke billowing off of the waters where controlled burns are taking place oil is now also washing up on coastal beaches and wetlands areas vital to the economies of louisiana mississippi alabama and florida while in the gulf we also heard from shrimpers and other gulf fishermen about the destruction of the ecosystem and the potential collapse of their industries some of these folks are secondand thirdgeneration fishermen this is literally the only life they have ever known and they worry it could be gone forever rhode island fishermen face similar worries at home more based on economic concerns than on oil spills but im sympathetic to the concerns of our fishing community and this fishing community s 3346 would amend the outer continental shelf lands act by enhancing penalties in the following 3 ways increasing civil penalties from 38000 per violation to 70000 per violation per day two where the violation constitutes a threat of serious irreparable or immediate harm or damage to life including fish and other aquatic life property any mineral deposit or the marine coastal or human environment increase civil penalties from 38000 per violation per day to 150000 per violation per day three increase the upper bound of criminal penalties from 100000 per violation per day to 10 million per violation per day the goal of the outer continental shelf penalties program is to assure safe and environmentally sound oil and gas operations on the outer continental shelf enhancing these penalties will go a long way to deter oil companies from cutting corners on safety measures that can prevent disasters like the gulf spill we need to take a comprehensive look at the penalty and liability framework that governs offshore oil and gas drilling and the substantive requirements that exist to protect our workers our coastlines and the marine environment from devastating oil spills we may want to consider banning drilling at certain depths until its clear that we can engage in repair and recovery activities at those depths chairman bingaman i applaud your efforts to address the liability portion of this work in todays hearing one thing im certain of is that the current penalty and liability system is inadequate in just the first 3 months of this year the five largest oil companies worldwide including bp made 23 billion in profits the current liability and penalty limits are inconsequential in the face of those recordbreaking profits i want to close by anticipating an argument we will hear from the oil and gas industry that enhancing penalties will drive companies out of the business of offshore drilling the way i see it robust safety and environmental standards and tough penalties for noncompliance with those standards help to avoid disasters like the bp deepwater horizon oil spill not only will it save workers lives and protect our marine and coastal environments but this will save money because these disasters cost many times more than the cost of prevention just consider these costs in the 1996 north cape scandia spill off the coast of rhode island cleanup costs natural resource damages and penalties totaled almost 32 million in the 1989 world prodigy spill at brenton reef rhode island cleanup costs and fines exceeded 35 million rough estimates of the cleanup costs for deepwater horizons bill range from 2 billion to 8 billion suddenly 75000 or 150000 doesnt seem like such a very large number mr chairman id like to offer into the record of these proceedings a list of some of bps violations of outer continental shelf lands act regulations taken from the mms web site these are exactly the types of safety systems that failed on april 20 may i ask consent to have that submitted for the record the chairman were glad to have that included senator whitehouse i appreciate the attention of the committee i thank you and your good work the chairman thank you for testifying and your leadership in introducing the bill that youve put forward we have 2 panels we will excuse you at this point we have 2 panels today of experts first from the administration and then from the congressional research service the first panel is thomas perrelli who is the associate attorney general second david hayes who is the deputy secretary of interior and third is craig bennett who is director of the coast guards national pollution funds center if they would all come forward please and take their seats if there is no particular preference on your part why dont we start with mr perrelli if you could give us your views in the first 5 or 6 minutes and then we will include all of the statements in full in the record and then well have questions mr perrelli go right ahead statement of thomas j perrelli associate attorney general department of justice mr perrelli thank you chairman bingaman and ranking member murkowski for the opportunity to testify about issues of liability and financial responsibility related to offshore oil production before i begin i would like to echo the chairmans sentiments and take a moment to express my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and to those who were injured in the explosion and sinking of the deepwater horizon the explosion and fire that took place aboard the deepwater horizon and the spill of oil that followed have created a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster for the people and fragile ecosystems of the gulf coast this disaster has been met with a massive and coordinated response from the federal government led by president obama the agencies operating as a part of the unified command and numerous dedicated federal officials have been on the scene from the beginning the activities have been focused as they must be on stopping the oil spill and preventing and mitigating its effects the department of justice too has been fully engaged in these response efforts our mandate is to make sure that we recover every dime of taxpayer funds that the united states spends for the removal efforts and damages caused by this catastrophe we have been working tirelessly and will continue to do so to carry out this mandate and ensure that the american people do not pay for any of the damages for which others are responsible at the direction of the attorney general we have been monitoring the situation on the ground coordinating our efforts with the state attorneys general and working with federal partner agencies and natural resources trustees to make sure that we measure and track every bit of cost incurred in damages to the united states the states and the environment we are looking ahead to issues of financial responsibility and liability many of which arise under the oil pollution act which is the subject of my testimony today as you know opa was passed in the wake of the exxon valdez disaster to provide specific legal authority for dealing with the consequences of oil spills opa gives federal officials the authority to designate responsible parties who first and foremost are required to clean up oil spills and then pay removal costs and damages the coast guard has thus far designated bp and transocean as responsible parties for this bill under opa in its current form opa contains conditional caps that in some instances limit the liability of responsible parties caps which are based on the size and nature of the vessel or facility that is the source of the spill bp has already stated in several fora however that it will not seek to limit its payments to the applicable cap and that it will not look to the federal government to reimburse it for claims that it pays in excess of the applicable cap we expect bp to uphold this commitment the us government is committed to making sure that all responsible parties in any oil spill are held fully accountable for the costs and the damages they have imposed on our people our communities and our natural resources the liability provisions of opa have not been updated in some time and it is clear that they need to be revised to better reflect the principle that polluters should bear the risks costs and damages associated with the harm they caused to individuals communities and the natural environment bp has recognized its obligation to fully compensate all those suffering damages in the current oil spill for the future we need to change the legal framework to ensure that there is no arbitrary cap on corporate responsibility for a similar major oil spill well work with congress to develop appropriate proposals and transitions thank you mr chairman the prepared statement of perrelli follows statement of thomas j perrelli associate attorney general department of justice chairman bingaman ranking member murkowski and members of the committee thank you for the opportunity to testify today about liability and financial responsibility issues related to offshore oil production before i begin i would like to take a moment to express my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives and to those who were injured in the explosion and sinking of the deepwater horizon introduction the explosion and fire that took place aboard the deepwater horizon mobile offshore drilling unit on april 20th and the spill of oil into the gulf of mexico that followed have created a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster for the people and fragile ecosystems of the gulf coast president obama the department of justice and the entire administration are committed to ensuring that those responsible for this tragic series of events are held fully accountable from the moment these events began to unfold this matter has had the close attention of attorney general holder while administration efforts have focused on responding to the disaster and ensuring that the responsible parties stop the discharge remove the oil and pay for all costs and damages the department of justice has been carefully monitoring events on the 2 ground and providing legal support to the agencies involved in the response efforts to handle the multiple legal issues that a disaster of this magnitude raises the attorney general has assembled a team of attorneys from our civil and environment and natural resource divisions who have experience with the legal issues that arise out of oil spills and other environmental disasters as well as the united states attorneys for the districts that are being or are likely to be affected by the spill the united states attorneys are on the frontline and have critically important knowledge of their communities and local matters we at the department of justice are working to coordinate our efforts not only with the other federal agencies involved but also with the state attorneys general for the affected states and with representatives from local communities my testimony today will focus on the oil pollution act of 1990 or opa as you know opa was passed in the wake of the exxon valdez disaster to provide specific legal authority for dealing with the consequences of oil spills opa assigns responsibility and liability for cleaning up such spills it also provides a liability scheme for payment of damages ranging from the immediate and ongoing economic harm that individuals and communities suffer to the potentially devastating and longterm harm done to precious natural resources although opa is the primary federal vehicle for addressing liability for response costs and damages resulting from oil spills it is not the only legal vehicle for seeking compensation for incidents such as those now unfolding in the gulf it is important to remember that opa expressly preserves state and other federal mechanisms for pursuing damages for injuries caused by such incidents and for assessing penalties for the underlying conduct that may cause such disasters there may be additional legal authorities available under both state and federal law but the focus of my testimony today is opa i assure you that this administration will explore all legal avenues to make sure that those responsible for this disaster pay for all of the devastation that they have caused our mandate is to make sure that we recover every dime that the united states government spends for the removal of the oil and the damages caused by this catastrophe we will work tirelessly to carry out that mandate and to ensure that the american people do not pay for any of the costs and damages for which others are responsible the oil pollution act of 1990 opa provides a strictliability scheme for payment of removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil from a vessel or facility into or upon the waters of the united states including the area in which the deepwater horizon explosion fire and oil spill occurred that means that those companies that are responsible parties under opa are responsible for paying costs and damages under the statute regardless of whether they are found to be at fault here under opa the coast guard has designated the source of the spill and has thus far identified bp and transocean as responsible parties under the statute opa establishes certain limits on liability according to a formula that varies based on the size and nature of the vessel or facility that is the source of the spill for discharges of oil from an offshore facility other than a deepwater port a responsible party is liable for all removal costs there is no cap on such a responsible partys liability for removal costs opa defines removal costs as the costs of removing spilled oil from water and shorelines or taking other actions as may be necessary to minimize or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare including wildlife and public and private property the responsible party must pay in full for the removal costs incurred by the united states a state or an indian tribe or by a private party acting in accordance with the national contingency plan in addition to being responsible for all removal costs a party responsible for a discharge of oil from an offshore facility is also liable for damages from the spill with recognized exceptions a responsible partys liability for damages for a discharge of oil from an offshore facility is limited to 75000000 per incident the liability cap does not apply if the discharge was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the responsible party or of any of its agents employees or contractors similarly no liability cap applies if the spill resulted from the responsible partysor its agents employees or contractorsviolation of an applicable federal safety construction or operating regulation under such circumstances a responsible party would be strictly liable for all damages covered by the statute recoverable damages cover among other things injuries to natural resources loss of subsistence use of such resources destruction of property loss of tax revenue loss of profits or earning capacity and net increased costs for additional public services including protection from fire safety or health hazards i note that bp has stated in congressional testimonyincluding lamar mckays testimony before this committee on may 11that it will not use the 75 million cap to limit its payment of legitimate claims under opa we expect bp to uphold this commitment rest assured however that the united states government is committed to making sure that all responsible parties are held fully accountable for all the costs and damages they have imposed on our people our communities and our precious resources in addition under opa the oil spill liability trust fund is available to pay compensation for removal costs and damages to the extent that a responsible party does not do so the fund is financed primarily by an 8 cent per barrel tax on oil collected from the oil industry for any one oilpollution incident the fund may pay up to 1 billion or the balance of the fund whichever is less natural resource damage assessments and claims in connection with a single incident are limited to 500 million of that 1 billion if the fund pays compensation to a claimant it becomes subrogated to all that claimants rights to recover from the responsible party under opa or from any party under any other law that is the fund steps into the shoes of claimants that the fund pays and assumes any rights of action that the claimants would otherwise have proposed amendments to oil pollution act as you know the president recently sent up a legislative proposal designed to improve our ability to respond to oil spills the proposal requested additional funding for many of the agencies that are responding to the present unprecedented oil spill of more direct relevance to this hearing the proposal would do two things first it would raise the potential cap on damages for responsible parties beyond the current limits second it would increase the amount in the oil spill liability trust fund by increasing the tax on industry through which the fund is financed and would increase the amount the fund could pay for cleanup and damages related to any given incident the administration supports a significant increase in liability for offshore oil and gas developers whose actions pollute our oceans and coastlines and threaten our wildlife and other natural resources there are a number of factors to consider in increasing the liability caps we must determine how to ensure that the liability rules provide the appropriate incentive for companies working in this field to fully account for the damages their actions may cause and to mitigate the risks of a catastrophic event we must consider how best to ensure that the liability rules we adopt provide confidence that an individual or business harmed by an oil spill will be able to seekand receivefair compensation and that the trustees charged with protecting our precious natural resources can secure adequate compensation for any harm done to those resources in addition we must consider the ways in which new liability rules may affect the structure of the offshore oil industry and the number of market participants we must analyze how any change in the caps will interact with the current liability structure under opa under that structure the party responsible for a spill is liable for associated costs and damages up to a specified cap if the cap applies with liability for additional costs and damages spread across the oil industry as a whole through the oil spill liability trust fund the administrations proposal to increase the applicable liability caps would apply to any party found to be liable under opa for any incident that occurred prior to enactment of the new liability caps the administration believes it is both fair and constitutional to enact legislation that would ensure that those who have caused environmental damage are held responsible for the damages they caused rather than imposing these costs on society more generally our experiences over the last twenty years and with the current disastrous chain of events have convinced us that the old liability caps are simply inadequate to deal with the potentially catastrophic consequences of oil spills we look forward to working with you to fix these caps conclusion the focus of everyones efforts right now isand should beon ensuring that bp stops the discharge of oil and responds to the immediate aftermath of the spill the review of the facts regarding the deepwater horizon explosion fire and oil spill is still in its infancy it would be premature to speculate as to the level of damages here or how much any responsible party will be liable to pay the department strongly supports the administrations legislative proposal and we look forward to working with you to see it adopted the chairman mr hayes were glad to have you before the committee go right ahead statement of david j hayes deputy secretary department of the interior mr hayes thank you mr chairman and members of the committee ill make a few oral remarks my written testimony is for the record thank you ive been asked to focus my testimony on the enforcement authority under the outer continental shelf lands act the companion to what mr perrelli is talking about in terms of the oil pollution act im delighted to testify on this subject obviously our first focus right now is on the oil spill disaster and the response to it secretary salazar sent me down to the gulf the firstthe morning after i know several of you visited with secretary salazar and napolitano yesterday and he reported this morning that it was an excellent trip and was delighted you were able to go now while our primary focus is on the disaster and responding to it its appropriate we believe that you are obviously taking up these broad policy questions we are also looking at important policy questions regarding this disaster and how to respond to it its for those reasons that secretary salazar commissioned an independent rootcause analysis to be done by the national academy of engineering that will be folded into the new presidential commission that will examine all aspects of this disaster and come up with new proposals potentially on how to ensure it will not occur again also secretary salazar will be delivering to the president later this week an interimmeasures report to deal with safety issues associated with ongoing activities on the outer continental shelf most notably and important to this committee is the fact that the secretary has reorganized the minerals management service already to take apart the enforcement side away from the leasing and permitting side he also in his reorganization removed the revenueproducing side from those 2 organizations so we look forward to working with you on those issues with regard to inspections and enforcement this has been anof very significant interest of the secretaries in fact last fall the secretary commissioned a unit of the national academy of sciences to take a stemtostern look if you will at the inspection program of mms that national academy study is ongoing and were looking forward to the results on the precise issue raised by senator whitehouses proposed testimony we agree that its appropriate to revisit whether the statutory penalties under the outer continental shelf lands act are adequate or not we note of course the additional liability scheme that mr perrelli focused on under the oil pollution act but certainly the outer continental shelf lands act is the primary enforcement mechanism for ongoing review and approvaland if necessary compliancefor the oil and gas industry in terms of offshore activities that the department of the interior has purview over in that regard i note that the original penalty authority came from the 1978 lands act amendments and the original fine was 10000 per day per violation in the 1990 oil pollution act there was an amendment to the outer continental shelf lands act that increased that fine for civil penalties to 20000 per day per violation plus it established the ability to adjust that upward under the consumer price index in 1997 mms revised the penalty amount up under the cpi to 25000 a day in 2003 it was again revised up because of the cpi to 30000 a day in 2007 it was again revised up to 35000 per day in august of last year mms did itthe latest cpi analysis and the cpi had not gone over the threshold to raise it further so there has been attention on this issue but we are based on a statutory structure thats been in place for some time as the administration we are absolutely open to considering amendments to the act to increase the current 35 per day per violation civil penalty and the 100000 criminal penalty we look forward to working with the committee on those issues thank you the prepared statement of mr hayes follows statement of david j hayes deputy secretary department of the interior thank you chairman bingaman ranking member murkowski and members of the committee for the opportunity to discuss liability enforcement and financial responsibility issues related to oil production on the outer continental shelf including those associated with the ongoing response to the deepwater horizon rig explosion before we begin let me express my sympathy to the families of those who lost their lives and the many who were injured or have lost their livelihood in this massive environmental disaster this spill continues to command our time and resources at the department of the interior as we work to ensure that the spill is stopped that those responsible are held accountable and that the natural resources along the gulf coast are protected and restored introduction secretary salazar said when he appeared before you last week that we at the department have been actively and aggressively engaged in this spill from day one the secretary has been to the gulf coast and houston many times to ensure all that can be done to stop the spill is being done to monitor the effects of the spill on our lands and waters in the gulf and to direct the departments response to this tragedy i left for the gulf the morning after the explosion to help provide senior ontheground leadership and communication with principals in washington working with rear admiral landry we stood up a joint command structure in those early days and moved from a search and rescue effort to a spill response effort i have continued to be involved in the response to this disaster each and every day from april 20 forward i have returned to the gulf twice since that initial trip and i am working virtually around the clock on gulfrelated response activities coordinating our departments efforts in responding to the spill both in terms of capping the well and in working to protect our trust resources from damage from the spill the secretary has detailed the many actions that we have taken in response to the explosion and spill and the major changes that we have been making at the minerals management servicenot just over the past 5 weeks but over the past 16 monthsto address prior ethics issues strengthen its independence balance its mission increase safety and improve management regulation and oversight of operations on the outer continental shelf ocs this kind of fundamental change does not always come easily or instantaneously but we have been committed to a reform agenda in the department since our arrival a little more than a year ago and we are determined to see it through the latest manifestation of these reforms the reorganization of mms was announced by the secretary last week the secretarial order released last week creates three separate entities within the department to address the three distinct and conflicting missions of the mmssafety and enforcement energy development and revenue collection we will be consulting with congress as we work out the details of this reorganization the result will be a strong and independent framework that will hold energy companies accountable and in compliance with the law of the land those responsible will be accountable we are here today to address issues of liability and enforcement as it pertains to oil and gas development on the ocs let me begin by noting that the president has been very clear in this regard we will not rest until this spill is contained and we will aggressively pursue compensation for all costs and damages from bp and other responsible parties there should be no doubt that all responsible parties will be held accountable for paying costs associated with this spill including all costs of the government in responding to the spill and compensation for loss and damages that arise from the spill at the urging of secretary salazar and secretary napolitano in a recent letter bp has confirmed that it will pay for all of these costs and damages regardless of whether the statutory liability cap contained in the oil pollution act applies the bottom line is that while the investigations as to the cause are still underway those found responsible will be held fully accountable for their actions outer continental shelf enforcement specific to development on the ocs the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla provides the department with the authority to manage access to and development of energy and mineral resources on the ocs and to ensure that operations on the ocs are safe and protective of the environment under its provisions the department has the authority to among other things promulgate and enforce safety and environmental regulations investigate and report on major fires oil spills death or serious injury review allegations of any violation of safety regulations under the act and summon witnesses and require the production of information in order to determine whether an operators performance on the ocs is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations the ocsla provides for scheduled onsite inspections at least once a year of each facility on the ocs and also periodic unannounced onsite inspections where no advance notice is given if those inspections find noncompliance with applicable requirements a wide range of enforcement actions can be taken depending on the circumstances ranging from written warnings to financial penalties to drilling andor production shutins of platforms wells equipment or pipelines as a matter of policy minerals management service inspectors and field engineers conduct complete inspections of all safety devices and environmental standards for drilling activities approximately once a month while drilling rigs are on location mms also conducts inspections of up to 3600 ocs production facilities every year finally mms conducts unannounced inspections generally targeting operators for whom compliance concerns exist or who are conducting inherently dangerous operations such as welding construction activities and normal production activities at the same time if an operator is found in violation of a safety or environmental requirement mms issues a citation requiring that the violation be fixed within 14 days on average about 24000 inspections per year are conducted and 2500 incidents of noncompliance incs are issued many of these incs are for minor noncompliance issues such as marking equipment improperly but some are for serious noncompliance issues such as 5 unauthorized bypassing of safety devices the latter triggers an automatic civil penalty referral discussed in detail below and may result in a component or facility shutin issuance of a facility shutin order is a serious and expensive penalty for noncompliance as it stops all production until the issue is fixed in 2009 mms issued 97 incs that resulted in shuttingin a production facility and 20 that resulted in shuttingin a drilling facility evidence of serious noncompliance may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties for failure to comply with requirements under the law a license a permit or any regulation or order issued under the act these provisions are found in section 24 of the act 43 usc sec 1350 and are currently set at not more than 35000 per day for civil administrative penalties or 100000 per day for criminal penalties violations that cause injury death environmental damage or pose a threat to human life or the environment will trigger a civil penalty review civil penalties are reviewed and assessed by the mms under three categories that reflect the severity and number of operator violations from fiscal year 2000 through fy 2008 over 18 million in civil penalties were collected in the spirit of working to improve and reform the mms inspection program and as part of our mms reform agenda in september 2009 the secretary asked the national marine board an arm of the highly respected national academy of sciences to direct an independent review of mmss inspection program for offshore facilities the results of that review are due to us this fall and will help us enhance the effectiveness of that program as we implement our reforms we are also addressing the program through changes to the budget the mms inspection program which currently has 55 inspectors in the gulf of mexico region and 7 in the pacific and alaska regions would receive under the presidents fiscal year 2011 budget funding for an additional 6 inspectors for offshore oil and gas facilities in the gulf an increase of more than 10 percent in addition the administrations recently submitted legislative proposal to address the bp oil spill also contains among other things a request for an additional 29 million for the department to further increase its inspection capability as well as to support the development of new enforcement and safety regulations and to carry out studies needed in light of this event the outer continental shelf lands act amendments act the outer continental shelf lands act amendments act s 3346 proposes to increase the amount of the civil penalties available under the ocsla to 75000 per day provide for a mandatory civil penalty of not more than 150000 per day without regard to the allowance of a time period for corrective action for continuing violations that constitute a threat of serious irreparable or immediate harm or damage to life including fish and aquatic life property mineral deposits or the environment and increase criminal penalties for violations to 10 million the maximum daily civil penalty was adjusted to 35000 by regulation in march 2007 while the department published a notice summarizing review of the amount of this maximum civil penalty in the federal register in january 2010 we recognize that the underlying statutory requirements have not been amended in 20 years when the amount for civil penalties was changed as part of the oil pollution control act of 1990 moreover the statutory amount for criminal penalties has not been amended since its enactment in 1978 when the existing criminal penalty provisions of not more than 100000 per day or imprisonment for not more than 10 years were put in place the investigations into the deepwater horizon explosion and this spill have not been completed so it is premature to speculate as to the extent to which the proposed increased penalty provisions would apply to this particular matter nevertheless given the time that has elapsed since these provisions were last amended we believe it is appropriate to consider thoughtful increases in the amount of both civil and criminal penalties under the act we welcome the opportunity to work with congress on this matter as this legislation moves forward conclusion the department is committed to ensuring that we are doing all we can to assist those in the gulf coast region to persevere through this disaster and that our important places are protected and restored we are working to ensure that bp and other responsible parties are doing all they can to stop the discharge of oil and meet their responsibilitiesand commitmentsto the region the reforms we are putting in place will ensure the integrity of the ocs program into the future and the joint investigation we are carrying out with the department of homeland security and the 30 day safety review ordered by the president will provide us with valuable information and will help us identify what caused this tragedy and what safety measures should be immediately implemented we will get to the bottom of this disaster and will hold those responsible fully accountable the chairman thank you very much mr bennett go right ahead statement of craig bennett director national pollution fund center united states coast guard mr bennett good morning chairman bingaman ranking member murkowski and members of the committee i am grateful for the opportunity to testify today about the oil pollution act of 1990 liability and compensation regime as it relates to the oil spill in the gulf i have been the director of the national pollution fund center for 2 years and i was chief of the financial management division at the npfc for 4 years prior to assuming my current position my role as the director of the npfc in this response is threefold first i fund the federal response using amounts congress has made available from the oil spill liability trust fund the socalled emergency fund second i ensure the responsible party is advertising its availability to pay claims for removal costs and damages if claimants are not fully compensated by a responsible party they may present their claims to the npfc for payment from the fund third i recover federal response costs and claims paid by the fund from any and all responsible parties with respect to the deepwater horizon response bp reported yesterday that they have spent over 760 million in their response to this spill federal response costs against the emergency fund have totaled 724 million fund costs include the direct cost of the coast guard and 27 other federal partners as well as over 7 million in funding that has been provided to 14 different state agencies for state response efforts while we exercised our onetime advancement authority to move 100 million from the parent fund to the emergency fund the emerging scale of this enormous response effort is burning through those funds this is important because while the responsible party may be reimbursing emergency fund cost those reimbursements go back into the parent fund not the emergency fund we believe that we may exhaust the existing balance in the emergency fund as early as june 5 much earlier than previously forecast legislation is on the hill to allow for additional advancement authority and it is critical that we obtain that authority as soon as possible as the responsible party bp is advertising and paying claims for the removal costs and damages that result from this spill to date bp has reportedly received over 25000 claims and paid over 28 million most of these claims have been for loss of income and wages to individuals small businesses and fishermen as of yesterday bp has reportedly opened 28 claims processing centers with over 432 personnel in the field to assist claimants and has established a 1800 number as well as webbased claims submission capability bp currently has the capacity to accept 6000 claims per day and advises that it can surge quickly to a capacity of 15000 claims per day putting over 2500 adjusters in the field if necessary my staff is in daily conversation with bp executives regarding any concerns that are brought to our attention regarding claimants efforts to submit their claims a central tenet of opa 90 is that the polluter pays federal response costs are being accounted for and will be billed to bp and other responsible parties and guarantors under opa we anticipate frequent periodic billings and prompt payment going forward the administration will continue response we have sustained since the first day of this incident individuals communities and businesses have suffered as a result of this spill the opa regime is working to ensure a robust federal response that those damaged from this spill are compensated and the polluter pays the department supports the administrations legislative proposal and we look forward to working with congress to adjust the opa regime appropriately thank you for the opportunity to testify today i look forward to your questions the prepared statement of mr bennett follows prepared statement of craig bennett director national pollution fund center united states coast guard good morning chairman bingaman and distinguished members of the committee i am grateful for the opportunity to testify before this committee on the subject of the bp deepwater horizon oil spill currently ongoing in the gulf of mexico on the evening of april 20 2010 the transoceanowned bp chartered marshall islandsflagged mobile offshore drilling unit modu deepwater horizon located approximately 72 miles southeast of venice louisiana reported an explosion and fire onboard this began as a search and rescue sar missionwithin the first few hours 115 of the 126 crewmembers were safely recovered sar activities continued through april 23rd though the other 11 crewmembers remain missing concurrent with the sar effort the response to extinguishing the fire and mitigating the impacts of the approximate 700000 gallons of diesel fuel onboard began almost immediately in accordance with the operators minerals management service mmsapproved response plan oil spill response resources including oil spill response vessels osrvs were dispatched to the scene after two days of fighting the fire the modu sank into approximately 5000 feet of water on april 22nd on april 23rd remotely operated vehicles rovs located the modu on the seafloor and on april 24th bp found the first two leaks in the riser pipe and alerted the federal government rovs continue to monitor the flow of oil as the event unfolded a robust incident command system ics response organization was stood up in accordance with the national response framework nrf and the national oil and hazardous substances pollution contingency plan ncp ics is utilized to provide a common method for developing and implementing tactical plans to efficiently and effectively manage the response to oil spills the ics organization for this response includes incident command posts and unified commands at the local level and a unified area command at the regional level it is comprised of representatives from the coast guard federal on scene coordinator fosc other federal state and local agencies as well as bp as a responsible party the federal government has addressed the gulf oil spill with an allhandson deck approach from the moment the explosion occurred during the night of april 20ththe date of the explosiona command center was set up on the gulf coast to address the potential environmental impact of the event and to coordinate with all state and local governments after the modu sank on the 22nd the national response team nrt led by the secretary of homeland security and comprised of 16 federal agencies including the coast guard other dhs offices the environmental protection agency epa national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa department of interior doi as well as regional response teams rrt were activated on april 29 secretary napolitano declared the event a spill of national significance sons which enhanced operational and policy coordination at the national level and concurrently allowed admiral allens appointment as the national incident commander nic for the administrations continued coordinated response the nics role is to coordinate strategic communications national policy and resource support and to facilitate collaboration with key parts of the federal state and local government the nic staff is comprised of subject matter experts from across the federal government allowing for immediate interagency collaboration approval and coordination while the fosc maintains authorities for response operations as directed in the national contingency plan the nics primary focus is providing nationallevel support to the operational response this means providing the unified command with everything that they needfrom resources to policy decisionsto sustain their efforts to secure the source and mitigate the impact this will be a sustained effort that will continue until the discharges are permanently stopped and the effects of the spill are mitigated to the greatest extent possible beyond securing the source of the spill the unified command is committed to minimizing the economic and social impacts to the affected communities and the nation unified recovery efforts the unified command continues to attack the spill offshore as of may 13 2010 over 5 million gallons of oily water have been successfully recovered using mechanical surface cleaning methods further approximately over 704000 of surface dispersants have been applied to break up the slick and controlled burns have been used as weather conditions have allowed in addition to the ongoing offshore oil recovery operations significant containment and exclusion booms have been deployed and staged strategically throughout the gulf region these booms are used to protect sensitive areas including environmental and cultural resources and critical infrastructure as identified in the applicable area contingency plans acps to date more than a million feet of boom have been positioned to protect environmentally sensitive areas fourteen staging areas have been established across the gulf coast states and three regional command centers the secretary of defense approved the requests of the governors of alabama up to 3000 florida up to 2500 louisiana up to 6000 and mississippi up to 6000 to use their national guard forces in title 32 us code status to help in the response to the oil spill volunteerism and communication with local communities a critical aspect of response operations is active engagement and communication with the local communities several initiatives are underway to ensure regular communications with the local communities 1 active participation and engagement in town hall meetings across the region with industry and government involvement 2 daily phone calls with affected trade associations 3 coordination of public involvement through a volunteer registration hotline 18664485816 alternative technology products and services email horizonsupportaolcom and response and safety training scheduled and

in addition to coast guard safety and design standards mms and the occupational safety and health administration osha also have safety requirements for modus mms governs safety and health regulations in regard to drilling and production operations in accordance 30 cfr part 250 and osha maintains responsibility for certain hazardous working conditions not covered by either the coast guard or mms as per 29 usc sec 653 a and b1 coast guardmms joint investigation responsibilities on april 27th secretary napolitano and secretary of the interior ken salazar signed the order that outlined the joint coast guardmms investigation into the deepwater horizon incident information gathering began immediately after the explosion investigators from both agencies launched a preliminary investigation that included evidence collection interviews witness statements from surviving crew members and completion of chemical tests of the crew the aim of this investigation is to gain an understanding of the causal factors involved in the explosion fire sinking and tragic loss of 11 crewmembers the joint investigation will include public hearings which have already begun in kenner la the formal joint investigation team consists of equal representation of coast guard and mms members the coast guard has also provided subject matter experts and support staff to assist in the investigation lessons learned from past responses the coast guard has been combating oil and hazardous materials spills for many years in particular the 1989 major oil spill from the exxon valdez yielded comprehensive spill preparedness and response responsibilities in the 20 years since the exxon valdez the coast guard has diligently addressed the nations mandates and needs for better spill response and coordination for example a sons exercise is held every three years in 2002 the sons exercise was held in new orleans to deal with the implications of a wellhead loss in the gulf of mexico in that exercise the sons team created a vertically integrated organization to link local response requirements to a rrt the requirements of the rrt are then passed to the nrt in washington dc thereby integrating the spill management and decision processes across the federal government the response protocols used in the current response are a direct result of past lessons learned from real world events and exercises including sons although the exxon valdez spill shaped many of the preparedness and response requirements and legislation followed to this day other significant events since 1989 have generated additional lessons learned that have shaped our response strategies for example the mv cosco busan discharged over 53000 gallons of fuel oil into san francisco bay after colliding with the san franciscooakland bay bridge in heavy fog through the recovery of over 40 percent of the spilled product the unified command recognized improvements were needed in some areas as a result new guidance and policy was developed to better utilize volunteers in future responses additionally standard operating procedures for emergency notifications were improved to ensure better vertical communications between the federal responders and local governments furthermore steps were taken to preidentify incident command posts icps and improve booming strategies for environmentally sensitive areas most recently the coast guard led a sons exercise in march 2010 nearly 600 people from over 37 agencies participated in the exercise this exercise scenario was based on a catastrophic oil spill resulting from a collision between a loaded oil tanker and a car carrier off the coast of portland maine the exercise involved response preparedness activities in portland me boston ma portsmouth nh portsmouth va and washington dc the response to the sons scenario involved the implementation of oil spill response plans and response organizational elements including two unified commands a unified area command and the nic in accordance with the national contingency plan and national response framework the exercise focused on three nationallevel strategic objectives 1 implement response organizations in applicable oil spill response plans 2 test the organizations ability to address multiregional coordination issues using planned response organizations 3 communicate with the public and stakeholders outside the response organization using applicable organizational components the sons 2010 exercise was considered a success highlighting the maturity of the interagency and private oil spill response capabilities and the importance of nationallevel interactions to ensure optimal information flow and situational awareness the timely planning and execution of this nationallevel exercise have paid huge dividends in the response to this potentially catastrophic oil spill in the gulf of mexico role of the oil spill liability trust fund the oil spill liability trust fund osltf established in the treasury is available to pay the expenses of federal response to oil pollution under the federal water pollution control act fwpca33 usc sec 1321c and to compensate claims for oil removal costs and certain damages caused by oil pollution as authorized by the oil pollution act of 1990 opa 33 usc sec 2701 et seq these osltf uses will be recovered from responsible parties liable under opa when there is a discharge of oil to navigable waters adjoining shorelines or the exclusive economic zone eez the osltf is established under revenue code section 9509 26 usc sec 9509 which also describes the authorized revenue streams and certain broad limits on its use the principal revenue stream is an 8 cent per barrel tax on oil produced or entered into the united states see the tax provision at 26 usc sec 4611 the barrel tax increases to 9 cents for one year beginning on january 1 2017 the tax expires at the end of 2017 other revenue streams include oil pollutionrelated penalties under 33 usc sec 1319 and sec 1321 interest earned through treasury investments and recoveries from liable responsible parties under opa the current osltf balance is approximately 16 billion there is no cap on the fund balance but there are limits on its use per oil pollution incident the maximum amount that may be paid from the osltf for any one incident is 1 billion of that amount no more than 500 million may be paid for natural resource damages 26 usc sec 9509c2 opa further provides that the osltf is available to the president for certain purposes 33 usc sec 2712a these include payment of federal removal costs consistent with the ncp this use is subject to further appropriation except the president may make available up to 50 million annually to carry out 33 usc sec 1321c federal response authority and to initiate the assessment of natural resource damages this socalled emergency fund amount is available until expended if funding in the emergency fund is deemed insufficient to fund federal response efforts an additional 100 million may be advanced one time from the osltf subject to notification of congress no later than 30 days after the advance see 33 usc

npfc is a coast guard unit that manages use of the emergency fund for federal removal and trustee costs to initiate natural resource damage assessment the npfc also pays qualifying claims against the osltf that are not compensated by the responsible party damages include real and personal property damages natural resource damages loss of subsistence use of natural resources lost profits and earnings of businesses and individuals lost government revenues and net costs of increased or additional public services that may be recovered by a state or political subdivision of a state in a typical scenario the fosc coast guard or epa accesses the emergency fund to carry out 33 usc sec 1321c ie to remove an oil discharge or prevent or mitigate a substantial threat of discharge of oil to navigable waters the adjoining shoreline or the eez costs are documented and provided to npfc for reconciliation and eventual cost recovery against liable responsible parties federal trustees may request funds to initiate an assessment of natural resource damages and the npfc will provide those funds from the emergency fund as well opa provides that all claims for removal costs or damages shall be presented first to the responsible party any person or government may be a claimant if the responsible party denies liability for the claim or the claim is not settled within 90 days after it is presented a claimant may elect to commence an action in court against the responsible party or to present the claim to the npfc for payment from the osltf opa provides an express exception to this order of presentment in respect to state removal cost claims such claims are not required to be presented first to the responsible party and may be presented direct to the npfc for payment from the osltf these and other general claims provisions are delineated in 33 usc sec 2713 and the implementing regulations for claims against the osltf in 33 cfr part 136 npfc maintains information to assist

underlying the opa nevertheless the osltf is intended to pay even when a responsible party does not pay osltf and the deepwater horizon on may 12th the administration proposed a legislative package that will enable the deepwater horizon oil spill response to continue expeditiously speed assistance to people affected by this spill and strengthen and update the oil spill liability system to better address catastrophic events the bill would permit the coast guard to obtain one or more advancesup to 100 million eachfrom the principal fund within the oil spill liability trust fund to underwrite federal response activities taken in connection with the discharge of oil that began in 2010 in connection with the explosion on and sinking of the mobile offshore drilling unit deepwater horizon to deal more generally with the harms created by oil spills as well as to toughen and update these laws the bill would for any single incident raise the statutory expenditure limitation for the oil spill liability trust fund from 1 billion to 15 billion and the cap on natural resource damage assessments and claims from 500 million to 750 million in order to help those impacted by the oil spill get claims and benefits quickly the legislative package proposes workforce investment act provisions which would assist states in providing onestop services for those affected by the oil spill including filing claims with bp filing unemployment insuranceoil spill unemployment assistance claims accessing job placement training and workforce services accessing snap child care or other social service benefits and applying for sba disaster loans the emergency fund has been accessed by the fosc for 68 million as of may 23 2010 bp a responsible party is conducting and paying for most response activities the coast guard requested and received an advance of 100 million from the osltf principal fund to the emergency fund as authorized by 33 usc sec 2752b because the balance remaining in the emergency fund was not adequate to fund anticipated federal removal costs bp and transocean have been notified of their responsibility to advertise to the public the process by which claims may be presented as of may 24th 23960 claims have been opened with bp and nearly 28 million has been disbursed though transocean has also already been designated as a responsible party all claims are being processed centrally through bp conclusion through the national incident command we are ensuring all capabilities and resourcesgovernment private and commercialare being leveraged to protect the environment and facilitate a rapid robust cleanup effort every effort is being made to secure the source of the oil remove the oil offshore protect the coastline include and inform the local communities in support of response operations and mitigate any impacts of the discharge thank you for the opportunity to testify today i look forward to your questions the chairman thank you all very much ill start with a few questions mr perrelli as i understood your testimony your position the administrations position is that we should eliminate the cap on liability that is currently in the law and not have any cap is that correct mr perrelli i think its important to realize that opa covers a wide range of activitiessmall vessels large vessels but with respect to activities that might have the risk of resulting in a similar major oil spill such as we are seeing currently we dont think there should be an arbitrary cap on corporate responsibility the chairman let me askmr hayes do you agree with that position or is that something that interior is still assessing mr hayes we are totally in line with the department of justice on this mr chairman the chairman all right mr hayes the administration the chairman mr hayes let me change subjects just slightly here there continue to be reports in the media about permits being issued for drilling in the gulf and waivers being issued with regard to environmental requirements we have tried to nail this down i believe thesecretary salazar indicated that the position that he had taken and that the administration had taken is that there would be no additional drilling permitted in the gulf until some of these studies and investigations have been done could you clarify in short terms where we stand on that what operations are still being permitted which operations have been suspended or stopped mr hayes sure id be happy to and i appreciate the chance to clarify this mr chairman first let me say that as youll recall from last week there is a requirement that the minerals management service act on exploration plans within 30 days under the outer continental shelf lands act thats the area where the categorical exclusions have been used because of that statutory requirement exploration plans continue to be approved but those do not allow for drilling the drilling decision is a later decision under an apd there has to be a special affirmative act to allow for drilling as for the drilling the department put a stop on processing new apd permits after the chairman now mr hayes continuing april 20 the chairman continuing specify apd for those of us who are not experts mr hayes application for permit to drill the chairman all right mr hayes there are basically 2 types of drilling permits if you will there is the initial apd that gives you the authority to put a new hole in the ground then there can be situations where after you have started drilling there are safety issues that arise or other circumstances that arise that require you as a driller to move that ongoing drilling operation around those are called sidetracks revised permits to drill bypass permits those are all for ongoing alreadystarted drilling activities what the department has stopped is approving new apds for current drilling activities where theres a need foroften for safety reasonsto do a bypass or to do whats called a sidetrack those have been approved but those are not new apds thats thei think has risenis the reason for the lack of clarity but therein the deep water there have not been any new apds implemented since april 20 there were 2 that were approved between april 20 and may 6 they were both suspended no apds that have been filed since april 20 have been allowed to go forward and do new deepwater drilling the chairman thank you for clarifying that let me ask thesort of the other side of the coin with when were talking about possible liability limits the other side of the coin seems to me to be requirements for financial responsibility what are we going to require there for companies that go into the deep water and drill id ask mr hayes if you have a position on that mr hayes we agree with senator whitehouse that its appropriate toand your point in your opening statement mr chairmanthat its appropriate to revisit that financial assurance requirement that seems anachronistic frankly 150 million financial assurance certainly for a situation like this for a company like bp fortunately it does not appear to be coming into play here but we do think its appropriate just as we look at potentially revising upwards the statutory penalties we look at revising upwards the financial assurance requirements the chairman senator murkowski senator murkowski thank you very much mr chairman mr perrelli mr hayes i just wanted to make sure that i understood clearly your statements to the chairman is it correct to state then that both of you would agree that we should not have the current 75million liability cap that it should be an unlimited cap mr perrelli i thinkfor the future for activities such as deepwater drilling where there is a risk of a similar major oil spill i think we think that there should not be senator murkowski so are mr perrelli continuing that cap senator murkowski continuing are you differentiating between deepwater and shallowwater exploration and mr perrelli i think well need to work with the congress and the committee on the whole range of activities that are subject to opasmall vessels large vessels shallowwater drilling deeperwater drilling but certainly in the context of any activity that could result in a similar major oil spill our senator murkowski but mr perrelli continuing our view is there should not be an arbitrary cap senator murkowski but there should be some assessment of risk and some analysis then that plays in there mr perrelli certainly we should look at the risks and look at transition rules as well senator murkowski mr hayes i want to make sure that im not misinterpreting your statement mr hayes im on all fours with mr perrelli senator its always good to pay attention to your lawyer senator murkowski let me ask youboth of you have stated this morning and certainly your boss mr hayessecretary salazarhas made very very clear that bp as the responsible party will be paying and that bp doesnt expect to be held to the cap so if in fact it is correct here that theres no doubt that the responsible party is going to be held fully accountable for this particular spill does the administration think then that we need any specific legislation to make this true to ensure that this is in fact the case mr perrelli i think we are going continue to work to ensure that bp lives up to its commitments so they have made that commitment we take it seriously and we will work with them to ensure that they do so i think our focus on the legislative proposal is transition into a new liability regime senator murkowski so basically going forward mr perrelli yes were focused on going forward senator murkowski let me ask about that because as the 75million strict liability cap is in place now it only applies in cases where theres been no gross negligence willful misconduct or regulatory noncompliance so im assuming that there is a possibility or a likelihood that any of these 3 faults can be alleged in which case the liability capped is removed altogether mr perrelli thats correct senator senator murkowski ok so in fact what were talking about here with a cap may or may notand the may not is perhaps quite likelymay not be in place for this particularfor the deepwater horizon incident mr perrelli i certainly dont want to speculate as to where the facts may lead but under opa if theres gross negligence or violation of any safety operational or construction regulation that may have caused this spill the caps would be removed senator murkowski i wont ask you to speculate but i will ask you if the department of justice is aware at this point in time of any incident instance either proven or alleged of the responsible parties engaging in gross negligence willful misconduct or regulatory noncompliance mr perrelli senator i dont want to comment on any pending or contemplated investigation there are many facts yet to be developed so i cant give you any insight on that currently senator murkowski let me ask you mr bennett because when we were in louisiana yesterday had an opportunity to hear from representatives from the fishing industry the small charter boat industry as well as the oyster fishermen and there was a discussion about what is happening with the processing of claims and there was concern that in fact claims were being expedited that there was a process that was transparent and that worked for those that had been affected whether within their businesses in being able to go out and fish or charter bookings that had been canceled the question to you is in your offices role of overseeing this claims process are we sure that weve got thea sufficient number of claims offices that we have staffing that is sufficient that we have a staff that can deal withfor instance weve got a big vietnamese community within the shrimping industry do we have translators there are we fully set up the secretary of the interior was pretty adamant yesterday that there would be followup meetings with admiral landry he volunteered himself to go down there as a part of a followup meeting becausewhat we heard was that in fact the process that is being set up is not meeting the needs of the local people can you comment on that mr bennett yes senator ill be glad to by opa our the law requires us to require the responsible party to advertise and collect claims bps been very responsive beyond the law in our questions or our direction toas we oversee and make sure that theyre complying with taking claims theyvewe welcome any complaints or any concerns about the claimant process we are not getting a lot of concerns sent to my office so if youre hearing that i do want to know about it my executives talk to bps daily about their claim processes as i said theyve opened 28 offices theyve been opening capacity at a rate of about 28 percent and the claims growth has grown at a rate of about 12 percent and its leveling off now itll probably pick up once oil comes ashore and we start getting more damage claims but itbut the capacity to take 6000 claims a daytheyre currently getting about 2000 claims a day they can surge to a capacity of 15000 claims a day so again this is industrieswhat theyre telling us but it appears from what we know the data that we have that theyre meeting the requirement as soon as we got word about vietnamese and spanish and croatian communities we approached bp and said we expect you to handle that they immediately got translator services and they immediately started advertising the next day in local community newspapers and media so bp has been responsive to any of our requests or direction from any concerns that we become aware of senator murkowski youre probably going to be hearing about this meeting thank you mr chairman senator dorgan presiding let me askthe comment that was just made that bp has indicated that it intends to pay all legitimate claimsobviously the question ism whats legitimate but aside from that is bps representation legally binding in any way legally binding on them theyve simply indicated that they would intend to pay legitimate claims so 6 months or a year from now is that a legally binding commitment mr perrelli i dont want to make a judgment as to how that commitment might be viewed in a court of law down the road theyve certainly made that commitment very publically as well as publically committed not simply to pay claims beyond the 75 million but not to seek recourse against the fund which is also a significant commitment so we intendwhether its in a court of law or elsewherewe certainly intend to have them uphold that commitment senator dorgan so you intend to represent that commitment as something thats binding mr perrelli as i said i cant speak to whether or not it would be binding in a court of law if we were to litigate this down the road senator dorgan thats the reason i asked the question is obviously thats pretty important in the middle of this crisis while the gusher is still flowing on the ocean floor the representation today might be very different than the actions 6 months or a year from now so i appreciate the fact that bp has made these representations id feel more comfortable if there were some binding requirements here or they were legally binding let me ask about another topic it is about a letter that youve received at the justice department from about 18 of us recently and it asks you to take a look at an announcement by transocean limited the owner of the deepwater horizon oil rig transocean is headquartered in switzerland by the way where it has a dozen employees and it has 1300 employees in houston but they moved to switzerland most likely to reduce its tax obligation to the united states so in switzerland it announces that itsintends to distribute 1 billion to its shareholders at this point in time is that troublesome to you weve written a letter asking whether its troublesome because there may be substantial liability here for transocean because of this spill as well if they go ahead and distribute that 1 billion in the face of potential liability wouldnt that be a pretty difficult circumstance for a lot of people whose lives have been dramatically affected to see mr perrelli senator i dont think ive actually seen a copy of the letter although ive been told that it was sent i think our focus isfrom all of the responsible parties or anybody whos potentially liable to recover every dime for the taxpayer so regardless of whether transocean or another responsible party has spent funds our goal is going to be to get back every dime for the american taxpayer senator dorgan yes well you will just have received this then would you take a hard look at this letter it does raise real questions at a previous hearing we had at this table 3 parties each of which were pointing in the other direction saying well it wasnt our fault it was somebody elses fault one of which was transocean i notice in their location in switzerland they want to give a billion dollars back to their shareholders at a time when i think there might be very substantial liability questions that would suggest wed want them to have that money available you talk also about the issue of liability for offshore oil and gas development and i think you talked about that mr hayes you talked about significant increases in liability as well mr perrelli the significant increases obviously will affect different companies in different ways i think you alluded just a moment ago it may well have decision points with respect to whether its a shallow or a deep well the size of the project size of the company and so on describe for us if you will what your thinking is going forward with respect to liability significant increases does that suggest that you believe there ought to be a cap on liability requirements for companies if so what would the conditions be that attach to a cap mr perrelli the legislative proposal that the administration sent up was structured requiring entities of all sizes to pay all removal costs plus some amount of damages yet to be determined we want to very much work with the committee and look at the different factors look at for different types of oil exploration or transport the factors needed to ensure that companies invest sufficiently in safety the factors needed to ensure that the funds at the end of the day are sufficient to make sure that all claims are all paid out i think we also want to look at the market impacts that may affect different kinds of entities that may be involved in you know transport of small amounts of oil on a coastline versus drilling in very deep water we think those are different activities each one requires a little bit different look senator dorgan let me go back to this other point are there ways that you could take steps to make legally binding the statement by bp or at least ask them to make this legally binding at this point no 1 no 2 thats the one side of potential liability the other side is a billion dollars being disbursed to shareholders at a time when you may want to see that it is available for liability on transocean are you interested in working on both of those to see that the folks who are affected by this oil spill are protected mr perrelli i will ill take that back and well give that further consideration senator senator dorgan all right senator sessions senator sessions thank you mr perrelli to walk through thisthe statue that provides liability coverage it has some good things in it i believe that it can be improved and ive offered legislation to do that with regard to the damages of cleanup the cost of all the cleanup is there any question that the responsible partythis case bpis responsible for all the cleanup costs the marshes the beaches and that kind of thing mr perrelli senator theres no question that theyre responsible for all the removal costs senator sessions with regard to the 75million category is this a loss of profits that shrimpers or fishermen may have potential beachesrentals that get canceled and those kind of things is that what is capped under this bill mr perrelli what the 75million cap applies to if it applies as we talked beforethere are many situations in which it would notit applies to a wide range of damages and that includes the kinds of economic damages that you were discussing the cost of public services that may be required in response to a disaster such as this as well as damage to natural resources the impact once the oil is removed of trying to revive that habitat thats an area where in prior oil spills there have been very significantin the hundreds of millions of dollars of impact on natural resources senator sessions but on classical state law that has not be abrogated this is the kind of lawsuits one might file under federal law in federal court i presume that were talking about the 700 million in the total cleanup costs but there are possibilities that under classical state pollution or nuisance or trespasstype actions you could file those lawsuits also mr perrelli opa expressly allows states to impose greater liability or requirements thats correct senator senator sessions legislationive worked with senator vitter and wethe legislation that i signed onto does have retroactive liability alterations in the act i know senator dorgan just said should we do this i have heard some complaints or concerns really that this raises constitutional questions about the ability of congress to retroactively alter this situation does the department of justice have an opinion about that mr perrelli ill start first by noting that there would be many situations in whichfor example if the cap didnt applythere wouldnt be a concern about retroactivity but congress legislates retroactively all the time i thinkwhile we think that there would be arguments that might be made under the takings clause and other provisions we think we would have pretty strong arguments in response that congress in legitimately legislating in order to ensure cleanup and compensation would not run afoul of constitutional protections senator sessions do youwhat would expect that to be contested mr perrelli one could envision it could be contested either as a constitutional matter or in a breach of contract action which might actually be more likely senator sessions mr perrelli with regard to the investigations that are ongoingi know mms and i believe coast guard maybe has people on that teamto what extent is the fbi involved in that mr perrelli senator i can not comment on any contemplated or pending investigation senator sessions i would just suggest if there is a possibility of a criminal investigation and everyone is presumed innocent but if there is the fbi should be involved in that my observation is that their expertise in those kind of matters exceed agency investigators although they have great skills in many ways with regard to the shallowwater drilling mr bennett is that within your jurisdiction we do have thousands of jobs that i understand will soon end if all shallowwater drilling is stopped because it doesnt take long to get one of those wells completed and the ones already ongoing are soon wrapping up what is your expectation with how long it will take to make a decision about that mr hayes senator ill take that one foron behalf of the secretary of the interior the policy statement that i described to and clarified with the chairman is in place only until the 30day report is delivered to the president later this week so this was essential a timeout on the drilling of new deepwater wells in particular after may 6 though we are alsostopped approving shallowwaterdrilling apds as well but thats just until the end of the week so the issue has been raised appropriately as to what should happen after this safety report gets delivered to the president were looking at that issue and are cognizant of the fact that there are important distinctions between shallowwater and deepwater risks senator sessions thank you the chairman presiding senator wyden senator wyden thank you mr chairman mr perrelli at our hearing 2 weeks ago i laid out a pattern of horrific safety problems at bp today i want to talk about the recent pattern of actions taken by the transocean company since the accident in the gulf let me walk you very specifically through the timetable at our hearing 2 weeks ago the top management of transocean said that they had nothing to do with the accident they said it was bps fault they in effect were just following bps orders two days after our hearing in the committee after they absolved themselves of responsibility transocean went off to federal court in houston there they filed a claim under american admiralty law that governs maritime accidents and they said again they arent liable but if they are their liability ought to be capped at 267 million on the day after that on may 14 transocean announced at the shareholders meeting in switzerland that they are going to distribute 1 billion in profits to shareholders given that pattern of activityand i had followed it since our hearingi went out and put together this letter with 17 of our colleagues as cosigners asking you all to investigate by the way we told the administrationnot only did we send it to you all we told you that i was going ask about ask about it this morning so the departments been on notice heres my questionis would you agree that transocean shifting a billion dollars in funds from the company to its shareholders and its federal court filing under the admiralty laws could possibly be a way for transocean to either evade or limit its liability mr perrelli let me respond by focusing particularly on the limitation of liability action in which although we are not a party to that action we have already responded to transocean and i imagine that we will also make a filing in that case explaining in the strongest possible terms that what transocean is attempting to do there is inappropriate the 1851 senator wyden but you believe what transocean is doing is inappropriate mr perrelli the filing of the limitation of liability action senator wyden all right mr perrelli continuing seeking to limit their liability to 26 million the statute that they are seeking to use is a statute perhaps best known as being the statute used by the owners of the titanic to attempt to limit their liability congress when it enacted opa expressly said that the limitation of liability act does not limit liabilities under opa and further said it expressly doesnt limit the liabilities that states may impose for oil pollution activities senator wyden what does the department intend to do in response to the recent pattern of activity by transocean seems to me that whats going on here is pretty clear for a company that said it did nothing wrong this company is working pretty hard to insulate itself from being held responsible for an accident involving its own drill rig and crew it seems to me this is an area where the department really needs to dig in and do a thorough investigation are you all prepared to do that mr perrelli as i indicated i cant comment on any pending or contemplated investigation but i will say that on this question of whether they can limit their liability through this action that they have filed we believe in the strongest possible terms and well make that clear that they can not senator wyden i certainly hope that you will look into this thoroughly because given what they said before the committee given the fact that just in a matter of days they went out and took this action then went forward and delivered in effect you know the dividendi mean it seems to me this is a pattern of activity that requires that the department look into this thoroughly because the decision to transfer this enormous amount of money out of its own countaccount as a profit given all the events that had taken place in recent weeks suggests to me that if the government doesnt look into this the government is simply not following through in an area that i think is central for the government to have credibility in terms of its response to the tragedy in the gulf so i appreciate youre saying that their conduct is inappropriate i hope youll look into this you know thoroughly because this pattern of activityand i consider it a pattern literally from the weeks since they came here strikes me as unacceptable i cant say that it is illegal at this point but it certainly ought to be unacceptable given the tragedy that weve seen in the gulf thank you mr chairman the chairman senator barrasso senator barrasso thank you very much mr chairman mr chairman thank you for holding this hearing you know i think the headline from yesterdays wall street journal tells it all it says us was not ready for major oil spill despite mature offshore operations gulf crews are improvising with chemicals protective boom and outdated mapsoutdated maps today is day 36 oil continues gushing into the gulf no one is really sure how much oil is leaking we were first told it was 1000 barrels a day then it looked like 5000 barrels a day but now scientists say that the number may be much higher the cloud of confusion over how much oil is spilling into the gulf is very concerning and its also very unclear who is in charge i mean here is todays washington post front page administration torn on getting tough with bp administration torn on getting tough with bp secretary salazar says bp has missed deadline after deadline secretary salazar says that if bp is not doing what theyre supposed to be doing well push them out of the way but just yesterday the coast guard commandant thad allen said to push bp out of the way it would raise the question to replace them with what thats why it is hard to tell who is in charge the response seems to be delayed weve tried many different things from the top hat to the junk shot to the undersea straw during testimony just last week to this committee secretary salazar promised that last saturday or sunday triggers would be pulled to try the dynamic kill saturday passed sunday passed no sign of a dynamic kill so 36 days still no solution the american people want to know if the administration is dithering while us coastal communities are engulfed in oil public anger truly is growing the american people are angry angry at bp and angry at the administration the administrations confused response stands in contrast to public anger the administration likes to say that it will quote keep the boot on the throat of bp its time to use the other boot to actually stop the spill bp clearly bears the brunt of the responsibility for this spill bp is responsible for paying for all of the cleanup regardless of cost but the white house and the administration has some responsibility there are lapses in regulatory enforcement the second story in the washington post today us oil drilling agency ignored risk warnings officials bypass laws protecting environment documents show so the spill occurred in federal waters the federal government owns the underground oil so my question mr hayes at what point does the administration take complete control to protect our communities and our coastline mr hayes mr senator commandant thad allen is the national incident commander operating on behalf of the administration and the government under the laws that this congress passed the oil pollution act of 1990 to supervise all cleanup activities he is the national incident commander he is in charge bp is paying for and implementing under his charge the cleanup responsibilities senator barrasso can you then talk to us about the upcoming plan if there is one for this dynamic kill mr hayes i can secretary chu is in houston as we speak today the final preparations are being implemented for a dynamic kill attempt thatif todays procedures go well and the pressure testing proves sound a decision will be made late tonight or early tomorrow morning to attempt the dynamic kill tomorrow senator barrasso thank you thank you mr chairman the chairman senator sanders senator sanders thank you mr chairman i think we all understand that we are looking at one of the most significant ecological disasters in the modern history of our country we understand that nobody can fully estimate what either the economic or ecological damages will be all of this takes place i must say at a time when the american people are having significant doubts about bp and transocean we are looking at a multinational corporationbp which earned 56 billion in the first quarter of this year were looking at a company which many americans are now believing ignored many safety factors as they proceeded rapidly in order to move that project along were looking at a company which denied refused to put information out there we still do not know today how much oil is leaking we were told 1000 barrels a day there are estimates now that it may be 100 times that we still dont know we see a company which many americans think isbeen not been aggressive in attempting to stop the flowor effective for sureor in proceeding forwardgoing forward with the cleanup now i want to get back to mr perrelli and ask you a very very simple question i think youve dodged it a little bit should we eliminate the cap completely and hold bp 100 percent responsible so that they pick up all of the economic damages as well as the environmental damages very simple question yes or no mr perrelli senator bp has said theyre committed to doing that senator sanders oh oh let meim sorry mr perrelli continuing i think as i indicated our proposal to lift the cap is focused on the future as i indicated to senator sessions however we also think that we would have strong arguments if congress ultimately decided to senator sanders no but what is yourthats not a good answer to be honest with you in the sense that what bp said doesnt mean much you may be the last person in america who trusts or believe what bp says it doesnt matter a year from now the tv cameras will not be there some fisherman is going to have to go to court to try to get damages from bp a multibilliondollar corporation this guy doesnt stand a chance now is the moment do we lift the cap or do we not whats the answer mr perrelli as i indicated our proposal to lift the cap is focused on the future senator sanders so it is not dealing with bp it is as i hear itcorrect me if im wrongyour position is that we should not lift the cap on bp for this oil spill mr perrelli as i indicated we are focused on the proposals for the future thats our senator sanders mr chairman i would hope that this committee and the senate will move aggressively to move in a very different direction that the administration is indicating the taxpayersit is beyond comprehension that you have a oil company making over 5 billion in profits in the first quarter of this year at the same time as you have a nation running a recordbreaking deficit that the taxpayers of this country should be asked to pay one nickelone nickel in costs just because bp says somethingim glad you believe them but you may be one of the few people in america who trusts them mr perrelli senator i dont think its a question of belief here we are committed to recovering every single dime from bp as we talked about before there are many circumstances in which the cap will not apply we also recognize that there are many other statutes that may be available to pursue either penalties or damages from bp as well as state law so we think that we will be able to recover regardless of bps commitment every single dime that has been expended by the taxpayers senator sanders i think you are ignoring and making it moreyoure ignoring the best way to go forward by simply lifting the cap thats it thank you very much mr chairman the chairman senator bennett senator bennett thank you mr chairman thank you to the witnesses lets look ahead mr perrelli i appreciate your comment about that ill leave it atleave it to the experts to try to get this spill stopped and get everything under control but there are 2 views that i see with respect to the future one that says ok this happened because people were lax thats the headline that senator barrasso quoted either the company was lax or the regulators were lax or both were lax and thattherefore if we tighten up all of the procedures nothing of this sort will ever happen again the other view is hey accidents happen weve drilled thousands and thousands of these wells without any incident and statistically this is a very small percentage andof difficulty accidents happen with automobiles accidents happen with airplanes accidents are going to happen anytime you have a large number of activities of this kind id like reaction to that is this indeed just a very small percentage that accidents happen and so we can go statistically as far into the future as we have in the past andbefore we get another one of these or is this indeed a circumstance where there lax practices either on behalf of the company or the regulatori dont want to have to determine who was laxbut was there something here that could be prevented in the future then the second side of that if we do move in a direction that by virtue of the cap drives the nonmajors out of this business so that only the majors survive because only the majors will be big enough to deal with a cap what are the chances that they will be able to get sufficient insurance if the cap is set so high or if the cap is lifted altogether so that a business decision will be made by the board or boards of these companies the risk is too great and we will drop all activities as far as drilling is concerned look into the future in these 2 areas and give me your responses mr hayes youre probably the one whos thought about these issues the most so ill let you come first but anybody else who has a view about these 2 areas id like to get your response mr hayes thank you senator i would say that with regard to the first point this is an unusual accident thats clearly the case there were 2 independent serious things that went wrong the blowout on the one hand and the failure of the blowout preventer on the other each of those independently is extraordinarily rare to have them both happen at the same time is even more extraordinarily rare however its unacceptable for it to occur that is why we are committed to doing a thorough investigation and a topto bottom evaluation of whether we have the right regulatory system thewhether we are stateoftheart whether there is enough oversight of industry you will see later this week in the report that the secretary will be delivering to the president some ideas in terms of additional interim safety measures that we might considerthat the president might consider imposing because this type of accident rare though it is is unacceptable and must not be allowed to ever happen again that is our commitment to work with you and the congress to make sure we have a system in place so that we never have to deal with this again ill defer to mr perrelli on the second part of your question senator on the cap issue mr perrelli senator i think we learn unfortunately every day more information about the risks of offshore drilling i think that rethinking the liability provisions is appropriate as we learn more and more about the risks you raise a number of questions about insurance i would say that today the major players in this industry already are involved in a mix of insurance and selfinsurance they are todayfacing the prospect potentially of unlimited liability both because there are many circumstances in which the caps wouldnt apply but also because of state law and other law that is out there so i think that our fundamental starting point is that the polluter should pay where you have a risky activity that is highly lucrative in a place where the entity that is most able to ensure safety is going to be the company engaged in the activitywe think that its appropriate where theres the prospect of a similar major oil spill to not have a cap on liability senator bennett but youre going to drive toward concentration in the industry perhaps mr perrelli as i think weve talked about we think there are a lot of activities covered under opa and different liability regimes as under the current law may be appropriate i think our focus here is on where theres a prospect of a similar major oil spill i think most of that activityand mr hayes can talkmost of the deepwater activity is a much smaller set of players senator bennett thank you mr chairman the chairman thank you let me just advise folksthe order that folks have arrived in here is stabenow next then shaheen then menendez and landrieu then cantwell of course if some of our republican colleagues arrive theyll be inserted in that senator stabenow then we do have a second panel so let me just advise everybody that we would like to do all of that before lunch senator stabenow thank you mr chairman and i appreciate this hearing as an important part of the series of hearings weve been having i do feel compelled before asking a question to make an editorial comment because one of the things that i can see happening in terms of where we focus accountability is the fact that were not looking at more broadly the consequences of a philosophy of deregulation that has gone on now for many many years we see that on wall street we see that now with minerals management services we see that across the board theres an inspector general report out documenting the fact that there wereunscrupulous use of government funding from 2005 to 2007 too close to industries that they regulate i raise this only because this white house is dealing with holdovers from the former administration that believed in that deregulation backing up not having the accountability letting the industries basically make the decisions even thethe minerals management services chief who just stepped down was from the bush administration i mention that only because i can hear where this is going in terms of pressing that somehow this is all about the obama administration mr chairman we have 107 nominees pending right now that the president doesnt even have his own team in place so im happy to hold them accountable but lets give them their team first they dont even have their team in place i think that directly relates to what is going on here so i would sayi dont want to deal with the old team that was in place right now the holdovers from a philosophy frankly that has caused us a lot of trouble it causes a lot of problems that philosophy of deregulation and not protecting the public interest lets put the new team in place and let the president have his team andi mean im willing to be as tough as everas anyone on them let me talk about bp and ask your comments because when we look at the effortsat the history of bp it is very disturbing beyond this horrendous situation that we have right now in march 2005 an explosion at a bp facility in texas resulted in 15 deaths 170 injuries after an investigation it was determined that bp cut maintenance and safety controls in an effort to reduce costs the oil spill right now doesnt appear to be an isolated accidentor incident its part of a track record of cutting corners on safety that is frankly very concerning that has cost workers their lives last october osha again fined bp because they failed to correct safety hazards they found after that 2005 explosion as well as 439 new safety hazards found since then they were fined 20 million for a huge oil spill in alaska in 2006 because of a corroded pipeline according to a recent study bp refineries are responsible for 97 percent of all flagrant violations found by government inspectors in the refinery industry most of these citations from inspectors found that they weretheir behavior was egregious and willful so my question is given the track record at this point is there any reason or evidence to date that bp may have been grossly negligent or in violation of an applicable federal safety construction or operating regulation for any of the actions right now that would put them in a position to waive the current 75million cap mr perrelli senator you correctly state that those are circumstances in which the cap would not apply our focus to date has really been on cleanup and i dont want to comment on any contemplated or pending investigation on this matter from the justice department senator stabenow does anyone else want to comment i mean clearly this is a record of serious concerns about cutting costs raises a lot of questions about how we got into this situation without safety provisions put in place in case something like this happened even though weve been told this could never happen and thats why that we dont have the answer this has gone on for over a month because somehow it never was going to happen but it does raise serious questions about a number of different things i hope were going to focus on this in a much more direct way in the future yes mr hayes id be happy to just reinforce the notion senator that we intend to absolutely look at the entire bp record as part of the overall investigation that is now underway i fully expect the commission that the president announced last saturday will also look at whether theres a pattern here for this company and do a stemtostern evaluation of the adequacy of the regulatory program in that regard i appreciate your comment that the inspector general report that came out today reinforced the notion that prior to the time this administration took office there were serious problems at the minerals management service secretary salazar in the very first month of coming into the office established a new ethics procedure for mms the focus at that time was on the revenue side we stopwe ended the royaltyinkind program we required special ethics training the secretary today has asked the inspector general as a followup to that report to see if any ethical violations have continued in connection with the new orleans activities of the minerals management service the report the inspector general has does not indicate that they have continued but we want to make sure they have not continued this is definitely a work in progress as we deal with what has been too cozy a relationship as the president has said between industry and regulators senator stabenow thank you mr chairman the chairman thank you senator shaheen senator shaheen thank you mr chairman for holding for this hearing thank you gentlemen for being here theres been a lot of talk this morning about the oil pollution act of 1990 and about what the responsible party is required to pay under that act i think theres been general agreement from everybody whos spoken that bp would be liable to pay the costs of cleanup in the spill one of the big questions has been about the 75million liability cap i made some charts this morning because i thought it might be instructive to look at how that liability cap of 75 million compares to some of the costs involved in this spill so if we look at this first poster you can see at the bottom if you have a magnifying glass the 75 million in liability above that is the estimated damage to louisianas fishing industry which is right now estimated at 24 billion above that you can see the estimated damage to floridas tourism industry which is estimated at 3 billion above that is the dot that shows bps profits for the first quarter of this year 62 billion finally the large dot at the top are bps profits for 2009 which are 16188 billion i also thought it would be helpful to show how that 75 million fits into the total profits from bp for 2009 and i misspoke the profits were 166 billion but you can see that 75 million is a very tiny sliver of what bps profits were i think thats why youre hearing were all hearing so much concern this morning about that 75million liability cap so the question that i really haveand im proud to be on senator menendezs legislation to raise that liability cap to 10 billionbut the question thats been raised this morning is should we have a cap at all on liability does a cap encourage riskier behavior on the part of the industry i dont know mr perrelli if you would like to take first shot at that mr perrelli i think in a situation where you have the risk of a similar major oil spill you have activity that is risky itself but highly lucrative you have the companies that are engaged in it in the best position to invest in new technology to ensure its safer to ensure that they have sufficient staff ensure that they are complying with all of the federal regulations that is the situation where not having any cap i think we think makes a lot of sense and is consistent with the basic principle that polluters should pay for all of the damage that they cause senator shaheen thank you theres been a lot of talk about bp and bp has said they will pay the total cost of the cleanup i think most of us looking at the scenes on television would say that that cost of cleanup includes the cost of the booms the cost of you know people raking in the oil but what else is included in that cost of cleanup are all of the legal costs that the departmentthe attorney general is incurring right now included in that cost of cleanup is the time that the department of the interior is spending on this included in that cost of cleanup mr perrelli ill speak first and then maybe mr bennett can add to it but certainly the costs that are covered include public services expenditures by public services all of the damages to our natural resources all of the efforts of agencies to minimize or mitigate the impact of the oil the impact on subsistence uses of fish and the economic impact so it is a broad range of categories i will say that this is certainly unprecedented in its scope and there may be issues that arise that havent been dealt with before but certainly opa was intended to cover a broad range of costs and damages mr hayes ill just add as mr perrelli said damages include unreimbursed removal costs personal or property damages lost profits or earnings loss of government revenues cost of increased public services natural resource damages thats the damage side on the response side the federal onscene coordinator admiral landry is the authority for driving the response under the leadership of the national incident commander admiral allen so clearly under opa those response costs are determined by her so she needs somethingfor instance the national guard rollout were paying for out of the fund to support her and covering that cost the surge of government that youre seeing that were all part of is new ground as mr perrelli said we really havent ever done this before on that scale were still working through some of the public policy questions of if its clearly needed by the fosc and the nic a lot ofyou know getting teams of scientists together to evaluate dispersants or to evaluate flow ratesthats clearly something they need and wantits paid for if i were to go down and do a tour of the site i would pay out of coast guard operating costs because i dont consider myself part of the response senator shaheen thank you the chairman senator menendez senator menendez thank you mr chairman let me commend the administration for embracing an unlimited liability for economic damages flowing from an offshore rig spill at least for deepwater development i have been advocating we need to lift the cap and im going to amend my legislation to pursue unlimited liability certainly in this regard but i think we disagree about the question of retroactivity i want to ask mr perrelliunder the law not what bp has saidjust so i get this straightunder the law bp has beyond all of the natural resources cleanup and the cleanup and all of those efforts which i understand they will pay forbut after that when there is liability under the law right now they only have a 75million liability cap is that correct yes or no mr perrelli i wouldnt characterize it that way senator there is a cap but it is conditioned on a number of things including that there has to be no gross negligence and no violation of any safety operational or construction regulations so there are many circumstances in which the cap would not apply at all but in addition there are certainly other federal statutes at issue as well as state law that could be brought into play senator menendez then why would we have put aside a 75 million liability cap if all of these other elements could expose you unlimitedly mr perrelli opa when it was enacted among other things for example increased penalties under the clean water act as well as expressly left state law remedies of senator menendez in the absence of those exemptions that you describe they would have a 75million liability cap mr perrelli ifunder opa if those exceptions didnt occur there would be a 75million liability cap as i indicated senator menendez now mr perrelli continuing state law would still be available senator menendez continuing has bp entered into a consent agreement with the department of justice to agree to as they have verbalized and as the administration has said that they have verbalizedhas bp entered into consent agreement to be liable for above the 75million cap mr perrelli not as senator menendez have theygive you any written assurances that in fact they will be liable for above the 75million cap mr perrelli i believe theyve provided written assurances to the cabinet secretaries secretary napolitano and secretary salazar andas you knowat least the chairman i know made such statements to some congressional committees senator menendez id like to see if the department has a copy or if not mr hayes id like to see what was written whats the nature of the language of bps commitment senator menendez because exxon said all of thesemany of these same things during the exxon valdez then they litigated all the way to the supreme court forit took 20 years and individuals fell off along the way who were damaged simply because they could not sustain it let me ask you mr perrellisenator murkowski suggested is unlimited liability available under state law for this bill section 1018 of opa seems to allow state liability beyond federal caps for oil discharges but it says quote within such state would a spill like this in federal waters be considered a discharge within a state allowing increased state liability mr perrelli i think certainly a significant amount of damage to state coastlines and within a certain distance of the coastline would be damage to that state i think that out on the outer continental shelf the rules may be different but certainly there will be significant damages that a state might be able to pursue to its coastline senator menendez but there is no question that this is a discharge not within a state but in the territorial waters of the united states and federal waters is that correct mr perrelli thats where the initial discharge occurs but theres no question i think as we see every day that theres tremendous damage being done to the coastline senator menendez i have no disagreement with that but my point is that when we go to state liability it is a litigious process assuming that bp wants to be litigious along the way ultimately there are no guarantees so if we in fact believe that either between the exceptions that you stated may existwe dont know whether theyre pertinent to this particular incidentor bps statements that they are going to accept unlimited liability i dont see what the reticence is to liftto the unlimited liability certainly in deepwater drilling let me ask you one other question the inspector general of the department of the interior is soon releasing a report that describes regulators allowingat mmsto allowing company officials to fill out inspection forms in pencilcompany officialswhich inspectors would quote write on top of the pencil in ink and turn in complete forms this is just the latest in a series of allegations leveled at mms some of these have been referred to us attorneys and they have passed on it is the justice department going to look at these incidents and determine whether there is prosecutions that should be leveled mr perrelli senator i cant speak about this particular instance but if we get a referral from the inspector general of the department interior we will take a serious look senator menendez mr hayes do you intend to make a referral of the inspector generals report to the department of justice mr hayes we have just received this draft report from the ig last night and i expect the secretary will do exactly what he did when he came into office in january 2009 on the heels of the ig investigations in lakewood colorado he specifically referred everything to the us attorney even though that particular investigation had already been processed by the previous administration in this case the secretary issued a press release this morning making it clear that he intends to aggressively evaluate these activities all of which occurred under the prior administration but he intends to aggressively look into the individuals involved and to consider prosecution termination whatever is appropriate senator menendez i respect what the secretary has done in the ethics reforms that he has instituted i do hope that there is appropriate referrals to the justice department because only when we act seriously will the regulators understand that you cant ultimately be cozying up to the industry and doing what they want and putting us all at risk thank you mr chairman the chairman senator landrieu senator landrieu yes i want to go back to this liability question because senator menendez and others have recommended a cap i think for the whole offshore but he clarified just a moment ago for deepwater so im not sure but a cap of 10 billion mr perrelli you testifiedand mr hayesthat the administrations position is unlimited cap for deepwater is that correct mr perrelli senator for deepwater where theres a threat of a similar major oil senator landrieu so youre deepwater unlimited he may be deepwater 10 billion if that was in effect today can youcan this law this new law that we will considerwhether its unlimited as you have recommendedand the administrationor 10 billion as senator menendezdoes that go into effect for bp can we be retroactive in our laws mr perrelli we think that there would be strong arguments to say that congress could indeed impose it retroactively senator landrieu ok so you believe that theres constitutional grounds to be retroactive mr perrelli we think it would not violate the constitution we recognize that there would be litigation risk breach of contract actions could be brought but we think we would have strong arguments among other things opa itself has an express provision saying that congress may increase liability or requirements on oil companies senator landrieu so whether the congress moves to a10 billion cap as suggested by senator menendez and others or the unlimited cap as suggested by the administration do you think in the administrations view that you should have a different cap for deep water shallow water and then near shore because as you know this drilling can occur in 10 feet of water 1000 feet of water which is considered shallow and then deep which is 1000 to 5000 and then ultra deep over 5000 the risk of course are expediential in terms ofthat thosethat factor of depth distance darkness as thad allen has said so accurately so how is the administration thinking about this because its very important to thousands of people in the industry that dont drill in deepwater but have been drilling fairly safely in shallow wells whathave youare you thinking about the effect of your proposal on the industry as a whole mr perrelli i think we recognize as you indicated that opa covers a wide range of different activities that may have different risks we recognize that its complicated and there are many factors that have to be considered including what will create the best incentives for safety what will ensure that claims will be paid but the impact on the market as well so i think we would like to work with the congress on what are the appropriate liability provisions for different types of drilling or different types of transport i thinkoverall however i think that a primary point is the polluter pays should be at the core of this these liability provisions havent been changed in 20 years and i think we have learned that they are not sufficient for the risks we face today senator landrieu i agree with you on that that theyre not sufficient but i would call your attention to the wall street journal article today that insurance premiums for offshore drilling have soared between 15 and 50 percent now for companies like bp who are generally selfinsured with reinsurance and shell and chevron that are big enough to handle these increases and i think big enough to pay the billions of dollars of claims that potentially can come im not too concerned but i am concerned about actions that this congress would take that would make it virtually impossible or very difficult for other independents and small operators there are thousands that seem to be invisible to some members but theyre not invisible to me so i think weve got to be very careful about that i couldnt agree with you more the polluter should pay bp should bepay everything as ive said and if anyone else was at fault they should as well but mr bennettive got a minute lefti want to ask you this question i need to be very clear with you as we met in my office for some time and i appreciate you comingwhat does the law require you to do now to make bp pay these claims in full and on time do you have the authority to make them do that if not do you need some additional authority mr bennett the current law requires me to notify them that their obligation to advertise and to receive claims and to make sure theyre doing that theyre doing that beyond that what the law allowsthat if bp doeseither denies a claim or does not respond to a claimant within 90 days the claimant may bring their claim directly to me and then i can adjudicate it and if i chose to pay it i will pay bp the idea behind that is that small claimants especially dont have to go through costly litigation if they dont get the right answer from bp they can bring it to us as a second look if we pay it its npfc and justice talking to bp about senator landrieu thats goods to know that not everybody in louisiana is going to have hire an attorney some of them are and theyre going to want to and should but we dont want everybody having to hire attorneys and accountants and spend thousands of dollars to get a legitimate claim paid for the record mr presidentmr presidentmr chairman i want to saybecause transocean isnt here and i just learned this in a meeting with them but in fairness id like to say this on the record70 to 80 percent of their revenues come from outside of the united states so when someone asked why they may be headquartered outside of the united states its because 70 percent of their revenues come from outside of the united states ill get the accurate information now im not going to comment at all about their distribution et cetera but what people have to understand about this offshore oil and gas industry which im glad everybodys now paying a lot of attention is that a lot of these companies get a majority of their revenues from other places in the world not just in the gulf of mexico thank you the chairman senator cantwell senator cantwell thank you mr chairman i know were going toi think wereare you going to have a second panel at some point in time the chairman we do have a second panel right after your questions are finished senator cantwell ok i almost wish mr meltz could join us now from the crs ill wait butbecause mr perrellihis testimony seems to be a little different than yours on this issue of retroactivity the reason why im interested in this i think as like millions of americans we want to know who is going to clean this up and how were going to pay for it and to make sure that they taxpayer doesnt become the deep pocket on this and that we also dont wait 20 years as we did with the exxon valdez case but in his testimony on retroactivity he basically says the constitution disfavors retroactivity at least 5 constitutional provisions noted above basically make it very hard to go back and do retroactivity so you seem much more confident mr perrelli i read mr meltzs testimony and i actually think it is more consistent while he starts from the proposition and i quote that the constitution disfavors retroactivity as i indicated congress legislates retroactively all the time particularly in a context where theres an important public policy purpose at issue congress is legislating in a rational way to try to address the potential compensation and cleanup for victims in a statute that is not penal in any way and covers a broad range ofyou know whether its past and future activities i think we think we have strong arguments that if congress decided to legislate retroactively that it would be upheld as constitutional senator cantwell in the oil spill liability trust fund or someplace else mr perrelli im not sure iif senator cantwell how would you legislatethe discussions have been changing the oil spill liability trust fund and raisingtaking off the cap thinking about mr perrelli right removal of the cap senator cantwell continuing things of that nature to make it retroactive again im all for them paying what i dont want is to hear today oh theres this simple answer i dont want to hearjust like when they were here a few weeks ago and they were saying were going to pay all legitimate claims then i read a list and they start going oh well i dont know about that one or yes or no so i dont want to hear today oh we have great hope and promise in retroactivity only to find out it takes us 25 years to get anywhere on that case in the meantime theres significant damage thats not dealt with so he basically says that on these 5 different issues here that 3 of thembasically he say haveappear to have modest chance of success and 2 of them seem to have almost no chance of success those are those constitutional issues so youre thinking of something different mr perrelli senator i think that our view is that we would have a strong chance to defeat any constitutional claims if congress were to lift the caps so i may ballpark the chances a little bit differently but i think fundamentally as i indicated congress legislates retroactively quite frequently as so we dont think that that would be an issue as mr meltz noted and as i noted before i do think there certainly is the potential for a breach of contract action but opa itself expressly says and puts everyone on notice that congress has reserved the right to increase penalties or increase removal costs or damages and increase the liability or impose additional requirements so i think thats clear to everyone in the industry senator cantwell but it doesnt say retroactively mr perrelli it doesnt say retroactively but as i indicated we believe that we have strong arguments to defeat any retroactivity argument that would be made senator cantwell thank you for your clarity do you think that we should also look atyou know since bp has had something like 373 millions in fines and restitution for environmental violationsa texas refinery in an explosion in 2005 a leak from a crude oil pipe in alaska fraud for conspiring to corner the market and manipulation of propanedo you think that there should be some sort three strikes youre out kind of clause as it relates to companies doing business that maybe you wouldnt allow them to continue to bid on new leases mr hayes senator werewed be open to that certainly i mean there are other examples in other environmental laws of situations where companies arebecause of a pattern of behavior are for example not allowed to beto have federal contracts that sort of thing so we arewere absolutely open to that i think were very interested in seeing these investigations run to ground and not prematurely drawing conclusions but we do intend to look at those issues senator cantwell thank you mr chairman the chairman senator shaheen did you wish make another comment senator shaheen no i just would like to request that when mr hayes provides the bp responsibility document to senator menendez that you make it available to the entire committee thank you the chairman let me thank this panel very much for your testimony youve been very generous with your time we appreciate it let me call the second panel forward thats mr jonathan ramseur who is specialist in environmental policy with congressional research service mr rawle king who is an analyst in financial economics and risk assessment with congressional research service and mr robert meltz whos legislative attorney with the congressional research service i would just advise the witnesses that our republican colleagues arehave been invited to a lunch with the president beginning here at noon thats why they are not in attendance so that explains some of the absences let me ask each of you to take about 5 minutes and make the main points that you think we need to understand then of course we will include your full statements in the record mr ramseur go right ahead statement of jonathan ramseur specialist in environmental policy congressional research service mr ramseur good afternoon mr chairman ranking member and members of the committee my name is jonathan ramseur and i am a specialist in environmental policy in the congressional research service i have been asked by the committee to discuss aspects of the oil spill liability policy and allocation of costs associated with a major oil spill my testimony will provide background on the oil pollution acts liability structure and its interaction with the oil spill liability trust fund i should note that crs does not advocate policy or take a position on specific legislation opa liability provisions apply to any discharge of oil from a vessel or facility to navigable waters adjoining shorelines or the exclusive economic zone of the united states responsible parties include owners and operators of vessels or facilities or lessees of offshore facilities responsible parties are liable for oil spill removal costs natural resource damages and a range of economic costs however a partys liability may be limited liability limits differ by oil spill source for example tank vessel liability is generally based on a vessels gross tonnage offshore facilities like the gulf well leased to british petroleum have their liability caps at all removal costs plus 75 million under some circumstances a partys opa liability may be unlimited liability limits do not apply if an oil spill was proximately caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or the violation of an applicable federal safety construction or operating regulation in addition the responsible party must report the spill and cooperate with response officials it is currently undetermined whether liability limits would apply to the gulf oil spill regardless individual liability is only one component of the framework established by opa the second significant element is the oil spill liability trust fund primary purposes of the fund include immediate access to funds for prompt federal oil spill response and payment for claims in excess of a responsible partys liability cap the fund is supported by a perbarrel tax on domestic and imported oil at present the tax is 8 cents a recent estimate made before the gulf spillfrom ombindicated a fund balance of approximately 16 billion however the fund has a perincident expenditure cap of 1 billion when opa was drafted congress intended that this cap would be able to cover catastrophic spills the national pollution fund center which manages the fund would only be able to award claims up to this threshold it is my understanding that such a scenario has not occurred in the funds history costs beyond the opa trust funds perincident limit could be addressed in several ways existing federal authorities could be used to provide assistance in some circumstances another route of recourse would be the parties to state loss opa specifically does not preempt states from imposing additional liability or requirements relating to oil spills however it is uncertain how state laws would interact in this situation and compensation via state laws may involve considerable litigation these issues raise a central policy question how should congress allocate the costs associated with a major accidental oil spill congress may consider modifying opas liability and compensation framework potential options for congress include but are limited to increasing the liability limits so the responsible party would be required to pay a greater portion of the spill cost to increasing the perbarrel oil tax to more quickly raise the funds balance concurrently congress could remove or raise the perincident cap on the trust fund it might be noted that the 1billion cap established in 1990 is approximately equivalent to 600 million in todays dollars three authorizing repayable advances to be made via the appropriations process to the trust fund so that the fund would have resources to carry out its functions recent legislative proposals have included these approaches thank you again for the invitation to appear today i will be pleased to address any questions you may have the prepared statement of mr ramseur follows statement of jonathan ramseur specialist in environmental policy congressional research service good afternoon mr chairman ranking member and members of the committee my name is jonathan ramseur i am a specialist in environmental policy in the congressional research service crs on behalf of crs i would like to thank the committee for inviting me to testify here today i have been asked by the committee to discuss aspects of oil spill liability policy and allocation of costs associated with a major oil spill my testimony will provide background on the oil pollution acts liability structure and its interaction with the oil spill liability trust fund i should note that crs does not advocate policy or take a position on specific legislation oil spill liability before the 1989 exxon valdez spill when the exxon valdez ran aground in march 1989 multiple federal statutes state statutes and international conventions dealt with oil discharges many observers1 described this legal collection as an ineffective patchwork arguably each law had perceived shortcomings and none provided comprehensive oil spill coverage for more than 15 years prior to the valdez congress had made attempts to enact a unified oil pollution law several contentious issues hindered the passage of legislation a central point of debate dealt with state preemption whether a federal oil spill law should limit a states ability to impose stricter requirements particularly unlimited liability 1 see for example us congress house committee on merchant marine and fisheries report accompanying hr 1465 oil pollution prevention removal liability and compensation act of 1989 1989 hrept 101242 part 2 101st cong 1st sess p 32 in the aftermath of valdezwhich was followed by a handful of other large oil spills in 1989 and 1990members faced great pressure to overcome these disputed issues2 the spill highlighted the inadequacies of the existing coverage and generated public outrage the end result was the oil pollution act of 1990 opa3signed august 18 1990the first comprehensive law to specifically address oil pollution to waterways and coastlines of the united states 2

but also by a private party9 limits or caps to liability barring exceptions identified below responsible party liability is limited or capped for each incident10 the liability limits differ based on the source of the oil spill some limits are simple dollar amounts others have unlimited liability for cleanup costs with limits on other damages for example and relevant to the gulf spill 8 congress

reconciliation act of 1986 pl 99509 pursuant to executive order eo 12777 the us coast guard created the national pollution funds center npfc to manage the trust fund in 1991 the fund may be used for several purposes including prompt payment of costs for responding to and removing oil spills payment of the costs incurred by the federal and state trustees of natural resources for assessing the injuries to natural resources caused by an oil spill and developing and implementing the plans to restore or replace the injured natural resources and payment for the range of claims described above eg financial losses government revenue losses property damages etc projected level of the fund opa provided the statutory authorization necessary to put the fund in motion through opa congress transferred other federal liability funds21 into the osltf in complementary legislation congress imposed a 5centperbarrel tax on the oil industry to support the fund22 collection of this fee23 ceased on december 31 1994 due to a sunset provision in the law however in april 2006 the tax was reinstated by the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 in addition the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 pl 110343 increased the tax rate to 8 cents through 2016 in 2017 the rate increases to 9 cents the tax is scheduled to terminate at the end of 201724 21 the clean water act section 311k revolving

sources for the fund include interest on the fund cost recovery from the parties responsible for the spills and any fines or civil penalties collected 23 the tax is imposed on 1 crude oil received at us refineries paid by the operator of the refinery and 2 imported crude oil and petroleum products paid by the person entering the product for consumption use or warehousing see 26 usc 4611 24 section 405 of pl 110343 under the original tax legislation the omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1989 pl 101239 the perbarrel tax would be suspended in any calendar quarter if the fund balance reached 1 billion restarting again if it dipped below that number with the energy policy act of 2005 pl 10958 congress raised this threshold from 1 billion to 27 billion the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 repealed the requirement that the tax be suspended if the unobligated balance of the fund exceeded 27 billion as illustrated in figure 1 the fund was projected in may 2009 to reach approximately 35 billion in fy2016 earlier this year the office of management and budget omb estimated an unobligated balance of 1575 billion in the trust fund by the end of fy201025 figure has been retained in committee files 25 office of management and budget budget of the us government for fiscal year 2011 appendix p 548 trust fund vulnerability and liability limits considerations for congress a primary purpose of the trust fund is to reimburse persons for removal costs andor damages that exceed the responsible parties liability limits for example if a spillers liability limit is determined to be 100 million and the total costs of the incident equal 500 million the trust fund could reimburse parties for the difference in this case 400 million however opa established a per incident expenditure cap the maximum total amount available for each incident is 1 billion within this 1 billion limit natural resource damage awards can not exceed 500 million such a scenario has not occurred under the opa framework a significant spill particularly one that impacts sensitive environments andor areas of substantial human populations could threaten the viability of the fund as one reference point the exxon valdez spill tallied approximately 2 billion in cleanup costs and 1 billion in natural resource damages not including thirdparty claims in 1990 dollars punitive damage claims were litigated for more than 12 years eventually reaching the us supreme court in 2008 exxon shipping v baker plaintiffs were eventually awarded approximately 500 million in punitive damages26 an additional 500 million in interest on those damages was subsequently awarded 26 note that the original 1994 district court award was for 5 billion these issues raise a central policy question how should congress allocate the costs associated with a major accidental oil spill under the existing framework responsible parties ie ownersoperators of vessels and facilities are liable up to their liability caps if applicable the trust fund which is funded primarily through the tax on the oil industry covers costs above liability limits up to the per incident cap 1 billion statements from opas legislative history suggest that drafters intended the fund to cover catastrophic spills27 27 us congress house committee on merchant marine and fisheries report accompanying hr 1465 oil pollution prevention removal liability and compensation act of 1989 1989 hrept 101 242 part 2 101st cong 1st sess p 36 costs including for example natural resource damages economic losses etc28 beyond this perincident limit could be addressed in several ways one mechanism would be for parties to use state laws opa does not preempt states from imposing additional liability or requirements relating to oil spills or establishing analogous state oil spill funds 33 usc 2718 opa legislative history and statements from opa drafters29 indicate that state laws and funds would supplement if necessary the federal liability framework under opa alternatively existing federal authorities could be used to provide assistance in some circumstances for example an emergency declaration under the stafford act would appear a potential approach for the current situation because it is intended to lessen the impact of an imminent disaster a declaration in the context of a manmade disaster is unprecedented during the exxon valdez spill the president turned down the governor of alaskas two requests for an emergency declaration30 regardless other federal authorities may provide mechanisms for assistance31 28 although offshore facilities are liable for all removal costs liability for removal costs for other responsible party categories eg tank vessels onshore facilities is limited thus a significant oil spill from a tank vessel could potentially encounter the perincident trust fund cap based solely on its response costs 29 see george mitchell preservation of state and federal authority under the oil pollution act of 1990 environmental law vol 21 no 2 1991 30 the rationale for the turndowns was that a declaration by the president would hinder the governments litigation against exxon that promised substantial compensation for the incident see crs report r41234 potential stafford act declarations for the gulf coast oil spill issues for congress by francis x mccarthy 31 for example see the amendment in the nature of a substitute to hr 4899 supplemental appropriations act 2010 reported from the senate committee on appropriations may 14 2010 s rept 111188 in addition congress may consider modifying this liability framework potential options for congress include but are not limited to 1 increase the liability limits so that the responsible party would be required to pay a greater portion of the total spill cost before accessing trust fund dollars eg s 3305 introduced may 4 2010 by senator menendez 2 increase the perbarrel oil tax to more quickly raise the funds balance concurrently congress could remove or raise the perincident cap on the trust fund 3 authorize repayable advances to be made via the appropriations process to the trust fund so that the fund would have the resources to carry out its functions cleanup efforts claim awards up until 1995 the fund had this authority in order to ensure it could respond to a major spill before the fund had an opportunity to grow via the perbarrel tax s 3036 introduced may 4 2010 by senator menendez would take this approach this proposal would allow unlimited advances thank you again for invitation to appear today i will be pleased to address any questions you may have the chairman thank you very much mr king statement of rawle o king analyst in financial economics and risk assessment congressional research service mr king my name is rawle king im in analyst in financial economics and risk assessment at the congressional research service crs has been asked by the committee to provide testimony on financing recovery from largescale natural disasters and to review the amount of insurance that is likely to become available from the global commercial insurance market for thirdparty pollution liability damages facing operators of offshore energy facilities in the aftermath of the deepwater horizon accident in the aftermath of this event one major issue that congress may wish to deliberate upon is the willingness of the commercial insurance industry to participate in the oil spill financial requirement program given the proposed increase in the limit of liability required under opa to 10 billion and also the required evidence of financial responsibility to some level that is yet to be determined some insurance market experts have asserted that the potential capacity for thirdparty liability commercial insurance that is available to meet the oil spill financial requirements is approximately in the range of 15 billion this amount is likely to be far below the oil spill financial responsibility requirement for the proposed 10billion liability limit companies that engage in oil spill and gas exploration drilling and production face many risks in general the offshore energy business in the gulf of mexico involves risks that can be classified in 5 broad categories whether its weather perils marine perils drilling perils production perils politicalrisk perils the deepwater horizon incident appears to some to have resulted from the drilling peril a drilling peril involving a blowout preventer the insurance underwriting of offshore energy facilities is among the most difficult and complex commercial property and liability risk to insure especially in the gulf of mexico where hurricanes often damage platform and overseasundersea pipeline the offshore oil and gas insurance market a specialty insurance market with about 35 billion in annual premiums offers insurance coverage for blowoutcontrol of blowouts the cost of drilling in deep water and in the event of a blowout the cost of redrilling given the time that has been allotted to me i would like to delve quickly into the insurance requirements under section 1016 of opa parties responsible for the offshore facilities must establish and maintain financial responsibility capability to meet their liabilities for removal costs and damages caused by oil discharge from an offshore facility and associated pipelines this financial responsibility is demonstrated in various ways including surety bonds guarantees letters of credit and selfinsurance but the most common method by means to achieve this requirement is through insurance certificates the problem has been thatgoing forward is thatby the way the market thus far has been in the soft market so insurance was readily available the problem now is the limited capacity in the global commercial insurance market to meet the demands going forward this is the fundamental problem how will the offshore energy companies meet their insurance requirement going forward given the limited capacity that stands behind the insurance that is sold in the commercial marketplace so it becomes an availability issue to some extent it becomes an insurability issue given the strict liability provisions in the opa statute id like to deal with 2 distinct points in terms of the insurance availability issue some insurancejust based on economics of supply anddemand principles and the fallout from possibly the worst damaging oil spill in the nations history one would expect that the supply of insurance coverage for new financial responsibility requirements to only be available at a higher price weve heard today and quite naturally the cost of insurance has gone up dramatically given a limited supply of insurance increased demand for the coverage you would expect prices to go up it may go up and also the insurance may not be available at all so if the past is an indication of the future private commercial insurers concerned about the potential for future massive environmentalrelated damages may be reluctant to commit financial capital to underwrite unknown new risk in the postdeepwater horizon environment until theres greater clarity on the legislative and the legal climate insurers simply need to collect the necessary data for evaluation of this risk associated with the severity of the losses that are unknown at this time so in conclusion given the magnitude of losses and uncertainty about future profitability in the energy insurance business a hard insuranceenergy insurance market where theres scarcity of coverage and high prices may emerge following this incident many insurance market experts would support a more efficient i believeand basedthis is based on my research looking at the catastrophe risk and how to finance this risk given the limited capacity thats available currently in the energy insurance market that is a specialty market that generates roughly 35 billion in premium that is a small market relative to the whole global insurance marketplace most experts would believe that what is needed is a more efficient predisaster riskfinancing approach to managing and financing largescale oil spill disasters so what im saying is the current way of insuring the risk and transferring it to the reinsurance market its limited so the ability now to expand the liability coverage and expect the oil companies to go into the smallrelatively small insurance market the capacity is not there so whatand it may be out of theoutside of the jurisdiction of this committee how do you expand the market for this risk a prefinancing mechanism would involve alternative riskfinancing strategies that again is beyond this committee but that is how the catastrophe insurance market is moving to provide coverage through the insurance mechanism thank you again for this invitation to appear today i will be pleased to address any questions you may have the prepared statement of mr king follows statement of rawle o king analyst in financial economics and risk assessment congressional research service good afternoon chairman bingaman ranking member murkowski and members of the committee my name is rawle king i am an analyst in financial economics and risk assessment in the congressional research service crs on behalf of crs i would like to thank the committee for inviting me to testify here today crs has been asked by the committee to provide testimony on financing recovery from largescale disasters and to review the amount of insurance that is likely to become available from the commercial insurance market for thirdparty pollution liability damages facing operators of offshore energy facilities in the aftermath of the deepwater horizon accident i should note that crs does not advocate policy or take a position on specific legislation introduction companies that engage in oil and gas exploration drilling and production on federal lands on the outer continental shelf ocs face a wide range of risks including marine environmental uncertainty adverse exposures in drilling and construction of offshore oil wells performance of equipment and defects in plans and specifications numerous parties are involved in the us offshore oil and gas exploration and development business including lease or permit holders drilling contractors cementing engineers and their various subcontractors such as the manufacturers of the blowout preventer in the early 1960s a specialty energy insurance market emerged to offer pollution liability coverage for thirdparty property claims and cleanup and contamination risks oil well blowouts and redrilling in 1990 congress passed the oil pollution act opa1 to strengthen the safety and environmental practices in the oil and gas exploration drilling and production business under opa operators of offshore energy facilities must demonstrate oil spill financial responsibility osfr for removal costs and damages caused by oil discharges from offshore facilities and associated pipelines commercial insurance is usually purchased by the facility operator to not only meet the osfr requirements pertaining to pollution liability coverage for thirdparty property claims and cleanup and contamination risks but also to protect the company itself from the financial consequences of an oil well blowout and the expenditures following the loss of well control the cost to redrill after a blowout and the pollution liability coverage for thirdparty property claims and cleanup and contamination risks and the direct physical loss or damage to platforms rigs and equipment 1

the alpha well 21 but its impact may be unlike any other in terms of offshore oil pollution damages the final cost of the deepwater horizon incident will likely depend on many factors including the distance between the oil spill location and the potential impact sites along the gulf coast the sea conditions the sensitivity of affected locations to damage from oil and cleanup techniques the availability and cost of cleanup labor the ecosystem value attributed to the location and socioeconomic factors such as the economic value of activities affected by the spill and the acceptability of

upstream the transportation storage and trading of crude oil refined products and natural gas the midstream and refining and marketing of crude oil the downstream the us minerals management services mms uses auctions to allocate exploration and drilling rights leases for oil and gas on federal lands on the outer continental shelf ocs the federal offshore leasing program began in 1954 companies could individually or through a joint offer submit a bid on areas or tracts within the federal offshore lands that are available for drilling the winning bidder has the right but not the obligation to conduct exploratory drilling of the area there is a fixed lease term during which exploration must begin to avoid having the lease revert to the government leases are automatically renewed if it is productive provided the operator pays the appropriate royalty to the government the insurance underwriting of offshore oil and gas exploration drilling and production facilities is among the most difficult and complex commercial property and liability risk to insure especially in the gulf of mexico where hurricanes often damage platforms and undersea pipelines and drilling and construction projects are major undertakings that require the use of large and expensive marine vessels6 6 for more information see the international oil pollution compensation fund located at httpwwwiopcfundorg the offshore energy business in the gulf of mexico involves risks that could be classified in five broad categories weather perils that include environmental factors such as storms wind hurricanes lightning and icesnowfreezing marine perils that include fatigue and corrosion arising from environmental conditions collision with attendant or passing vessels foundation failure subsidence and mudslides drilling perils that include surface and subsurface blowouts production perils that include fire explosion and equipment failure but also construction defects and maintenance and

offshore drilling units modus and fixed units modus are classified in terms of bottomsupported shallow water rigs and floating deepwater rigs in bottomsupported units the rig is in contact with the sea floor during drilling while a floating rig floats over the site while it drills held in position by anchors or equipped with thrusters to be dynamically positioned both units float when moved from one site to another bottomsupported units include jack ups tenders submersibles and barges floating units include semi submersibles and drillships fixed units or platform rigs are drilling units that are placed upon a platform or other structures subsea floating production systems are employed in deeper water the deepwater horizon was a floating production system fps or vessel that was connected to a subsea pipeline while a floating production storage and offloading vessel fpso processed and stored oil on board a vessel prior to being offloaded into shuttle tankers operators extra expense control of wellthe operators extra expense oee insurance covers the costs of regaining control of an oil well after an underground blowout oee covers evacuation expenses and the property of others in the insureds care custody and control in addition coverage may include the redrilling of a well after a blowout to the original depth and comparable condition prior to the loss as well as the legal expenses emanating from an incident such as the sinking of a rig or an oil spill with respect to sudden and accidental pollution the offshore facility operator is also indemnified for thirdparty bodily injury claims damage to and loss of third party property and the cost of clean up and defense expenses as a result of a blowout excess liability insurance coverageexcess liability insurance covers all legal liabilities that an offshore energy facility operator might encounter it is purchased as an additional layer of coverage in excess of the oee policy business interruptioncovers damage to platforms pipelines tankers etc owned by the insured and contingent business interruption associated with damage to upstream facilities such as processing plants trunklines and refineries owned by third parties this coverage is usually written in conjunction with offshore physical damage coverage on standardized forms published by insurance services office iso or those that resemble the iso form10 because of the standardization in contract language there tends to be more predictability in claim payments and therefore reduced potential litigation over contract interpretation companies filing a business interruption insurance claim must show that their business operation sustained actual direct physical loss of or damage to the insured property without this proof the business interruption claim could be denied this in turn could result in extensive litigation because as many experts agree the consequences of an oil spill can be far reaching without any need for the oil itself to actually reach those affected 10 iso form cp 0030 workers compensationemployers liabilityprovides coverage for claims arising out of employee injuries oil spill financial responsibility for offshore facilities as a matter of us environmental policy congress has enacted numerous environmental laws designed to control oil pollution in the us waters policy is implemented by federal agencies through regulations rules administrative orders memoranda and programs11 acts of oil pollution are regulated controlled by a wide range of enforcement methods undertaken by the us environmental protection agency epa as well as the us coast guard that protects and enforces regulations pertaining to us waters in addition many federal environmental regulations standards are delegated to the states for their implementation 11 some of the other water programs that are not addressed in this report include the regulation of the containment of wastes covered by the solid waster disposal and cercla act the federal land policy and management act the surface mining control and reclamation act the forest and rangeland renewable resources planning act the coastal zone management act or the marine mammal protection act the oil pollution act of 1990 opa features a financial responsibility requirement and compulsory liability insurance combined with strict liability rules that strive to accomplish several things prevent oil pollution damages from offshore energy facilities12 12 it is important to distinguish between a mobile offshore drilling unit modu such as the deepwater horizon and a well drilled from a modu a mobile offshore drilling unit modu is classified as a vessel and well drilling from a modu is classified as a covered offshore facility cof under the opa the secretary of transportation has authority for vessel oil pollution financial responsibility and the us coast guard regulates the oilspill financial responsibility program for vessels establish oil spill financial responsibility osfr for lease holders of offshore facilities to demonstrate the capability to meet liability for possible removal costs and damages establish a standard for measuring natural resource damages worst case oil spill for an offshore energy facility establish penalties for not complying with the act specifically the opa features a compulsory liability insurance structure as part of the oil spill financial responsibility osfr requirement combined with strict liability rules for oil pollution damages associated with offshore energy facilities the financial responsibility and compulsory insurance requirements provide the funds to pay for damages and the strict liability rules allow thirdparty claims to be made directly against the insurer irrespective of negligence this regulatory structure serves to avoid timeconsuming and costly litigation and the need for oil spill victims to prove negligence as the primary test of liability for oil pollution damage the rational basis for the compulsory insurancestrict liability structure is threefold 1 the loss however caused is more than the victim can be expected to bear without hardship 2 the compensatory system is not a liability system as such but instead a means to speedily compensate oil pollution victims and 3 the regulatory scheme needs resources from which to pay unlimited compensation insurance requirements under section 1016 of the opa parties responsible for offshore facilities must establish and maintain oil spill financial responsibility osfr capability to meet their liabilities for removal costs and damages caused by oil discharges from an offshore facility and associated pipelines the osfr is demonstrated in various ways including surety bonds guarantees letters of credit and self insurance but the most common method is by means of an insurance certificate the insurance certificate spells out the limit required under section 1016 of opa lease holders of a covered offshore facility cof must demonstrate a minimum amount of osfr of 35 million per 35000 barrels of worst case oilspill discharge up to a maximum of 150 for cof located in the ocs and 10 million in state waters as an illustration a worst case oilspill discharge volume of 35000 barrels bbls requires 35 million in osfr while a volume of 35001 bbls requires 70 million the mms calculates the worst case oilspill discharge volume for a facility an exemption to the osfr is provided for persons responsible for facilities having a potential worst case oilspill discharge of 1000 bbls or less policy issues and analysis in the aftermath of the deepwater horizon incident one major issue that congress may wish to deliberate is the willingness of the commercial energy insurance industry to participate in the osfr program given the proposed increase in the limit of liability required under opa to 10 billion and also the required evidence of osfr to some level that is yet to be determined if insurers were willing to participate another question is whether the new limit of liability is supported by the availability of insurance coverage on adequate terms and conditions in the global commercial insurance market for offshore energy facilities given the insurability of future offshore oil spill hazards and the insurance markets capacity for underwriting catastrophe or peak risks including oil spill damages future insurability of offshore oil spill perils with respect to the insurability of future oil spill hazards it is beneficial to point out that in recent decades the frequency and magnitude of largescale natural disasters have been increasing along with federal spending to mitigate future losses and compensate disaster victims as a major source of postdisaster recovery financing commercial insurance companies have also been called upon to pay for catastropherelated losses in some cases beyond their contractual policy limitations for example after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks at the world trade center insurers faced pressure to interpret policy language liberally with respect to war risk coverage and the number of occurrences after some negotiation between private insurers and reinsurers legislators and other industry participants which led to the passage of the terrorism risk insurance act a predisaster risk financing scheme insurers agreed to pay claims related to the 9 11 incident insurers did not charge a premium to cover the risk other notable examples include asbestos and superfund environmental claims continuum triggers and hurricane katrina with the water exclusion provision in homeowners insurance policies where some policies were reinterpreted by the courts to expand coverage for water damage where coverage was explicitly excluded consideration of coverage expansion through the reinterpretation of insurance contract language by the courts could affect the availability of insurance for offshore energy facilities going forward available liability insurance capacity the proposed increase in the limit of liability required under opa to 10 billion and also the required evidence of osfr to something similar could have at least three consequences in the energy insurance market first some insurance market experts have asserted that the global commercial insurance capacity for third party liability insuranceoperators extra expense oee and excess liabilities coveragethat is available to meet osfr requirements is approximately in the range of 15 billion insurers make the point that the strict liability with direct access to the insurer serves to further limit overall industry capacity the reason is that the insurer can not control claims payment with contract terms and conditions the point is that the estimated 15 billion is likely to be far below the osfr for the new 10 billion liability limits moreover the oee coverage provides a combined single limit for well control well redrilling after the blowout and sudden and accidental seepage and pollution cleanup thus pollution liability and cleanup is subject to the apportionment of the combined single limit over respective risks what this means is that operators of cof would have to prioritize the single limit use the insurance proceeds to first hire a well control expert to retake control of the well and if necessary drill a new well with the balance of the oee insurance limits used for pollution cleanup second given basic economic supplydemand principles and the fallout from possibly the most damaging oil spill in the nations history one would expect the supply of insurance coverage for the new osfr to only be available at a high price or premium if at all the imposition of higher strict liability limits for largescale oil pollution could have the effect of greatly increasing the demand for liability insurance protection this could multiply the challenges insurers would have in evaluating the risk exposure defining reasonable limits for the coverage and calculating prices this means the operators may find themselves assuming or retaining higher levels of self insurance which might affect the mmss offshore oil and gas lease bidding and ultimately the royalties earned for the us treasury the availability of alternative sources of capital for spreading financial risk perhaps through catastrophe bonds or energy insurance financial futures and options ie derivative financial instruments that securitizes insurance risk turning an insurance policy or reinsurance contract into a security could provide the added capital needed in the insurance industry to cover the higher liability and associated osfr limits third if the past is an indication of the future private commercial insurers may be reluctant to commit financial capital in underwriting unknown new risks in the postdeepwater horizon environment until there is greater clarity on the legislative and legal climate insurers would need to collect the necessary data for evaluation of risks associated with certain severity of loss and insurability calculate rate policy terms and conditions and set appropriate limitations conduct of these normal activities at least in the short term will be affected by the uncertainty of the losses associated with the recent gulf of mexico oil spill from an insurers perspective one issue that may arise is the potential for future massive environmentalrelated strict liability damages which leads to the question as to whether offshore oil pollution will be insurable or insurable only with government support given the magnitude of losses and uncertainty about future profitability in the energy insurance business a hard energy insurance market scarcity of coverage and high pricesmay emerge following the deepwater horizon incident prior to this event the third party pollution liability market was thought to be in a soft phase where rates were low as a result of oversupply of capacity13 13 willis limited energy market review on the edge of an abyss march 2010 located at httpwwwwilliscommediaroom pressreleasesbrowseall2010 20100324willisenergymarketreview24march2010 finally many insurance market experts would support a more efficient predisaster risk financing approach to managing and financing largescale oil spill disasters the opas oil financial responsibility rule is a predisaster risk financing strategy that in the wake of the deepwater horizon incident could come under intense pressure because of capital shortages in the insurance industry again new insurance and reinsurance companies additional capacity would be needed a number of approaches could emerge to enhance access to the capital markets through new innovative financial instruments that serve as alternatives to traditional reinsurance treaties grouped under the term alternative risk transfer or non traditional reinsurance thank you again for invitation to appear today i will be pleased to address any questions you may have the chairman thank you very much mr meltz statement of robert meltz legislative attorney congressional research service mr meltz thank you mr chairman and members of the committee crs is pleased to assist the committee today with its deliberations on the gulf oil spill ill just proceed to the constitutionality of s 3305 and 3346 and try to keep the nonlawyers from glazing over i do want to say that my estimation of the constitutionality question is pretty close to that of the justice departments although i dont know in detail what their arguments are s 3305 would raise from 75 million to 10 billion in the versionlast version i saw the liability limit in opa for damages caused by oil spills from offshore facilities assuming no exceptions are triggeredin which case the liability caps dont apply the bill sets an effective date of april 15 2010 presumably to cover the gulf spill this retroactivity has generated a constitutionality debate it is true that the constitution disfavors retroactivity no less than 5 constitutional provisions which ill get to embody the notion that people should be able to know the law and to conform their actions accordingly nonetheless each of these 5 provisions has its special purposes and its bounds recognizing that the retroactive application of statutes can be a desirable and unavoidable means of achieving a legitimate public purpose crs analysis indicates that challenges to s 3305s retroactivity based on 3 of the 5 retroactivityoriented provisions in the constitutionthe takings clause substantive due process and the bill of attainder clausehave at best a modest chance of success claims based on the other 2the impairment of contracts clause and ex post factohave we believe almost no chance of success but the legislative history of the bill yet to be generated may affect the analysis looking at the 3 provisions with at least a minimal chance of success the taking claim might becould be based on various things but likely it would be based on the extra money that a responsible party in the gulf would have to pay out under a retroactively raised liability cap itsbut as is often said by the supreme court those who do business in a heavily regulated field can not claim surprise when the legislative body fortifies the regulatory scheme most problematic for a taking claim is thatwhat the courts call generalized monetary liability can not be the basis of a taking claim opa liability for damages is generalized monetary liability second substantive due process as applied to economic legislation like s 3305 imposes only a minimum rationalbasis test making s 3305 retroactive seems rational enough without bringing in the gulf spill the bills increased liability would forego perhaps the most important application of that increased liability in a long time third to violate the bill of attainder clause a law must be punitive meaning that the law is not rationally describable as furthering a nonpunitive purpose but congress might easily assert a nonpunitive purpose for s 3305 say more fairly distributing the costs imposed by an oil spill between spiller and injured persons statements of those members of congress who support the bill may be reviewed carefully by a court in this regard for their intent the other 2 constitutional provisions need not detain us the impairment of contracts clause doesnt apply to the federal government the ex post facto clause only applies to criminal punishment all in all crs believes that making certain assumptions as to s 3305s legislative history it is likely to survive constitutional challenge thus bp may choose as associate attorney general perrelli said to litigate s 3305 under a breach of contract theory based on the lease terms s 3346 increases both the civil and criminal penalty caps in the outer continental shelf lands act butand like s 3305 the bill sets a preenactment effective date of april 15 for the increase in the civil penalty cap crs is unable to see any significant reason why the constitutionality analysis of this retroactivity should be any different than for s 3305 nor the result any different as for the increase by s 3346 in the outer continental shelf lands act criminal penalty cap the bill states no effective cap i understand there may have been an earlier version of the bill which stated a preenactment effective date but the current version i understand states no effective date for the criminalincrease in the criminal penalty cap hence a court would almost certainly assume that the effective date is the date of enactment a dateof enactment effective date also avoids any ex post facto infirmity thank you very much and ill be glad to take questions the prepared statement of mr meltz follows statement of robert meltz legislative attorney congressional research service mr chairman and members of the committee the congressional research service is pleased to assist the committee with its deliberations as to the appropriate congressional response to the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico i am an attorney with the american law division of crs where i specialize in environmental and fifth amendment takings law this statement 1 gives a brief overview of the liability scheme in the oil pollution act of 1990 opa 2 discusses the constitutionality of s 3305 which would retroactively raise the opa liability cap for damages caused by oil spills from offshore facilities and 3 discusses the constitutionality of s 3346 which would raise the civil penalty cap under the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla retroactively and raise the criminal penalty cap therein apparently as of bill enactment brief overview of opa liability opa title i serves to consolidate existing federal laws governing oil spill liability expand their coverage increase liability strengthen federal response authority and establish a fund to ensure that claims are paid up to a stated amount 33 usc sec sec 2701 2720 in its central provision title i states that each responsible party for a vessel or facility from which oil is discharged into or upon us navigable waters adjoining shorelines or the exclusive economic zone is liable for the resulting removal costs and damages opa sec 1002a removal costs are covered regardless of whether incurred by the united states a state an indian tribe or a private person opa sec 1002b1 damages include those for natural resource injury recoverable only by governments real or personal property injury and resulting economic losses recoverable only by the owner or lessee thereof loss of subsistence use governmental loss of revenues as from net loss of taxes and royalties loss of profits or impairment of earnings capacity recoverable by any claimant not just those who own oilcontaminated property and the net costs of providing increased or additional public services during or after removal activities opa sec 1002b2 the opa liability scheme is a stringent one modeled as it is after clean water act section 311 and comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act superfund act section 107 as with those statutes opa liability is strict and joint and several opa sec 100117 incorporating the clean water act liability standard and is subject to but a handful of defenses opa sec 1003ac on the other hand softening the liability scheme the act preserves the clean water act liability caps in most cases though raising them and has been held to preclude punitive damages imposed under federal law opa sec 1004a south port marine llc v gulf oil limited partnership 234 f3d 58 1st cir 2000 of special interest in connection with the recent gulf spill the responsible party at an offshore facility such as the british petroleum wellhead is subject to unlimited liability for removal costs but is granted a cap of 75 million on 2 the abovelisted categories of damages opa sec 1004a3 this cap has remained unchanged since opas enactment twenty years ago two other things should be said about this 75 million cap and others in opa first it applies per incident and per responsible party it is not certain at this point that the deepwater horizon spill involves only one responsible party and only one incident so there is a possibility the 75 million will be multiplied second the liability cap and others in opa is easily eliminated if any of five exceptions apply the cap is forfeited and liability for damages is without limit this would be the case for example if the gulf spill was found to be proximately caused by a responsible partys violation of an applicable federal safety construction or operating regulation opa sec 1004c1b because oil from the gulf spill may result in removal costs and damages in foreign nations it should be mentioned as well that opa contains many provisions providing for foreign claimants for example opa allows claims against responsible parties by foreign governments for natural resource damages at least where the secretary of state has certified that the foreign government provides a comparable remedy for us claimants opa sec sec 1006a4 1007a1b finally opa liabilities for removal costs and damages should be kept in context as they do not exhaust the potential liabilities of parties connected to the deepwater horizon spill for example clean water act section 311 33 usc sec 1251 imposes civil and criminal penalties for oil spills and the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla 43 usc sec 1350bc contains civil and criminal penalties for among other things violation of ocs lease terms or the act and its regulations in addition the ocsla extends the laws of the united states and the law of the adjacent state where not inconsistent with federal law to the ocs 43 usc sec 1333a thus for example there could conceivably be civil or criminal violations of the endangered species act marine mammal protection act or migratory bird treaty act in connection with the gulf spill the solid waste disposal act 42 usc sec 6901 et seq also may apply see opa sec 1018a2 finally opa specifies that state law imposing any additional liability or requirements with respect to the discharge of oil or other pollution by oil within such state is not preempted opa sec 1018a1 see also sec 1018c constitutionality of s 3305s retroactive increase in the offshore facility liability cap for damages s 3305 titled the big oil bailout prevention liability act of 2010 would raise the liability limit in opa section 1004a3 for damages caused by oil spills from offshore facilities it does so by simply striking the 75 million figure in that provision and replacing it with 10 billion thus preserving the exceptions that if applicable eliminate the cap more to the point s 3305 states that it would take effect april 15 2010 so it is plainly retroactive it may be noted however that even in the absence of a preenactment effective date s 3305 could be said to have some degree of retroactivity even if a responsible partys payments over the current 75 million cap all go toward damages occurring after the bill is enacted those damages stem from a preenactment incident and thus satisfy a common definition of retroactivity and even were it limited to postenactment spills s 3305 could be said to be retroactive in some measure if those spills occur at locations under preenactment leases the retroactive nature of the cap increase invites examination of five constitutional provisions as discussed below claims based on three of thesethe takings clause substantive due process and bill of attainder clauseappear to have at best a modest chance of success while claims under two othersthe impairment of contracts clause and ex post facto clauseseem to have almost no chance of success it must be stressed however that how the legislative history of an enacted law characterizes the predecessor billespecially whether a broad and legitimate public purpose for the bill is convincingly set forthmay affect the analysis especially with regard to the bill of attainder clause that legislative history of course does not yet exist further prediction of how courts will rule when applying the broadly worded tests of constitutional law is always uncertain finally based on the limited prospects of constitutional claims the retroactive increase is more likely to be litigated if at all as a possible breach of british petroleums lease contract an issue this testimony does not reach introductionthe constitution disfavors retroactivity at least five constitutional provisions noted above embody the notion that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly settled expectations should not lightly be disrupted landgraf v usi film products 511 us 244 265 1994 nonetheless each of these five provisions has its special concerns and is of limited scope id at 267 recognizing that within reasonable bounds the retroactive application of statutes can be an acceptable and unavoidable means of achieving a legitimate public purpose as the supreme court has said retroactivity provisions often serve entirely benign and legitimate purposes whether to respond to emergencies to correct mistakes to prevent circumvention of a new statute in the interval immediately preceding its passage or simply to give comprehensive effect to a new law congress considers salutary id at 267268 emphases added accordingly several supreme court decisions in the past halfcentury to address retroactive federal statutes have found them constitutionally inoffensive 1 takings clausea taking claim to succeed requires that the interest alleged to be taken is recognized as property by the takings clause moreover how the analysis proceeds may depend on the type of property based on a limited understanding of the facts surrounding the deepwater horizon situation crs supposes that at least three interests may be implicated first there is an interest in the law remaining unchanged in the substantive due process context this interest has long been held not to constitute a vested property interest no person has a vested interest in any rule of law entitling him to insist that it shall remain unchanged for his benefit new york central rr co v white 243 us 188 198 1917 more recently takings decisions have adopted the same proposition see eg branch v united states 69 f3d 1571 15771578 fed cir 1995 thus the bare fact that s 3305 would change the law existing when an offshore lease was entered into is not of itself a basis for a taking claim second opa responsible parties have an interest in any money paid for damages in excess of the current opa liability cap money is held to be property under the takings clause philips v washington legal found 524 us 156 1998 thus an opa responsible party would be able to argue under the canonical penn central test for regulatory takings 438 us 104 124 1978 that s 3305 effects a taking of its disbursements to cover damages beyond the existing liability cap under the penn central test used by the supreme court for takings challenges to retroactive monetary liability a court must examine 1 the economic impact of the government action 2 the degree to which it interferes with reasonable distinct investmentbacked expectations and 3 the character of the government action each of these penn central factors may pose an obstacle for a taking claim based on the retroactively increased monetary liability in s 3305 as for the economic impact factor the penn central test requires that the impact be very substantial if not severe before this factor weighs in favor of a taking in one case the supreme court held that a retroactively imposed monetary liability amounting to 46 of shareholder equity combined with the proportionality of that impact with plaintiffs conduct was insufficient to count the economic impact factor as favoring a taking concrete pipe products inc v construction laborers pension trust 508 us 602 645 1993 thus based on reports as to the net worth or market capitalization of british petroleum the potential additional liability under s 3305 that is the difference between 75 million and 10 billionis likely to fall short of the penn central threshold though it may not fall short as to other smaller responsible parties in this or future oil spills from offshore facilities the interference with reasonable investmentbacked expectations factor often involves courts in a review of the legal landscape at the time the property interest alleged to be taken was acquired with a view toward gauging the reasonableness of the buyers expectations of economically exploiting that property interest oil and gas operations on the outer continental shelf have been heavily regulated under ocsla since the 1950s moreover by 2008 when british petroleum entered into the lease at issue here federal oil spill liability limits had been increased some twice and some by multiples approaching the 133fold increase from 75 million to 10 billion s 3305 would effect as the supreme court said in addressing a taking challenge to retroactive monetary liability those who do business in the regulated field can not object if the regulatory scheme is buttressed by subsequent amendments to achieve the legislative end concrete pipe 508 us at 645 quoting fha v the darlington inc 358 us 84 91 1958 the court noted further because legislation readjusting rights and burdens is not unlawful solely because it upsets otherwise settled expectations even though the effect of the legislation is to impose a new duty or liability based on past acts concrete pipes reliance on the statute in questions original limitation of contingent liability to 30 of net worth is misplaced there being no reasonable basis to expect that the legislative ceiling would never be lifted 508 us at 646 emphasis added footnotes and quotation marks deleted thus a company entering into an ocs lease in recent decades faces an uphill climb in arguing that s 3305s increase in the liability cap interferes with its reasonable expectations as much a barrier as the first two penn central factors may be to a taking challenge to s 3305 it is the third factor the character of the government action that most likely will prove fatal broadly speaking courts are less inclined to find a taking when the challenged government conduct merely adjusts the benefits and burdens of economic life as does s 3305 than when it physically invades property more pointedly here courts have adopted the generalized monetary liability principle which demands that to be a taking the government conduct must target specific property the principle was first put forward by the concurring justice and four dissenters in eastern enterprises v apfel 524 us 498 1998that is by a majority of the supreme court thus a taking claim may arise when government appropriates money from a specifically identified fund of money such as interest on an interpleader fund but a statute imposing a generalized monetary liabilityeg that a pay b out of unspecified fundsis not a taking all lower courts that have addressed this point since eastern enterprises have endorsed the generalized monetary liability rule commonwealth edison co v united states 271 f3d 1327 133840 fed cir 2001 en banc swisher international inc v schafer 550 f3d 1046 11th cir 2008 cert denied 130 s ct 71 2009 empress casino joliet corp v giannoulias 896 ne2d 277 ill 2008 cert denied 129 s ct 2764 2009 in light of the principle it is unlikely that s 3305s increase in the opa liability cap for offshore facilitiesan increase in generalized monetary liabilitywould be regarded as a taking eastern enterprises should be factually distinguished however there a fourjustice plurality of the supreme court did indeed hold a federal statutes retroactivity to effect a taking explaining that the statute imposed severe retroactive liability attaching new liabilities to events that occurred decades earlier on a limited class of parties that could not have anticipated the liability and that the extent of liability was substantially disproportionate to the companys experience in the affected field these factual elements found by the plurality to be constitutionally offensive at least in the aggregate seem a far cry from the retroactivity of s 3305 as applied to the deepwater horizon spill s 3305 needs to reach back only a short time to april 20 2010 moreover an increase in the liability limit could have been anticipated given congress already noted history of liability cap increases in the oil spill area finally the extent of liability imposed by s 3305 is proportionate to the companys experience since the added liability would be only for damages stemming from a companys own oil spills of course the precedent value of eastern enterprises is further undercut by the fact that only a minority of the justices supported the takings analysis of the statutes retroactivity note that both before and after eastern enterprises every court to address the matter has rejected takings and substantive due process challenges to the superfund act whose heightening of preexisting liability standards extending to preenactment releases of hazardous substances offers some parallel to that of s 3305 see eg united states v alcan aluminum corp 315 f3d 179 189190 2d cir 2003 collecting cases as a third interest that could be asserted in a taking claim british petroleum might allege a right under its ocs lease not to be subject to laws enacted after the lease was signed leases are in the nature of contracts and contract rights generally are held to be property under the takings clause see eg lynch v united states 292 us 571 579 1934 that being so british petroleum might argue that s 3305 is essentially an abrogationa takingby congress of a contractlease term to which the united states had agreed such an argument would focus on the clause in the companys lease stating that the lease is issued subject to the outer continental shelf lands act existing regulations thereunder and certain future regulations thereunder and all other applicable statutes and regulations the company might contend that all other applicable statutes refers solely to statutes existing when the company entered into its lease not those such as s 3305 enacted later on there is solid supreme court support for this interpretation in 2000 the court interpreted the same catchall language in another outer continental shelf lease to include only statutes and regulations already existing at the time of the contract mobil oil exploration producing southeast inc v united states 530 us 604 616 2000 the argument would conclude that all other applicable statutes embraces the current 75 million cap in opa which s 3305 abrogates important here however is the consistent preference of the us court of federal claims and its appellate court the federal circuit for addressing disputes revolving around written contracts with the united states under a breach of contract rather than a takings theory see eg hughes communications galaxy inc v united states 271 f3d 1060 1070 fed cir 2001 takings claims rarely arise under government contracts because the government acts in its commercial or proprietary capacity castle v united states 301 f3d 1328 1342 fed cir 2002 nothing is taken in the constitutional sense when the plaintiff as is typical retains the full range of breach of contract remedies at least two challenges to congressional enactments as anticipatory breaches of preenactment ocsla leases are in the reported case law mobil oil supra amber resources co v united states 538 f3d 1358 fed cir 2008 as noted at the outset this testimony does not reach any breach of contract issues raised by s 3305 2 substantive due processthe due process clause of the fifth amendment has long been read to demand not only procedural due process but substantive due process as well substantive due process in the realm of economic legislation the realm of s 3305imposes only a very lax highly deferential standard that there exists a plausible rational basis which the legislative body could have had in mind linking the means chosen and the legitimate public purpose sought to be achieved in a leading retroactivitysubstantive due process decision the court explained to be sure insofar as the act being challenged requires compensation for disabilities bred during employment terminated before the date of enactment the act has some retrospective effect but our cases are clear that legislation readjusting rights and burdens is not unlawful solely because it upsets otherwise settled expectations this is true even though the effect of the legislation is to impose a new duty or liability based on past acts usery v turner elkhorn mining co 428 us 1 1516 1976 emphasis added the court did caution that the retrospective aspects of legislation as well as the prospective aspects must meet the test of due process and the justifications for the latter may not suffice for the former id at 17 but that burden said the court in a later decision is met simply by showing that the retroactive application of the legislation is itself justified by a rational legislative purpose pension benefit guaranty corp v ra gray co 467 us 717 730 1984 it would seem that the retroactive application of the increased liability limit in s 3305 back to the april 20 spill satisfies this test congress reasonably could suppose that for the foreseeable future most of the exceedance of the current opa liability cap would derive from this one huge spill to exclude that spill from the bills cap increase would compromise substantially the assumed public purpose of s 3305 to lay a greater portion of economic damages per oil spill at the feet of the responsible party similarly not applying s 3305 to other existing leases that is confining it to leases entered into postenactment would greatly undercut the effectuation of that public purpose as noted in the takings discussion above all substantive due process challenges to the retroactive liability scheme in the superfund act have been unsuccessful in sum the sounder argument is that the retroactive application of the 10 billion liability cap in s 3305 does not offend substantive due process 3 bill of attainder clausethe constitutions bill of attainder clause bars enactments that effectively declare the guilt of and impose punishment on an identifiable individual or entity without a judicial trial see nixon v administrator of general services 433 us 425 468 1977 such enactments are seen to usurp the judicial function thereby offending separation of powers and due process as pertinent here the argument might be that s 3305 by reaching back to april 15 2010 departs from the usual prospectiveonly application of enactments solely to bring in one particular oil spill the deepwater horizon incident this narrowfocus retroactivity the argument might conclude betrays an underlying intent to punish parties responsible for that incident then too the punishments that may be found constitutionally offensive are not limited solely to retribution for past events but may involve deprivations inflicted to deter future misconduct selective service system v minnesota public interest research group 468 us 841 851852 1984 thus one can imagine an argument that s 3305 would punish existing offshore facilities generally in nixon the court indicated that to offend the bill of attainder clause the law must 1 single out a specific person or class and 2 be punitive the court then listed several indicators that a federal law is punitive the law may impose punishment traditionally judged to be prohibited by the clause the law may not be rationally describable as furthering a nonpunitive legislative purpose and the legislative history may evince a congressional intent to punish a statute need not satisfy all these factors rather a court weighs them together arguably s 3305 would meet the first specificity requirement one indication the identity of the individual entity british petroleum or class responsible parties for offshore facilities generally was easily ascertainable when the legislation was passed we need not dwell on the specificity requirement however because it is likelyassuming congress does not evince a congressional intent to punish in passing s 3305that a court would find the bill not to satisfy the second punitive requirement first monetary liability for the injuries one causes is not a type of punishment historically prohibited by the bill of attainder clause second s 3305 can reasonably be said to further a nonpunitive legislative purpose attaching liability to the entity that caused the oil spill injury in lieu of the taxpayer in language plainly relevant to the deepwater horizon spill a court has noted even if the law in question singles out an individual on the basis of irreversible past conduct if it furthers a nonpunitive legislative purpose it is not a bill of attainder seariver maritime financial holdings inc v mineta 309 f3d 662 674 9th cir 2002 thus as long as the committee reports and floor debates on s 3305 do not suggest punitive motive the bill is unlikely to be deemed a bill of attainder it would seem as suggested above that there are obvious candidates for nonpunitive purposes that congress might put forward in the legislative history of s 3305 4 impairment of contracts clausethe supreme court has held that the impairment of contracts clause in the constitution by its terms applicable only to the states does not apply to the federal government indirectly through the fifth amendment due process clause pension benefit guaranty corp 467 us at 733 therefore this clause is no impediment to s 3305 5 ex post facto clausethis clause prohibits congress from passing laws attaching new negative legal consequences to pre enactment conduct since the early years of the nation the supreme court has construed the clause to apply only to penal legislation landgraf v usi film products 511 us 244 266 n19 1994 citing calder v bull 3 dall 386 390391 1798 by contrast the opa liability to which the 75 million cap and s 3305 apply is civil not criminal liability thus the ex post facto clause poses no obstacle to s 3305 constitutionality of s 3346s retroactive increase in ocslas civil penalty cap and increase in ocslas criminal penalty cap while s 3305 addresses compensatory liability s 3346 deals with penalties s 3346 titled the outer continental shelf lands act amendments act of 2010 would increase both the civil and criminal penalty caps under the ocsla 43 usc sec sec 1350b civil 1350c criminal under the bill a person including corporations not complying with among other things any ocsla lease term or regulation would after the allowed period for corrective action be liable for a civil penalty up to 75000 per day rather than the current 20000 per day noncompliance posing a serious threat of harm must result in a civil penalty up to 150000 for each day of violation without regard to the corrective period rather than the current discretionary civil penalty which appears to adopt the 20000 per day cap these civilpenalty amendments take effect preenactment s 3346 specifies on april 15 2010 just as s 3305 would finally under the bill a person who knowingly and willfully commits an act falling into any of four categories must upon conviction be punished by a criminal fine of not more than 10 million rather than the current 100000 the bill states no effective date for this criminalpenalty amendment as for the increase in ocslas civil penalty caps effective april 15 it would seem that the constitutionality analysis of retroactivity generally tracks that above for a retroactive increase in opas compensatory liability capsand with the same caveats that is a taking claim is still likely to founder because there is no property right to have the law remain unchanged because the additional money paid in fines is a generalized monetary liability not recognized under emerging case law as a basis for takings claims and because any lease contract right to be immune from civil penalties above the statutory cap in effect when the lease was entered into more likely would base a possible breach of contract than a possible taking as for the increased criminal penalty cap the ex post facto clause calls for added analysis because s 3346 states no effective date for its increase in this cap the normal presumption is that the increase would take effect as of date of enactment absent a clear direction by congress to the contrary a law takes effect on the date of its enactment gozlonperetz v united states 498 us 395 404 1991 nothing in the bill appears to meet this high clear direction to the contrary standard so it seems very likely that the normal presumption applies a dateofenactment effective date for the proposed criminal penalty increase eliminates the ex post facto infirmity that a pre enactment date such as april 15 would fall victim to should s 3346 be applied to conduct between april 15 and date of enactment indeed the avoidance of this constitutional problem is another reason a court likely would adopt a dateofenactment effective date as long as the conduct to which the increased criminal penalty attaches is conduct occurring after the date of enactment there is no ex post facto issue note in this regard that a statute increasing a criminal penalty cap for conduct beginning before its enactment date but which continued beyond that date would likely not be held ex post facto as to the postenactmentdate conduct see eg united states v julian 427 f3d 471 482 7th cir 2005 thus if hypothetically british petroleum knowingly and willfully began to violate a lease term or ocsla regulation before s 3346s enactment that likely would not preclude punishment up to the s 3346increased penalty cap for the continuation of that violation after enactment the chairman ok thank you all for your testimony let me ask starting with mr ramseur theit would seem to me that if we follow the recommendation of the department of justice and eliminate any liability cap that that brings into question what is the purpose in setting up thisor in continuing with this oil spill liability trust fund i mean if youre going to say that companies that engage in these drilling activities are liable for any and all damages and youre going to also put in requirements for them to maintain adequate insurance or solvency to meet whatever damages might result why would we continue with an oil spill liability trust fund mr ramseur thats a good question as you know currently the trust fund serves as a backstop if you will if the liability is indeed capped in any particular situation the excess amount of damages could be paid by the trust fund but under a scenario where liability caps do not exist the trust fund would have different purposes its primary purpose of providing immediate funds to the federal agencies like the coast guard or epa to respond to an oil spill would still be necessary the chairman but as i understand it that would be a shortterm need thatat least in the case that were dealing with i believe bp has said they are going to reimburse the government for those costs and although the oil spill trust fund isliability trust fundis advancing funds to meet the needs right now bp is committing to go ahead and reimburse for that am i right about that mr ramseur i have seen similar statements in the press but as others have indicated today and is allowed under the statute the responsible party assuming that their liability cap remains intactand there are various reason that can go away as has been discussed todaydown the road the responsible party could submit a claim to the trust fund for moneys paid out in excess of their liability limit thatim not sure offhand what that timeframe is i can look into that further the chairman ok it does seem to me just thinking about it that either we could sort of put our emphasis on eliminating limits on liability for companies that engage in these activities and have much less if any reliance on a oil spill liability trust fundthat would be one regime another regime would be to substantially increase the amount of money in the oil spill liability trust fund and expect in the future that individual companies would have somewhat limited liabilitywould continue to have somewhat limited liability but the trust fund would have been funded at anadequate levels that meet any needs that occurred is that a fair way to think about it mr ramseur yes thats the current situation one potential policy matter congress may consider if you remove the liability capsif an oil spill were to occur in the future the current situation serves as a backstop to help people receive awards in a very short amount of time without going through litigation and if you remove that backstop then im not sure what would occur but the chairman but then we would be looking at the trust fund as a shorttermas a way to speed up the ability of folks to get compensated for damages done so that ifin case someone wanted to litigate a liabilitybut we still might adopt the recommendation of the department of justice and go ahead and try to put in place a legal regime that ensured that the trust fund would be reimbursed at some stage mr ramseur thats certainly one avenue to take the chairman ok senator cantwell senator cantwell thank you mr chairman isnt one reason why we need the oil spill liability trust fund is that we dont always know whos responsible for the spill and so you want somebody cleaning up the spill even before you determine liability mr ramseur absolutely thats one of the primary purposes of the fund to have this access to immediate funds for a federal response senator cantwell weve had that unfortunate situation in puget sound so thats why i bring that up mr meltz if congress tries retroactivity or a higher liability limit to the deepwater horizon spill would you say that its nearly certain its constitutionality would be challenged in court mr meltz i would imagine that given the broadness of many constitutional principles and given that different judges of different ideological stripes take different views of the breadth of constitutional protections it might very well be worth their while to consider a challenge senator cantwell if thats the case that it is this legal gray area wouldnt it take years to resolve through the court system mr meltz it certainly could yes i thinki mean initially youd have ayou know a trial court decision i think saying its constitutional then it would go through appeal and possibly to the supreme court so its a little hard to predict how many years that full spectrum of procedures could take senator cantwell if we look at the exxon valdez it took 20 so thats an idea so thank you mr chairman the chairman all right thank you all 3 for your testimony its been helpful to us we appreciate it well conclude the hearing with that whereupon at 1222 pm the hearing was adjourned appendix responses to additional questions responses of craig bennett to questions from senator murkowski question 1 to what extent does the oil spill liability trust fund serve as an insurance policy for companies operating in the ocs so that while each one may or may not be personally capable of paying for all the costs of a huge spill the entire industry has funded an insurance policy to protect victims and taxpayers answer the oil spill liability trust fund osltf is not an insurance policy for companies operating in the outer continental shelf ocs the osltf established in the treasury is available to pay the expenses of the federal response to oil pollution under the federal water pollution control act fwpca33 usc sec 1321 and to compensate third parties for claims for oil removal costs and certain damages caused by oil pollution that responsible parties do not pay these osltf uses are generally recovered from responsible parties liable under oil pollution act opa when there is a discharge of oil to navigable waters adjoining shorelines or the exclusive economic zone eez question 2 can you describe the claims process for spill victims and for responsible parties in terms of whether the existing system provides compensatory relief in an adequately fast manner answer a new independent claims process is being created with the mandate to be fairer faster and more transparent in paying damage claims by individuals and businesses to assure independence kenneth feinberg who previously administered the september 11th victim compensation fund will serve as the independent claims administrator question 3 has bp taken any action that indicates it may be reluctant or slow to pay any claims for compensatory damages related to this spill answer the coast guard has received complaints about bps claims process and we are working to address those complaints on june 8 for example admiral allen wrote to bp we need complete ongoing transparency into bps claims process including detailed information on how claims are being evaluated how payment amounts are being calculated and how quickly claims are being processed question 4 has bp made any claims against the oil spill liability trust fund answer bp has not made any claims against the oil spill liability trust fund osltf in the context of this spill question 5 if the responsible party were to make claims against the fund and the fund were depleted by a major spill would it be useful to have a mechanism whereby the fund could take a loan from the treasury to temporarily give the fund what it needs answer we would want to engage more substantively on this topic before making a recommendation question 6 how much experience does your office at national pollution funds center have in dealing with claims from major spills that affect so many lives answer national pollution fund center npfc has 19 years of experience in adjudicating claims but this case is unprecedented in its size and scope responses of craig bennett to questions from senator sessions question 1 are the current levels of financial responsibility sufficient in a worst case scenario situation for drilling on the ocs answer the gulf oil spill necessitates a reassessment of the current levels of financial responsibility sufficient to address a worst case scenario for this reason the administration has proposed working with congress to appropriately adjust the limitations of liability for responsible parties question 2 in your opinion do the current liability caps need to be increased answer yes the administration supports a significant increase in liability for offshore oil and gas developers whose actions pollute our oceans and coastlines and threaten our wildlife and other natural resources the administration has proposed removing caps on liability under the oil pollution act for oil companies that engage in offshore drilling and looks forward to working with congress to increase various limits and caps as appropriate question 3 what are the constitutional or breach of contract issues in holding a responsible party retroactively liable is there procedure to allow retroactive legislation answer the coast guard defers to the department of justice with regard to any and all constitutional and breachofcontract issues surrounding any legislative proposal to make a party liable retroactively or alter the terms of liability retroactively question 4 in your opinion are there factors that should be considered when assessing strict liability limits for example past safety issuesviolations water depths pressure depths or natural gas vs oil production answer per our attached limit of liability report we consider the costs of spills to be the critical factor in determining the adequacy of oil pollution act liability limits responses of david j hayes to questions from senator murkowski question 1 secretary salazar testified that the number for the strict liability cap should be determined in such a way as to not be arbitrary but to ensure that the ocs not be only accessible to the bps of the world what are some factors in determining what the strict liability cap above cleanup costs and lawsuits should be answer the administration is convinced that the current liability framework is simply inadequate to deal with the potentially catastrophic consequences of oil spills as noted at this hearing and subsequent others the administration has supported significant increases in liability for offshore developers whose actions pollute our oceans and coastlines and threaten our wildlife and other natural resources including removing caps on liability for oil companies engaged in offshore drilling companies participating in such risky activities should have every incentive to maximize safety and must bear full responsibility for all of the damages their actions impose on individuals businesses and the environment the liability caps for other activities covered by opa which have not been updated in some time should be reviewed and increased as appropriate to more fully reflect the risks associated with those activities in testimony for this hearing the department of justice raised several factors to be considered in developing appropriate caps and transition rules for some of the activities that are covered by opa these included ensuring that the liability rules provide the appropriate incentive for companies working in this field to fully account for the damages their actions may cause and to mitigate the risks of a catastrophic event establishing a legal framework that provides confidence that an individual or business harmed by an oil spill will be able to seek and receive fair compensation and that the trustees charged with protecting our precious natural resources can secure adequate restoration and other compensation for any harm done to those resources considering ways in which new liability rules may affect the structure of the offshore oil industry and the number of market participants and analyzing how changes in the caps will interact with the current liability structure under opa question 2 is there an energy forecast andor economic analysis being conducted by the interior department in terms of what the impact would be on gulf of mexico production and exploration under the legislation proposed to raise the strict liability caps under opa 90 answer the administration is looking at a number of factors including how changes in liability will impact industry structure and markets question 3 how much of the current exploration and production in the outer continental shelf is currently undertaken by independent companies answer the relevant regulations do not require this information when a company qualifies and the agency does not maintain information in this fashion however relying on institutional knowledge from the region oil production in 2009 was approximately 570 million barrels with major companies accounting for about 65 percent eg bp shell and chevron independents and smaller companies responsible for approximately 25 percent and national oil companies responsible for the remaining 10 percent for natural gas production in the gulf during that same period total production was approximately 25 trillion cubic feet with the majors accounting for approximately 31 percent independents and smaller companies responsible for 60 percent and national oil companies for the remaining 9 percent of production exploration is a necessary precursor to production and many successful exploration wells are later converted to development wells due to the high cost of drilling and completing these wells the gomr website httpwwwgomrboemregovhomepgoffshore offshorehtml has information available to the public on exploration plans well permits wells drilling and development plans responses of david j hayes to questions from senator sessions question 1 are the current levels of financial responsibility sufficient in a worst case scenario situation for drilling on the ocs answer for facilities located wholly or partially in the ocs the applicable amount of oil spill financial responsibility to be assured ranges from 35 million for worst case oil spill discharge volumes of over 1000 to up to 35000 barrels to 150 million for worst case oil spill discharge volumes of over 105000 barrels responsible parties must provide financial responsibility certification by surety bond insurance selfinsurance or guarantee coverage must be continuously maintained by the responsible party for all its leases permits and rights of use and easements while the united states has one of the most comprehensive offshore oil and gas regulatory regimes in the world we recognize there are many areas that would benefit from careful review and improvement we are awaiting and will carefully review the recommendations of the special presidential commission that has been established once the commission has completed its review however the deepwater horizon oil spill response effort already has required the expenditure of funds far in excess of these amounts the administration supports increasing the required amount of financial responsibility for offshore facilities question 2 in your opinion do the current liability caps need to be increased answer yes the administration has stated that the current liability caps are inadequate to deal with the potentially catastrophic consequences of oil spills removing the arbitrary limitation on liability for offshore development will create incentives for industry to comply with new standards and seek out and implement best practices for safety the administration strongly supports the repeal of the limit on damages liability for offshore drilling question 3 what are the constitutional or breach of contract issues in holding a responsible party retroactively liable is there procedure to allow retroactive legislation answer the department defers to the department of justice for information related to the legal issues raised in this question question 4 in your opinion are there factors that should be considered when assessing strict liability limits for example past safety issuesviolations water depths pressure depths or natural gas vs oil production answer as noted above the current liability caps are inadequate to deal with the potentially catastrophic consequences of oil spills the administration supports removing arbitrary limitation on liability for offshore development which will create incentives for industry to comply with new standards and seek out and implement best practices for safety companies participating in risky activities should have every incentive to maximize safety and must bear full responsibility for any damages their actions impose on individuals businesses and the environment the liability caps for other activities covered by opa which have not been updated in some time should be reviewed and increased as appropriate to more fully reflect the risks associated with those activities in testimony for this hearing the department of justice raised several factors to be considered in developing appropriate caps and transition rules for some of the activities that are covered by opa these included ensuring that the liability rules provide the appropriate incentive for companies working in this field to fully account for the damages their actions may cause and to mitigate the risks of a catastrophic event establishing a legal framework that provides confidence that an individual or business harmed by an oil spill will be able to seek and receive fair compensation and that the trustees charged with protecting our precious natural resources can secure adequate restoration and other compensation for any harm done to those resources considering ways in which new liability rules may affect the structure of the offshore oil industry and the number of market participants and analyzing how changes in the caps will interact with the current liability structure under opa responses of rawle o king to questions from senator murkowski question 1 your testimony states that many insurance market experts would support a more efficient predisaster risk financing approach to managing and financing largescale oil spill disasters is this feedback youve received directly from energy insurers or is it a general sense youve detected answer since the 1990s financial markets have increasingly been used as a major tool of the transfer and mitigation of a variety of global risk including oil spill risks a predisaster risk financing approach rather than a postdisaster risk financing regime could be supported by insurance market experts on behalf of operators of offshore energy facilities given 1 the similarity of the risks between a catastrophic oil spill a manmade disaster and natural catastrophic risks such as a major earthquake striking a major west coast city or a category 4 hurricane striking miami since both events cause widespread destruction of homes businesses and public infrastructure in the impacted geographic areas 2 the limitations in the commercial insurance market capacity to meet future demand for offshore energy insurance in the aftermath of the deepwater horizon oil spill incident and 3 the enormous upfront selfinsurance capital that operators of offshore energy facilities will likely be required to show as part of their oil spill financial responsibility osfr requirements oil spill risk could be considered a peak risk similar to earthquake or hurricane risk in that it can not be currently covered adequately by traditional insurance and reinsurance an oil spill can be classified as such for several reasons 1 they are low probability high severity events 2 individual exposures are correlated 3 there are a limited number of individual risk exposures infrequent major oil spills to allow the use of statistical predictions of future losses 4 actions of operators of offshore energy facilities could affect the probability that a loss will occur 5 losses are not predictable preventing insurers from setting premiums properly and 6 risks can not be pooled over a short period of time so that one years premiums covers one years losses traditional insurance principles suggest that the risk of a major oil spill would meet these six criteria and therefore might be considered uninsurable and alternative risk transfer or financing strategies could be deemed appropriate question 2 what would a more efficient predisaster risk financing approach look like for instance would it be consistent with risk financing practices for laws to consider different risks that may exist between shallow water rigs dealing purely with dry natural gas as opposed to a deepwater oil rig answer going forward investment bankers financial engineers insurers and reinsurers could create reinsurance sidecars and catastrophe bonds for operators of offshore energy facility to manage and finance their oil spill risk exposure the challenge for congress might be to help the private sector address several issues 1 the apparent incompatibility between the longtail nature of oil spill liabilities defined as claims that are filed long after the accident or event occurred and potential investors apparent desire for short term certainty with respect to the investment return 2 the fact that insurancelinked securities ils have been more expensive than traditional reinsurance and can take longer to issue then buying reinsurance 3 insufficient investor interest and 4 the lack of liquidity and need for a secondary market in which these instruments could be traded the deepwater horizon oil spill incident is likely to precipitate a shortage of financial capacity in the offshore energy insurance market the financial industry could respond to this situation by issuing innovative products designed to spread the excess oil spill risk more widely among international investors risk securitization the development of innovative ils and other financial instruments are being used to increase risk transfer diversify risk in capital markets and increase the pool of capital available for insurance congress may wish to consider the feasibility of catastrophe bonds and reinsurance sidecars a type of contingent risk structured financing for spreading thirdparty liability risks among capital market investors insurers have used catastrophe bonds to manage their exposure to natural disasters by transferring potential losses to investment funds investors typically receive a high rate of interest but risk losing part of the principal if a catastrophe occurs there have been only a handful of companies outside the insurance and reinsurance sectors that have sponsored ils the precedent for an ils in the oil spill risk financing market is a catastrophe bond avalon re brought to market in 2005 by goldman sachs on behalf of bermuda based casualty insurer oil casualty insurance ltd ocil1 ocil is an excess liability insurance company formed by energy companies in 1986 at a time when the commercial markets had ceased to provide adequate insurance coverage for liability risk ocil sold three 135 million tranches of catastrophe bonds via cayman islandsbased vehicle avalon re in 2005 the ocil catastrophe bond however was considered too expensive and investors did not fare well because the trigger amounts were considered too low on september 9 2009 ocil bought back 7 million of its catastrophe bond at 850 per 1000 principal amount equivalent to 85 cents on the dollar to repurchase part of avalon re ltds 135 million class b variable rate notes due june 6 2008 1 bermuda insurance update first casualty bond launched 2005 vol 4 located at httpwwwocilbmocildocumentcenter media20articlesbda20ins202005pdf the solution could be the development of a parametric trigger a parametric trigger would be popular with investors because it dictates an insurance payment when a predetermined level of catastrophe occurs for example an insurance payment may be required if there is a specific amount of oil spilled the parametric trigger would work for investors because of the longtail nature of the oil spill risks and their desire not to wait years for the oil spill cleanup to be completed and costs finalized before they reclaim their principal a parametric trigger would be transparent and involve probabilities that are relatively easy to calculate rather than an actual loss trigger which in the case of oil spill could take years to determine figure 1 illustrates a typical reinsurance sidecar transaction that could be created to increase the pool of capital available for insurance the sidecar allows a ceding insurer or reinsurer to transfer oil spill risks to a newly licensed reinsurance company that assumes risk collects premiums and pays claims losses to the ceding insurer or reinsurer via a reinsurance agreement all figures and tables have been retained in committee files reinsurers typically create sidecars by transferring policies and premiums to a special purpose reinsurer spr that uses them as collateral for bonds loans and equity this allows the sidecar to diversify or spread individual reinsurers risk among the global reinsurance marketplace proceeds from the security offering as well as premium and investment income are transferred to a collateral trust which invests the proceeds and disburses funds to the ceding insurer or reinsurer on behalf of the sidecar to pay claims funds are also disbursed to the holding company via the sidecar to pay interest on debt and dividends if any to the shareholders sidecar payouts are determined via the reinsurance agreement contract between the ceding company and the sidecar and triggered by the loss experience of the ceding company hedge funds private equity investors and other institutional investors provide the bulk of the funds via equity and debt financing to capitalize the alternative risk transfer instruments thus capital market investors were able to get into the lucrative postkatrina reinsurance business without having any underwriting loss experience from the devastating loss event in these cases investors agreed to invest the funds for 2 to 3 years and typically earned 20 to 30 or more return on their investment at the end of the time period the reinsurer receives a commission investors get interest and dividend payments from the collateral trust when the sidecar expires assuming that all of the capital has not been used to meet claims another predisaster financing option to increase risk transfer would be the creation of an associationtype captive that would be owned by a trade industry or service group for the benefit of its members or a grouptype captive that is jointly owned by a number of oil companies to provide a vehicle to meet a common insurance need major oil companies typically organize captives in countries that have a favorable tax regime with more relaxed controls the tax advantage allows the oil company to have a larger percentage of the premium for claims payments the association or group captive could assume the oil spill risk purchase reinsurance to spread the risk to another global insuring entity or transfer the risk to the financial markets through innovative risk transfer or financing instruments that are traded either on an electronic exchange or over the counter a final point about insurance arrangements is worthy of mention the major oil companies that self insure their cleanup costs typically establish a captive insurance company offshore to insure their international oil and gas assets and risks these captives are usually located in a special purpose vehicle spv which prevents the parent owner from having to make public the firms assets or liabilities such is the case for jupiter insurance ltd bps captive insurance company question 3 on page 4 of your testimony you list business interruption as one of the relevant types of coverage available for offshore facilities is this coverage readily available and commonly purchased by offshore operators answer operators of offshore energy facilities maintain various types of marine insurance including business interruption bi insurance coverage bi indemnifies the insured for lost net income that would have been earned had the damage not occurred as well as for refunding fixed expenses incurred during the period of indemnity companies filing a business interruption insurance claim must show that their business operation sustained actual direct physical loss of or damage to the insured property without this proof the bi claim could be denied because as many experts agree the consequences of an oil spill can be far reaching without any need for the oil itself to actually reach those affected contingent business insurance coverage provides payments for damages based upon loss of income due to damage to upstream facilities such as processing plants trunklines and refineries owned by third parties but upon which the insureds income depended this coverage is usually written in conjunction with offshore physical damage coverage on standardized forms published by insurance services office inc or those that resemble the iso form bi coverage is thought to be readily available to offshore operators through mutual insurance associations pi clubs question 4 which companies or how many companies would still meet the financial qualification to operate in the gulf of mexico if the strict liability cap for economic damages was raised to 10 billion and no other changes were made to the financial assurance formula answer this question is beyond the scope of the crs panels expertise however a may 2010 report by wood mackenzie ltd entitled deepwater horizon tragedy nearterm and longterm implications in deepwater gulf of mexico indicated that the increase in the cap on oil companies liability for oil spill to 10 billion would not deter global supermajors and national oil companies from operating in the gulf of mexico but many us independents and their investors may not be able or willing to expose themselves to such an amount for example bp has indicated in its us securities and exchange commission annual report on form 20f 2009 that the group generally restricts its purchase of insurance to situations where this is required for legal or contractual reasons this is because external insurance is not considered an economic means of financing losses for the group losses are therefore borne as they arise rather than being spread over time through insurance premiums with attendant transaction costs this position is reviewed periodically p 40 what is less obvious as your question suggests is what would happen if the liability cap was raised from 75 million to 10 billion without changes to the financial assurance insurance formula operators of offshore energy facilities whether drilling in deepwater or on the shelf would likely continue to meet their oil spill financial responsibility osfr requirements through selfinsurance the corporate entity itself however could become financially liable for up to 10 billion in potential losses and face uncertain reputational risk in other words it is possible that oil and gas exploration and production firms could continue to drill but the investors and owners of the firm would be exposed to a higher level of reputational risk or possible insolvency in the event losses exceed the firms net worth question 5 how many of these companies would be american answer this question is beyond the scope of the crs panels expertise question 6 in your written testimony you highlight three insurancerelated risks to raising the liability limit for damages to 10 billion is it correct that your testimony suggests that theres some possibility that the rest of the american companies who have been producing safely in the gulf of mexico could be squeezed out because of resulting changes to the insurance structure under opa 90 answer the key issue is not the amended limits of liability for offshore facilities under opa 90 from 75 million to 10 billion but whether commercial insurance companies would be able to issue insurance certificates to provide operators of offshore energy facilities in deepwater or shallow water with the evidence of oil spill financial responsibility osfr under opa the point is that the energy insurance market has limited financial capacity for pollution we do not yet know the insurance structure under opa 90 that would eventually correspond to a new 10 billion liability cap or the extent to which oil companies both super majors and small independents would be able to provide alternative security question 7 are any insurers already adjusting premiums to address increased risk as a result of the deepwater horizon incident answer according to a june 3 2010 reuters article global reinsurers have begun to raise prices for offshore energyrelated insurance premiums by 50 following insurance losses from the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico that are expected to be between 14 billion and 35 billion2 actual insured losses and therefore probable premium increases would have been higher had bp the operator of the deepwater horizon oil rig purchased liability insurance instead of selfinsuring its risk through its captive insurance program 2 reuters june 3 2010 offshore premia soar as bp spill hits reinsurers june 3 2010 located at httpwwwhindustantimescom storypageprint552722aspx moodys investors services reported that the deepwater horizon incident will have a meaningful impact on the market for offshore energyrelated insurance coverage with preliminary reports indicating a 15 to 25 increase in property coverage for rigs operating in shallow waters and up to 50 higher for deepwater rigs pricing for offshore energy liability insurance is likely to trend higher as insurers and reinsurers reassess their overall risk exposure from drilling in deep waters in the gulf of mexico by self insuring the exposure from the deepwater horizon incident the exposure of the commercial reinsurance industry to the event along with the need for insurers to raise rates was significantly reduced according to moodys investors service3 like most

wwwbusinessinsurancecomarticle20100509issue01305099971 question 8 on page 7 of your testimony you stated that the availability of alternative sources of speedy financial risk perhaps through catastrophe bonds or energy insurance financial futures and options meaning derivative financial instruments that securitize insurance risk turning an insurance policy or reinsurance contract into a security could provide the added capital needed in the insurance industry to cover the higher liability these are all highly complex transactions can you define what you mean by characterizing them as speedy are these currently practical alternatives for energy companies answer the term speedy was a typographic error the correct word was spreading see the answer for question 2 question 9 can a member of the panel describe the way in which an exploration rig like the deepwater horizon obtains financing answer this question is beyond the scope of the crs panels expertise question 10 can a member of the panel describe the way in which a small exploration rig with very low exploration risks obtains financing relative to a much larger operation answer this question is beyond the scope of the crs panels expertise question 11 can the panel describe the current state of the energy industry insurance market in the wake of the deepwater horizon incident specifically whether sufficient insurance products even exist to cover an individual operators potential liability answer with capacity in the offshore energy insurance market now at about 15 billion there has been uncertainty about offshore facility operators ability to obtain insurance certificates to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility under section 1061 of the opa underlying this issue is the unique lowfrequency high severity nature of oil spill catastrophe risk exposures and the difficulties insurers and reinsurers have in raising capital to insure such risks table 1 shows ocean marine global premiums by class for first party physical damage coverage importantly these figures do not include thirdparty liability coverage for bodily injury and property damages and clean up and containment of oil spills these data are not readily available because the main market players are based principally in london and bermuda and beyond the reach of state insurance regulators based on conversations with offshore energy insurance brokers the estimated total offshore energy property insurance premiums is in the range of 3 to 35 billion annually there is an additional 500 million in thirdparty liability capacity most operators of offshore energy facilities eg modu carry about 300 to 500 million of operator extra expense insurance table has been retained in committee files in 2009 the offshore energy insurance market experienced surplus capacity due to two main factors first mobile offshore drilling units modu rig utilization and hence demand for insurance declined sharply in all oil and gas exploration and production areas of the world but particularly in the gulf of mexico because of heightened hurricane activity in 2004 2005 2006 and 2008 according to the international union of marine insurance iumi the worldwide rig capacity utilization rate stood at 75 in 2009 down from 88 in 20086 the gulf of mexico rig utilization rate was 49 down from 75 in 2008 second the demand for ocean marine insurance has been adversely affected by the global economic downturn the decline in world trade and the drop in market price for oil and natural gas 6 international union of marine insurance pressrelease sharp

wwwnoaanewsnoaagovstories201020100527hurricaneoutlookhtml question 12 if insurance is becoming more expensive and less available and if a 10 billion increase in strict liability for economic damages were to be levied can the panel speak to whether independent oil and gas companies operating in the gulf of mexico are likely to be able to provide any alternative method of financial responsibility such as bonds and lines of credit answer this question as it relates specifically to independent oil and gas companies operating in the gulf of mexico is beyond the scope of the crs panels expertise however under section 1016 of the oil pollution act of 1990 oil and gas exploration and production ep leases issued by the us minerals management services for operation in the gulf of mexico must establish and maintain oil spill financial responsibility osfr capability to meet their liabilities for the removal costs and damages caused by oil discharges from an offshore facility and associated pipelines8 besides commercial insurance operators of offshore energy facilities could demonstrate their osfr in various ways including surety bonds guarantees letters of credit and self insurance but the most common method for most operators of both deepwater and shallow water drilling is by means of an insurance certificate 8 this requirement applies to the outer continental shelf ocs state waters and certain coastal inland waters it would appear that the cost of insurance is not a major factor for major oil companies because they will likely continue to self insure their offshore oil and gas exploration risks through wholly owned subsidiary captive insurance companies captives are usually organized offshore and outside the reach of government taxing authorities and therefore typically pay no taxes on profits and the premiums that the parent pays are tax deductible in the case of bp the parent has tapped jupiter for a discount note means borrowing against the assets and

paying for the costs of an oil spill unless the damages were the result of acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct11 a certificate of financial responsibility cofr is issued to vessel operators who have demonstrated their ability to pay for cleanup and damage cost up to the liability limits required by the opa12 osfr is demonstrated in various ways including surety bonds guarantees letters of credit and self insurance but the most common method is by means of an insurance certificate 10 this requirement applies to the outer continental shelf ocs state waters and certain coastal inland waters 11 lease holders of a covered offshore facility cof must demonstrate a minimum amount of osfr of 35 million per 35000 barrels of worst case oilspill discharge up to a maximum of 150 million for cof located in the ocs and 10 million in state waters as an illustration a worst case oilspill discharge volume of 35000 barrels bbls requires 35 million in osfr while a volume of 35001 bbls requires

discharge of 1000 bbls or less 12 federal register us minerals management service oil spill financial responsibility for offshore facilities vol 63 no 154 aug 11 1998 p 42699 i am not able to say with specificity whether small to midsize independent or major oil companies purchase commercial insurance as this information is considered proprietary however it is generally known that the major oil companies typically self insure their offshore energy risks through their wholly owned subsidiary captive insurance and that they indemnify losses through retained corporate earnings major oil companies with large operating revenue relative to small to midsize independent oil companies tend to self insure because it does not make economic sense to pay the kind of premiums they would be charged to cover themselves in what is fundamentally a risky business small and midsize firms usually purchase coverage through a mutual insurance company like oil casualty insurance ltd question 14 what is the amount of insurance that is available from the commercial market for third party pollution liability for operators and nonoperators before and after the deepwater horizon incident answer while capacity in the offshore energy insurance market before the deepwater horizon incident was between 500 million and 15 billion worldwide there is now uncertainty about offshore facility operators ability to obtain insurance certificates to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility under section 1061 of the opa underlying this issue is the unique lowfrequency highseverity nature of oil spill catastrophe risk exposures and the difficulties insurers and reinsurers have in raising capital to insure such risks congress may wish to consider the feasibility of alternatives to traditional insurance and reinsurance products designed to spread catastrophic risk among capital market investors the development of innovative catastrophelinked securities and other alternative risk transfer art instruments that transfer income received in the form of insurance premiums to the capital market for their assumption of risk is one proposed alternative to traditional offshore energy insurance and reinsurance question 15 will insurance be available for offshore production if the liability caps were increased to 10 billion what would be the impacts on the industry of such increase would this only impact very small companies or would larger americanbased international companies be impacted as well answer we do not have the information on how much it currently costs small independent oil companies to insure against oil spills the offshore energy insurance market is highly specialized the limits of insurance needed are so highin excess of 1 billion in some cases that no single insurer provides them alone therefore it is a common practice for oil and gas operators to obtain insurance on a subscription basis whereby several insurers each agree to accept a share of the exposure these subscription transactions are handled by insurance brokers who negotiate with underwriters recognized as specialists in the energy field the issue is not the liability limit but whether insurers would offer insurance at the cap or whether they even have enough capacity currently the capacity limit is apparently somewhere between 500 million and 15 billion worldwide question 16 are insurers already adjusting premiums to address increased risk as a result of the horizon incident answer according to a june 3 2010 reuters article global reinsurers have begun to raise prices for offshore energyrelated insurance premiums by 50 following insurance losses from the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico that are expected to be between 14 billion and 35 billion13 actual insured losses and therefore probable premium increases would have been higher had bp the operator of the deepwater horizon oil rig purchased liability insurance instead of selfinsuring its risk through its captive insurance program 13 reuters june 3 2010 offshore premia soar as bp spill hits reinsurers june 3 2010 located at http wwwhindustantimescomstorypageprint552722aspx moodys investors services reported that the deepwater horizon incident will have a meaningful impact on the market for offshore energyrelated insurance coverage with preliminary reports indicating a 15 to 25 increase in property coverage for rigs operating in shallow waters and up to 50 higher for deepwater rigs pricing for offshore energy liability insurance is likely to trend higher as insurers and reinsurers reassess their overall risk exposure from drilling in deep waters in the gulf of mexico by bp self insuring the exposure from the deepwater horizon incident the exposure of the commercial reinsurance industry to the event along with the need for insurers to raise rates was significantly reduced according to moodys investors service like most major oil companies bp self insures its oil spill

be considered when assessing strict liability limits for example past safety issuesviolations water depths pressure depths or natural gas vs oil production answer this question is beyond the scope of the crs panels expertise responses of robert metz to questions from murkowski on june 7 2010 the committee asked crs to respond to questions pertaining to crs testimony at a committee hearing on may 25 2010 the questions were relayed to crs in three memoranda delivered separately to rawle king robert meltz and jonathan ramseur some of the questions in these memoranda were duplicative others were unique this memorandum contains responses to four of the questions my colleagues rawle king and jonathan ramseur are submitting separate memoranda to respond to the remaining questions your questions some slightly paraphrased are indicated below in boldface question 1 jonathan ramseurs testimony notes that under oil pollution act section 100114 an incident means any occurrence or series of occurrences having the same origin involving one or more vessels facilities or any combination thereof resulting in the discharge or substantial threat of discharge of oil the administration has indicated in several briefings that this definition gives it ample room to define more than one incident in order to avoid the 1 billion per incident payout cap on the oil spill liability trust fund might the administration be able to define more than one incident from the deepwater horizon oil spill answer at this early date the facts surrounding the deepwater horizon spill are not sufficiently well known to venture a definitive answer to your question moreover opa legislative history sheds little light on the meaning of incidentthe conference report notes only that the term derives from the house bill1 and the house committee report discussing the meaning of incident says nothing pertinent to your question2 1 hr conf rep 101653 at 101 1990 2 hr rep 101242 at 52 1989 crs research reveals only one court decision to opine on the meaning of incident in water quality insurance syndicate v united states3 a federal district court addressed a challenge brought by the guarantor of a responsible party to the refusal by the national pollution funds center npfc to reimburse the guarantor under opa in denying the claim the npfc reasoned that under opa section 1016f1c reimbursement was required only where the incident was caused by the willful misconduct of the responsible party and there was no willful misconduct here in the process of rejecting the npfcs finding that there was no willful misconduct the court noted 3 522 f supp 2d 220 ddc 2007 an incident is defined in the statute as repeats opas definition the incident therefore is not the oil spill under the plain language of the statute the incident is what caused the spill more importantly the incident may be a series of occurrences resulting in the oil spill while the faulty repair of the tow line was part of the series of occurrences that led to the discharge of the oil the npfc was wrong under the statute to focus on any one occurrence event or cause as the proximate cause of the spill it should have looked at the series of occurrences or events that together constitute the incident that led to the spill this quote highlights the fact that the npfc should look at the series of occurrences rather than any one occurrence in defining an opa incident it does not however make clear how closely related a group of occurrences must be before they qualify under opa as a series of occurrences having the same origin thus crs must assume that the npfc retains wide discretion in grouping individual occurrences into one or more than one series of occurrencesand thus one or more incidents if challenged in court the npfcs determination as to the number of incidents likely would be reviewed under the administrative procedure act standard of review generally considered highly deferential to the agency4 4 see eg bean dredging llc v united states 2010 wl 1189903 ddc mar 30 2010 adopting administrative procedure act standard of review for purposes of reviewing npfcs denial of reimbursement claim under opa and characterizing that standard as highly deferential question 2 your testimony states opa liabilities for removal costs and damages should be kept in context as they do not exhaust the potential liabilities of parties connected to the deepwater horizon spill for example clean water act section 311 imposes civil and criminal penalties for oil spills and the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla contains civil and criminal penalties for among other things violation of ocs lease terms or the act and its regulations in addition the ocsla extends the laws of the united states and the law of the adjacent state where not inconsistent with federal law to the ocs thus for example there could conceivably be civil or criminal violations of the endangered species act marine mammal protection act or migratory bird treaty act in connection with the gulf spill the solid waste disposal act also may apply finally opa specifies that state law imposing any additional liability or requirements with respect to the discharge of oil or other pollution by oil within such state is not preempted a yes or no question is there a hard statutory limit to the overall amount of money the responsible parties will have to pay for this spill answer the answer is no note that at least as regards bp exploration production inc the entity that may prove the principal responsible party for the gulf spill the no answer would be clear even without referring to the statutes above in the event of a spill from an offshore facility opa itself places no cap on the removal cost liability of such lessee5 5 opa sec 1004a3 42 usc sec 2704a3 question 3 your testimony states the retroactive increase made by s 3305 in the opa damages liability cap for offshore facilities is ikely to be litigated if at all as a possible breach of bps lease contract an issue this testimony does not reach can you speak here to why there might or might not be a breach of contract if a retroactive bill is enacted answer the argument that s 3305 constitutes a breach of bps lease contract closely parallels my testimony on whether the bill raises a fifth amendment taking issueasking this time whether a bp lease right was breached or repudiated rather than taken as noted in my testimony the taking argument would focus on the clause in the companys lease stating that the lease is issued subject to the outer continental shelf lands act existing regulations thereunder and certain future regulations thereunder and all other applicable statutes and regulations the company might contend that all other applicable statutes refers solely to statutes existing when the company entered into its leasenot those such as s 3305 enacted later on there is solid supreme court support for this interpretation in 2000 the court interpreted the same catchall language in another outer continental shelf lease to include only statutes and regulations already existing at the time of the contract mobil oil exploration producing southeast inc v united states 530 us 604 616 2000 the argument would conclude that all other applicable statutes embraces the current 75 million cap in opa which s 3305 abrogates based on the last sentence in the quote the critical issue for whether s 3305 effects a breach or repudiation of a lease term is this does the supreme courts holding in mobil oil that all applicable statutes includes only statutes existing when the lease was signed necessarily mean that any laterenacted statute violates the lease contract in both mobil oil and another quite similar case6 the laterenacted statute found to effect a repudiation of the lease contract by the united states was one that directly related to the federal leasing process itself thus there remains latitude to argue that notwithstanding these decisions some statutes enacted after a lease is signedthose not directly impinging on matters addressed in the lease or the ocslado not violate prior leases this proposition seems compelling in that surely an oil company with an ocs lease is not immune from all changes in federal lawtax laws occupational safety laws employee pension plan laws etcduring the duration of its lease accepting this proposition only one question remains on which side of the line between the postleasesigning laws found unacceptable by the courts and those just suggested as acceptable tax laws etc does an increase in an offshore facilitys liability cap fall crs can say only that there are plausible arguments on both sides of this issue 6 amber resources co v united states 538 f3d 1358 fed cir 2008 response of robert metz to question from senator session question 4 hat are the constitutional or breach of contract issues in holding a responsible party retroactively liable is there procedure to allow retroactive legislation answer the constitutional provisions implicated when a statute applies retroactively are set out in my testimony as there explained five constitutional provisions are potentially involved as a general matter the takings clause substantive due process bill of attainder clause impairment of contracts clause and ex post facto clause crs refers to the testimony for further explication of the limits on each of these provisions applicability and how those limits apply to holding an opa responsible party retroactively liable as for the breach of lease contract issues raised by holding an opa responsible party retroactively liable these are addressed under question 3 as they relate to a retroactive increase in the 75 million liability cap for damages caused by offshore facilities under existing leases crs interprets your second question asking whether there is any procedure to allow retroactive legislation to refer to congressional procedure leading up to the enactment of such legislation we are unaware of any congressional procedure whose use is required or otherwise allowed specifically because a piece of legislation other than tax legislation is retroactive nor any congressional procedure whose use would affect how the courts would address challenges to the ultimately enacted retroactive legislation responses of thomas j perrelli to questions from senator murkowski question 1 the oil pollution act provides that a responsible party is strictly liable for 75 million in economic damages this means there are very limited defenses to that level of liability can a responsible party be held liable but not strictly liable for a greater amount than the 75 million but have some defenses answer the oil pollution act opa imposes strict liability on responsible parties for removal costs and damages related to discharges of oil or substantial threats ofdischarge in the waters of the united states adjoining shorelines or the exclusive economic zone question i refers to 75 million which is the applicable limitation on liability for damages for offshore facilities under opa section 1004a3 opa section 1004c1 provides that this limitation will not apply and thus liability for damages will be unlimited ifthe incident was caused by the responsible parties gross negligence willful misconduct or by the violation of an applicable federal safety construction or operating regulation section 1004c2 of opa provides that the limitation also will not apply if the responsible party fails to report an incident as required by law fails to cooperate as requested in connection with removal activities or fails to follow an order issued under section 311c or e ofthe federal water pollution control act commonly known as the clean water act or the intervention on the high seas act under opa section 1004a3 liability for removal costs for offshore facilities is unlimited question 2 to what extent does the oil spill liability trust fund serve as an insurance policy for companies operating in the ocs so that while each one mayor may not be personally capable of paying for all the costs of a huge spill the entire industry has funded an insurance policy to protect victims and taxpayers answer the oil spill liability trust fund osltf is a fund established under 26 usc sec 9509 and managed by the national pollution funds center an agency ofthe us coast guard the osltf is funded by various sources including by a tax on petroleum and by penalties paid under several statutes including certain provisions of the clean water act under opa section 1002a each responsible party and not the osltf is liable to pay the costs and damages that result from incidents for which they are responsible pursuant to 26 usc sec 9509c and opa section 1012 the osltf may be used to pay for among other things removal costs determined by the president to be consistent with the national contingency plan and damages that are not paid directly by a responsible party in accordance with opa section 1013 the fund currently has a per incident limit of 1 billion making it insufficient to provide a backstop for major disasters ofthe magnitude of the deepwater horizon disaster question 3 does the department ofjustice have a position on what the dollar amount should be if any regarding increases in the strict liability limit of75 million for economic damages in the opa 90 context answer the administration supports removing the cap on liability for damages for offshore facilities removal ofthe cap will promote investment in safety and eliminate an implicit subsidy ofthe oil and gas industry question 4 is the department ofjustice aware of any instance alleged or proven of the responsible parties for the deepwater horizon spill engaging in gross negligence willful misconduct or regulatory noncompliance answer the attorney general has confirmed that the department is conducting civil and criminal investigations ofthe events surrounding the deepwater horizon explosion and resulting oil spill the department will conduct a full and thorough evaluation of all potential violations oflaw and will pursue any violations to the fullest extent of the law responses of thomas j perrelli to questions from senator sessions question 1 are the current levels offinancial responsibility sufficient in a worst case scenario situation for drilling on the ocs answer under opa section 1016 and the department ofthe interior regulations a responsible party for an offshore facility must establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility for that partys liability under the law under opa section 1016 such amounts for offshore facilities are currently set between 35 million and 150 million the deepwater horizon oil spill response effort already has required the expenditure offunds far in excess ofthese amounts the administration supports increasing the required amount of financial responsibility for offshore facilities question 2 in your opinion do the current liability caps need to be increased answer yes the administration supports removing the cap on liability for damages for offshore facilities removal ofthe cap will promote investment in safety and eliminate an implicit subsidy of the oil and gas industry question 3 what are the constitutional or breach of contract issues in holding a responsible party retroactively liable is there procedure to allow retroactive legislation answer it is not uncommon for congress to legislate retroactively and such legislation is often upheld as long as it is justified by a rational legislative purpose congress must however make clear its intention to legislate retroactively an example ofsuch legislation in the environmental context is the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 cercla commonly known as superfund cercla which retroactively provided liability for releases of hazardous waste has repeatedly been up held by the courts if congress were to retroactively increase the limitations on liability under opa the department believes that it would have strong arguments that congress in legislating to ensure that there are sufficient funds for cleanup and compensation would not run afoul ofconstitutional protections in addition an increased liability cap would only be retroactive in a narrow range of circumstances when the oil discharge occurred prior to the enactment ofthe legislation raising the cap and when the exceptions to the existing limitations on liability did not apply as to possible breachofcontract issues we recognize that there is litigation risk associated with increasing the limitations on liability retroactively but we believe that the united states would have substantial defenses to such claims we welcome the opportunity to work with congress to address the issues associated with the legislative proposals that have retroactive application responses of jonathan ramseur to questions from murkowski question 1 your testimony indicates that the oil spill liability trust fund is vulnerable to depletion and i think we are witnessing that now lets presume the fund were many times its current level at around 10 billion to be clear what are the categories of costs associated with an oil spill which can not be covered by the trust fund answer opa does not explicitly exclude certain categories of costs or damages that the oil spill liability trust fund osltf could address however opa section 1012 33 usc 2712uses of the fund lists specific applications of the fund that shall be available to the president the most pertinent available applications in the context of your question include the following payment of removal costs including the monitoring of removal action payment of the costs incurred by the federal and state trustees of natural resources for assessing the injuries to natural resources caused by an oil spill and developing and implementing the plans to restore or replace the injured natural resources and payment of claims for uncompensated removal costs or uncompensated damages the term damages is defined in opa section 1001 33 usc 2701 as the damages specified in section 1002b 33 usc 2702b and includes the cost of assessing these damages the damages in 1002b include the following a natural resourcesdamages for injury to destruction of loss of or loss of use of natural resources including the reasonable costs of assessing the damage which shall be recoverable by a united states trustee a state trustee an indian tribe trustee or a foreign trustee b real or personal propertydamages for injury to or economic losses resulting from destruction of real or personal property which shall be recoverable by a claimant who owns or leases that property c subsistence usedamages for loss of subsistence use of natural resources which shall be recoverable by any claimant who so uses natural resources which have been injured destroyed or lost without regard to the ownership or management of the resources d revenuesdamages equal to the net loss of taxes royalties rents fees or net profit shares due to the injury destruction or loss of real property personal property or natural resources which shall be recoverable by the government of the united states a state or a political subdivision thereof e profits and earning capacitydamages equal to the loss of profits or impairment of earning capacity due to the injury destruction or loss of real property personal property or natural resources which shall be recoverable by any claimant1 1 statements in opas legislative history indicates that a claimant need not be the owner of the damaged property or resources to recover for lost profits or income for example a fisherman may recover lost income due to damaged fisheries resources even though the fisherman does not own the resources us congress conference report accompanying hr 1465 oil

impossible to provide an exhaustive list of the costsdamages that the osltf does not address two categories that may be of interest are claims involving individual health effects and punitive damages claims regarding individual health effects acute or chronic related to the spill are not specifically addressed in section 1002 nor are they specifically excluded however documents from opas legislative history suggest that individual health effects were not considered to be a part of the liability framework during opas creation2 2 see eg clifton curtis oceanic society testimony before the subcommittee on coast guard and navigation of the house committee on merchant marine and fisheries concerning oil pollution liability and compensation legislation may 11 1989 in addition opa does not expressly prohibit the recovery of punitive damages against a responsible party but some courts have considered the issue and held that punitive damages are not recoverable under opa3 3 see south port marine llc v gulf oil lp 234 f3d 58 1st cir 2000 opa displaces maritimelaw punitive damages clausen v m v new carissa 171 f supp 2d 1127 d or 2003 opa provides exclusive federal remedy for property damage claims resulting from oil spill and thus precludes award of punitive damages for any claim for which the act could provide relief congress did not intend for opas liability and compensation framework to cover all costs and damages as stated in the senate report from opas legislative history while setting a federal liability standard and stating what damages are compensable these provisions do not preclude states from adopting different standards or definitions of damages4 additional statements from opa drafters indicate that state laws and analogous state trust funds would supplement if necessary the federal liability framework under opa5 4 us congress senate committee on environment and public works report accompanying s 686 oil pollution liability and compensation act of 1989 1989 srept 10194 101st cong 1st session 5 see george mitchell preservation of state and federal authority under the oil pollution act of 1990 environmental law vol 21 no 2 1991 question 2 would increasing the perincident limit on expenditures increase protection of coastal residents from the economic impacts of an oil spill answer the osltf managers are limited in the amount of payments that may be awarded for each incident6 under current law this per incident cap is 1 billion increasing the perincident cap would reduce the risk that parties private citizens and governments would not be fully compensated for losses associated with an oil spill 6 incident means any occurrence or series of occurrences having the same origin involving one or more vessels facilities or any combination thereof resulting in the discharge or substantial threat of discharge of oil 33 usc 270114 answer statements from opas legislative history suggest that drafters intended the fund to cover catastrophic spills7 however 1 billion today does not have the same value as it did in 1990 when opa was enacted although opa requires the president to issue regulations to adjust liability limits at least every three years8 an analogous provision for the perincident cap does not exist as a point of reference if the 1 billion figure had been adjusted for inflation it would be approximately 16 billion in todays dollars 7 us congress house committee on merchant marine and fisheries report accompanying hr 1465 oil pollution prevention removal liability and compensation act of 1989 1989 hrept 101 242 part 2 101st cong 1st sess p 36 8 33 usc 2704d4 the administration and members have offered legislative proposals that would increase the perincident cap for example the administration submitted a proposal to raise the cap to 15 billion9 the version of hr 4213 the american jobs and closing tax loopholes act of 2010 that passed the house may 28 2010 would raise the perincident cap to 5 billion10 as of june 17 2010 the senate was considering this legislation and senators have offered several oil spillrelated amendments to this legislation 9 the administration submitted its request for supplemental appropriations to respond to the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico in a budget amendment on may 12 2010 omb oil spill request at wwwwhitehousegovombassetsbudgetamendments supplemental051210pdf 10 see note 52 supra in addition on june 16 2010 the president announced that bp has agreed to set aside 20 billion to pay economic damage claims to people and businesses that have been affected by the oil spill although this development may render the perincident cap a moot issue for the 2010 gulf spill a subsequent catastrophic spill could threaten the current perincident cap threshold as a reference point the 1989 exxon valdez spill tallied approximately 2 billion in cleanup costs and 1 billion in natural resource damages in 1990 dollars these combined figures equate to approximately 5 billion in todays dollars and would not include the wider array of claims for which responsible parties are now liable question 3 can a member of the panel describe the way in which an exploration rig like the deepwater horizon obtains financing answer this question is beyond the scope of the crs panels expertise responses of jonathan ramseur to questions from senator sessions question 1 in your opinion are there factors that should be considered when assessing strict liability limits for example past safety issuesviolations water depths pressure depths or natural gas vs oil production answer precedent exists in opa for setting different liability limits to account for different oil spill risks in particular the liability limit for singlehulled tank vessels 3200 per gross ton is approximately 50 higher than for doublehulled vessels 2000 per gross ton11 a 1998 study from the national research council concluded in the event of an accident involving a collision or grounding an effectively designed doublehull tanker will significantly reduce the expected outflow of oil compared to that from a singlehull vesselcomplete conversion of the maritime oil transportation fleet to double hulls will significantly improve protection of the marine environment12 11 this distinction was not made in opa when it was enacted but was added by the coast guard and maritime transportation act of 2006 pl 109241 the coast guard further increased the limits through a rulemaking in 2009 see us coast guard consumer price index adjustments of oil pollution act of 1990 limits of liabilityvessels and deepwater ports federal register volume 74 no 125 july 1 2009 pp 3135731369 12 national research council doublehull tanker legislation an assessment of the oil pollution act of 1990 national academy press 1998 in the outer continental shelf ocs oil exploration and development sector policymakers may consider a wide array of factors that could influence 1 the risk of an oil spill occurring and 2 the risk that the oil spill could not be contained before impacting sensitive ecosystems andor affecting large populations policymakers could then structure the liability limit framework based on certain behavior the use of specific technologies andor the location of the activity however crs is not aware of a comprehensive risk assessment of individual factors or their combinations regarding ocs drilling activities a rigorous analysis of possible risk factors would be instructive to policymakers with these caveats in mind examples of potential factors may include13 13 for more information see crs report r41262 deepwater horizon oil spill selected issues for congress coordinated by curry l hagerty and jonathan l ramseur technological factors ability to use humanoperated submarines to fix a blowout preventer or install containment devices relief wells drilled and ready to plug an uncontained well acoustic switch for the blowout preventer geographic factors water depth risk of spill near environmentallysensitive areas risk of spill near economicallysensitive areas geologic factors gas reservoirs versus oil reservoirs prevalence of methane hydrates companyspecific factors a companys safety record or compliance record foreign versus us ownership company size or recent profits these factors can be related for instance water depth influences the use of humanoperated submarines and the formation of methane hydrates moreover deep water and ultradeep water drilling technologies must be built to withstand the harsher conditions of greater water depths necessary technologies for these depths are complicated difficult to repair and expensive however two oil well blowouts of notethe 1979 ixtoc in mexican gulf waters and the 2009 west atlas off the west australia coastoccurred in relatively shallow water depths both of these wells were ultimately contained290 and 105 days later respectivelyby pumping mud into geologically linked wells similar to the relief well strategy being employed in the gulf of mexico the deepwater horizon incident has brought considerable scrutiny to deepwater activities and their challenges on may 27 2010 the administration called for a 6month moratorium on deepwater drilling however some stakeholders have filed suit against the federal government for this decision14 14 associated press judge to hear bid to overturn halt on drilling june 21 2010 stark distinctions in oil transportation design technology double hull versus singlehull may not have an analogue in the oil exploration and development sector determining a similar distinction would likely require a comprehensive analysis of the causes of oil spills resulting from oil exploration and development activities congress is not required to wait for a wideranging analysis before altering the liability structure but a revised structure could yield unintended and unforeseen consequences potential consequences from a revised liability structure could compete with or contravene other policy objectives question 2 are the current levels of financial responsibility sufficient in a worst case scenario situation for drilling on the ocs answer the following response addresses this question as well as the subsequent question in your opinion do the current liability caps need to be increased answer the current levels of financial responsibility are related to the current liability limits for various sources eg vessels offshore facilities of potential oil spills the liability limits differ by potential source in the case of vessels whose liability limits are a single dollar amount encompassing both removal costs and other damages the financial responsibility levels are directly tied to the corresponding liability caps current law requires responsible parties for vessels to demonstrate the maximum amount of liability to which the responsible party could be subjected under the liability limits in opa section 1004 33 usc 2704 in comparison offshore facilities like the gulf well leased to british petroleum have their liability capped at all removal costs plus 75 million because the structure of this liability limit is different than vessels the corresponding financial responsibility limit provisions differ as well responsible parties for offshore facilities in federal waters must demonstrate 35 million financial responsibility unless the president determines a greater amount not to exceed 150 million is justified 33 usc 2716c the federal regulations that are authored by this statutory provision 30 cfr part 254 base the financial responsibility amountbetween 35 million and 150 millionon a facilitys worstcase discharge volume as defined in 30 cfr section 25314 for example a facility with a worstcase discharge volume over 105000 barrels15the highest level of worst case discharge listed in the regulationsmust maintain 150 million in

press release june 15 2010 although opa requires the president to issue regulations to adjust the liability limits at least every three years to take into account changes in the consumer price index

with the other relevant agencies environmental protection agency department of the interior and department of transportationto submit cpi adjustments together in 2012 thus the first adjustment for offshore facilities liability limits is scheduled for 201222 years after the passage of opa 16 33 usc 2704d4 17 this act increased limits to 1900gross ton for double hulled vessels and 3000gross ton for singlehulled vessels 18 this rulemaking increased the limits to 2000 for double hulls and 3200 for singlehulls us coast guard consumer price index adjustments of oil pollution act of 1990 limits of liability vessels and deepwater ports federal register volume 74 no 125 july 1 2009 pp 3135731369 if offshore facility liability limits had been adjusted every three years since 1990 the liability limit would be approximately 124 million plus all removal costs unlike vessels an increase in the offshore facility liability limit would not trigger a corresponding increase in the financial responsibility level as a point of reference the 150 million maximum financial responsibility level which was established in 1990 would be approximately 250 million today if adjusted for inflation altering the 150 million figure would require congressional action your question asks for an evaluation of whether the financial responsibility limits are sufficient as discussed above this question is effectively also seeking an evaluation of the liability limits however the question of sufficiency may be applied in different contexts one context may involve whether the financial demonstrationliability limits are sufficient to protect the viability of the osltf the liability and compensation framework established by opa assigns the primary burden of paying for oil spills to responsible parties to cover costsdamages above individual liability limits congress established the osltf this fund is financed primarily through a tax on the oil industry from one perspective the osltf acts as an insurance pool that is supplied by the industry that profits from oil markets as mentioned above congress intended the osltf to serve as a backstop which would be able to compensate for losses resulting from a catastrophic oil spill a 2007 gao report examined occurrences of liability limits being exceeded and resulting trust fund vulnerability although the report only assessed vessel incidents the findings may be instructive gao found major oil spills that exceed a vessels limit of liability are infrequent but their effect on the fund can be significant in our 2007 report we reported that 10 of the 51 major oil spills that occurred from 1990 through 2006 resulted in limitofliability claims on the fund19 19 gao oil spills cost of major spills may impact viability of oil spill liability trust fund updating a 2007 study june 16 2010 another evaluation may involve whether the financial demonstration liability limits combined with the backstop of the osltf and its per incident cap are sufficient to address damagescosts associated with oil spills that may occur in us waters although the 10 spills identified by gaos 2007 report impacted the osltf the perincident cap was not a pressing issue and the viability of the fund was not threatened by these spills thus one could argue that opas individual liability and trust fund framework has been sufficient to address all spills that have occurred since the 1989 exxon valdez on the other hand one could argue that fund was particularly vulnerable at periods during the past two decades for instance prior to two separate actions by the 109th congress fund managers projected the fund would be completely depleted by fy2009 in fy2006 the trust fund balance was approximately 600 million and managers were concerned that one costly accidental could deplete the fund entirely during this time period the 1 billion perincident cap was less of an issue the current combination of liability limits and 1 billion per incident cap is not sufficient to withstand a spill with damagescosts that exceed the liability limit assuming it would apply by 1 billion historically such spills have been rare the united states has not encountered a spill comparable to the current gulf spill since the 1989 valdez however if the valdez were to occur today its costs would exceed the 1 billion threshold several times over assuming the responsible partys liability limits were applied the exxon valdez spill tallied approximately 2 billion in cleanup costs and 1 billion in natural resource damages in 1990 dollars these combined figures equate to approximately 5 billion in todays dollars and would not include the wider array of claims for which responsible parties are now liable as the 2010 gulf spill continues with a magnitude eclipsing the valdez spill several times over the adequacy of the liability and compensation framework has received considerable scrutiny these issues and concerns highlight a central policy debate how should policymakers allocate the costs associated with a catastrophic oil spill assuming liability limits would apply what share of costs should be borne by the responsible party eg oil vessel owner operators compared to other groups such as the oil industry eg through the perbarrel tax andor the general treasury assuming congress would appropriate funds to compensate for unpaid costs damages in addition what role should state laws play opa does not preempt states from imposing additional liability or requirements relating to oil spills drafters expected that state laws and analogous state trust funds could supplement if necessary the federal liability framework under opa however pursuing legal remedies outside of the opa framework may require extensive litigation for claimants as mentioned above the liability limit and financial responsibility demonstration for offshore facilities are the same figures they were in 1990 thus due to inflation the responsible party shares less of the potential cost today than it did in 1990 restoring the 1990 opa costsharing ratio would require an inflation adjustment in the offshore facility liability limits to 124 million plus removal costs financial responsibility demonstration to 250 million and the perincident cap for the osltf to 16 billion although it is too early to accurately assess whether these revised figures would be sufficient to provide compensation and address the impacts from the current spill many observers estimate and proposed legislation indicates that these figures would be inadequate20 20 recent legislative proposals offer some indication of obervers expectations of potential costs for example the administration proposed to raise the cap to 15 billion the version of hr 4213 the american jobs and closing tax loopholes act of 2010 that passed the house may 28 2010 would raise the perincident cap to 5 billion s 3305 menendez would raise the offshore facility liability limit to 10 billion s 3472 menendez would remove the liability cap entirely further on june 16 2010 the president announced that bp has agreed to set aside 20 billion to pay economic damage claims to people and businesses that have been affected by the oil spill question 3 in your opinion do the current liability caps need to be increased answer see response to the above question",

            "body": "the nytpicker huh using anonymous and dubious sources nyt wonders whether gulf of mexico oil spill is really that bad a bizarre pageone news analysis about the gulf of mexico oil spill today asserts that the damage isnt going to be as bad as you think and lamely attempts to prove its point with anonymous sources and experts with ties to the oil industry itself under the headline bad but an apocalypse reporters john m broder and tom zeller jr attempt to put recent events in historical perspective reminding us of the damage wreaked by such memorable spills as the exxon valdez in 1989 or the ixtoc 1 in 1979 which dumped 140 million gallons of crude oil after quoting president obamas assertion that the spill is potentially unprecedented the reporters counter with several unprovable assertions designed to suggest that the presidents concerns may be misplaced a view presumably shared by the corporate interests charged with cleaning up the horrific mess they made yet the deepwater horizon blowout is not unprecedented the reporters assert without explanation or attribution nor is it yet among the worst oil accidents in history how does the nyt know this an expert told them which expert oh you knowan unnamed expert and to add to the problem its an unnamed expert who speaks in meaningless metaphors and is allowed to do so in the storys fifth paragraph right there on the front page of the nyt as one expert put it broder and zeller write this is the first inning of a nineinning game no one knows the final score yikes lets just hope our team wins and the game doesnt go into extra innings to be sure broder and zeller take note of those who worry that this latest spill may hurt the regions land areas and wildlife no one the reporters declare not even the oil industrys most fervent apologists is making light of this accident what a relief to know that bp executives havent started regaling themselves with oil slick jokes but the news analysis moves quickly to quote experts who suggest that favorable wind conditions mean the worst could be avoided the nyt turns next for a quote to edward b overton professor emeritus of environmental science at louisiana state who compares this spill favorably with the exxon valdez right now what people are fearing has not materialize people have the idea of an exxon valdez with a gunky smelly black tide looming over the horizon waiting to wash ashore i do not anticipate this will happen down here unless things get a lot worse but overton has been quoted elsewhere in the media making the opposite statement arguing that this spill has been among the most devastating in history specifically overton has warned that based on early analysis the spill could include a heavy crude oil potentially devestating to the environment of the region from the los angeles times on may 1 just three days ago the analysis is based on only a single sample but it has caused my level of apprehension to go way up said environmental scientist edward b overton of louisiana state university who is analyzing the oil for the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration so far he appears to be the only researcher who thinks there may be a biggerthanexpected problem with the oil were hoping and praying that it is louisiana sweet crude overton added but if it is notthis is going to be a very unique spill we have never seen a spill with this high an asphaltenic content why is the nyt now quoting overton making the opposite point the nyt story goes on to says that while the potential for catastrophe remained there were reasons to remain guardedly optimistic to support that point the reporters deliver the ultimate cliche quote and from an expert with direct though undisclosed ties to the oil industry itself the sky isnt falling quenton r dokken executive director of the gulf of mexico foundation told the nyt weve certainly stepped in a hole and were going to have to work ourselves out of it but it isnt the end of the gulf of mexico the gulf of mexico foundation in case you were wondering is a nonprofit organization supported largely by grants from the oil companies themselves most of the members of its board of directors are executives at the oil companies currently on the foundations board of directors dr ian hudson head of corporate responsibility at transocean the offshore drilling contractor that owned the deepwater horizon thats the rig that exploded last month leading to the spill of course this doesnt officially taint dokkens quotes but as an executive whose fortunes are tied to partnerships between his group and the oil and gas companies that fund it including bp conocophillips marathon etc hes hardly an objective observer of corporate malfeasance it isnt until well into the second half of the news anaylysis that zeller and broder get around to interviewing those who think the sky may in fact be falling after all some people are saying it hasnt gotten to shore yet so its all good said jacueline savitz a senior scientist at oceana a respected nonprofit environmental group with no ties to industry but a lot of animals live in the ocean and a spill like this becomes bad for marine life as soon as it hits the water you have endangered sea turtles the larvae of bluefin tuna shrimp and crabs and oysters grouper a lot of these are already being affected and have been for 10 days were waiting to see how bad it is at the shore but we may never fully understand the full impacts on ocean life sounds pretty horrible to us why would the nyt feel compelled to present an essentially proindustry story on its front page so soon after the spill and the public outcry over its effects its hard to know but its easy to see that whatever its intentions the story failed on its most basic task of providing informative objective and ontherecord quotes to readers and letting them make the best possible judgement based on the facts update a nyt editors note wednesday morning acknowledges that yesterdays pageone news analysis of the gulf oil spill should have made clear that one of the sources it quoted who told the nyt the sky isnt falling with regard to the spill works for an organization with strong ties to the oil industry those industry connections were first reported yesterday morning by the nytpicker the story by reporters john m broder and tom zeller jr quoted quenton r dokken executive director of the gulf of mexico foundation as an objective expert on the crisis in the gulf but as the nytpicker noted yesterday the foundation includes several industry leaders on its board including an official at transocean the offshore drilling contractor that owned the deepwater horizon the rig that exploded last month leading to the spill heres the full text of the editors note a frontpage news analysis article on tuesday discussed the uncertainty over the ultimate environmental impact of the oil spill in the gulf of mexico one expert quoted was quenton r dokken a marine biologist who is the executive director of the gulf of mexico foundation he said the spill isnt the end of the gulf of mexico but also said that weve always got to ask ourselves how long can we keep heaping these insults on the gulf and having it bounce back the article described the gulf of mexico foundation simply as a conservation group it should have included more information about the organization a nonprofit group that says its mission is to promote and facilitate conservation of the health and productivity of the gulf of mexico and its resources through research and other programs while the group says the majority of its funding comes from federal and state grants it also receives some money from the oil industry and other business interests in the gulf and includes industry executives on its board",

            "text": "If you have not already heard, on April 20th the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded and sank two days later. The explosion has caused a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Over the last ten days BP officials, responsible for the cleanup, have been unable to control the spill.\n\nThe main source of the spill cannot be controlled at this point. At 5,000 feet below the surface is the equipment that failed to do its job during the explosion. This valve was supposed to control the pressure burst but because it did not, officials have been scrambling to control the spill. At this point BP is proposing that they will lower a containment dome over the spill. Unfortunately it could be another six days before that plan is in action and this plan usually only works in shallow waters…\n\nRight now 10 day fishing bans are taking shape for the affected waters. Not only will these 300,000 fishermen take huge hits from the spill but so will the wildlife. Today 20 sea turtles were found dead along the Mississippi coast. Volunteers are swarming the shores from Mississippi to Florida to protect the wildlife and beaches. I cannot imagine the damage that will be done to the wetlands and coral reefs of this area if the spill remains out of control. At this point everything that can be done is being done but it still is not enough.\n\nAfter hearing about this and looking at the pictures, I would agree with Obama’s words, that this is a, “potentially unprecedented environmental disaster.”",

            "text": "WASHINGTON -- The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is bad -- no one would dispute it. But just how bad?\n\nSome experts have been quick to predict apocalypse, painting grim pictures of 1,000 miles of irreplaceable wetlands and beaches at risk, fisheries damaged for seasons, fragile species wiped out and a region and an industry economically crippled for years.\n\nPresident Obama has called the spill ''a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster.'' And some scientists have suggested that the oil might hitch a ride on the loop current in the gulf, bringing havoc to the Atlantic Coast.\n\nYet the Deepwater Horizon blowout is not unprecedented, nor is it yet among the worst oil accidents in history. And its ultimate impact will depend on a long list of interlinked variables, including the weather, ocean currents, the properties of the oil involved and the success or failure of the frantic efforts to stanch the flow and remediate its effects.\n\nAs one expert put it, this is the first inning of a nine-inning game. No one knows the final score.\n\nThe ruptured well, currently pouring an estimated 210,000 gallons of oil a day into the gulf, could flow for years and still not begin to approach the 252 million to 336 million gallons of oil spilled by retreating Iraqi forces when they left Kuwait in 1991. It is not yet close to the magnitude of the Ixtoc I blowout in the Bay of Campeche in Mexico in 1979, which spilled an estimated 140 million gallons of crude before the gusher could be stopped.\n\nAnd it will have to get much worse before it approaches the impact of the Exxon Valdez accident of 1989, which contaminated 1,300 miles of largely untouched shoreline and killed tens of thousands of seabirds, otters and seals along with 250 eagles and 22 killer whales.\n\nNo one, not even the oil industry's most fervent apologists, is making light of this accident. The contaminated area of the gulf continues to spread, and oil has been found in some of the fragile marshes at the tip of Louisiana. The beaches and coral reefs of the Florida Keys could be hit if the slick is captured by the gulf's clockwise loop current.\n\nBut on Monday, the wind was pushing the slick in the opposite direction, away from the current. The worst effects of the spill have yet to be felt. And if efforts to contain the oil are even partly successful and the weather cooperates, the worst could be avoided.\n\n''Right now what people are fearing has not materialized,'' said Edward B. Overton, professor emeritus of environmental science at Louisiana State University and an expert on oil spills. ''People have the idea of an Exxon Valdez, with a gunky, smelly black tide looming over the horizon waiting to wash ashore. I do not anticipate this will happen down here unless things get a lot worse.''\n\nDr. Overton said he was hopeful that efforts by BP to place containment structures over the leaking parts of the well will succeed, although he said it was a difficult task that could actually make things worse by damaging undersea pipes.\n\nOther experts said that while the potential for catastrophe remained, there were reasons to remain guardedly optimistic.\n\n''The sky is not falling,'' said Quenton R. Dokken, a marine biologist and the executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Foundation, a conservation group in Corpus Christi, Tex. ''We've certainly stepped in a hole and we're going to have to work ourselves out of it, but it isn't the end of the Gulf of Mexico.''\n\nEngineers said the type of oil pouring out is lighter than the heavy crude spilled by the Exxon Valdez, evaporates more quickly and is easier to burn. It also appears to respond to the use of dispersants, which break up globs of oil and help them sink. The oil is still capable of significant damage, particularly when it is churned up with water and forms a sort of mousse that floats and can travel long distances.\n\nJacqueline Savitz, a senior scientist at Oceana, a nonprofit environmental group, said that much of the damage was already taking place far offshore and out of sight of surveillance aircraft and research vessels.\n\n''Some people are saying, It hasn't gotten to shore yet so it's all good,'' she said. ''But a lot of animals live in the ocean, and a spill like this becomes bad for marine life as soon as it hits the water. You have endangered sea turtles, the larvae of bluefin tuna, shrimp and crabs and oysters, grouper. A lot of these are already being affected and have been for 10 days. We're waiting to see how bad it is at the shore, but we may never fully understand the full impacts on ocean life.''\n\nThe economic impact is as uncertain as the environmental damage. With several million gallons of medium crude in the water already, some experts are predicting wide economic harm. Experts at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies in Corpus Christi, for example, estimated that as much as $1.6 billion of annual economic activity and services -- including effects on tourism, fishing and even less tangible services like the storm protection provided by wetlands -- could be at risk.\n\n''And that's really only the tip of the iceberg,'' said David Yoskowitz, who holds the endowed chair for socioeconomics at the institute. ''It's still early in the game, and there's a lot of potential downstream impacts, a lot of multiplier impacts.''\n\nBut much of this damage could be avoided if the various tactics employed by BP and government technicians pay off in the coming days.

BP technicians are trying to inject dispersants deep below the surface, which could reduce the impact on aquatic life. Winds and currents could move the globs of emulsified oil away from coastal shellfish breeding grounds.\n\nThe gulf is not a pristine environment and has survived both chronic and acute pollution problems before. Thousands of gallons of oil flow into the gulf from natural undersea well seeps every day, engineers say, and the scores of refineries and chemical plants that line the shore from Mexico to Mississippi pour untold volumes of pollutants into the water.\n\nAfter the Ixtoc spill 31 years ago, the second-largest oil release in history, the gulf rebounded. Within three years, there was little visible trace of the spill off the Mexican coast, which was compounded by a tanker accident in the gulf a few months later that released 2.6 million additional gallons, experts said.\n\n''The gulf is tremendously resilient,'' said Dr. Dokken, the marine biologist. ''But we've always got to ask ourselves how long can we keep heaping these insults on the gulf and having it bounce back. As a scientist, I have to say I just don't know.''\n\nPHOTO: Tens of thousands of seabirds, as well as otters, seals and other animals, were killed by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989.

Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images.\n\nPresident Barack Obama on Sunday called the growing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that continues to creep toward coastlines in three states a “potentially unprecedented environmental disaster.”\n\nThe spill “could seriously damage the economy and the environment of our gulf states and it could extend for a long time,” President Obama said. “It could jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who call this place home.”\n\nThe slick is now approximately 6,800 square miles — roughly the size of Puerto Rico — since the April 20 explosion on a BP drilling rig that led to the spill. Speaking on NPR on Monday, the company’s chief executive officer, Tony Hayward, said: “We will absolutely be paying for the clean-up operation. There’s no doubt about that.”\n\nWhile stormy weather over the weekend limited the cleanup effort, Hayward said the company will begin work Monday to install a shutoff valve on one of three underwater leaks. BP workers will attempt to lower a containment dome over the largest leak and pump the oil to the surface. The method is untested in such deep waters, however, and will take at least six days to set up.\n\nMeantime, the federal government has ordered a 10-day ban on fishing in waters affected by the spill, a major hit to Louisiana’s $1.8 billion seafood industry.\n\nLaw enforcement officials are searching for a suspect they believe may be connected to a failed car bombing in New York’s Times Square on Saturday night.\n\nOfficials “were reviewing surveillance footage that showed a white man who appeared to be in his 40s walking away from the area as he looked over his shoulder and removed a layer of clothing,” the New York Times reports.\n\nThe car bomb, which was discovered inside a dark green Nissan Pathfinder, was made up of gasoline, propane, firecrackers and what officials say were eight bags of a non-explosive fertilizer. If the device had gone off, it “would have caused casualties” and “a significant fireball,” New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelley said Sunday.\n\nAuthorities say they are treating the incident as a potential terrorist attack. Thus far, however, there was no evidence to support a claim of responsibility by the Pakistani Taliban.\n\nUnited Airlines announced Monday it will merge with rival carrier Continental in a $3 billion deal that if approved would create the world’s largest airline.\n\n“The deal is the culmination of a lengthy search by United CEO Glenn Tilton for a partner that would bolster his carrier’s global network and that would promote consolidation in a badly fragmented industry plagued by chronic losses,” reports the Chicago Tribune.\n\nThe merger will make the business outlook a little less bleak for both carriers in an industry with a “gruesome” economic landscape, says Planet Money. “But the picture will still be pretty ugly.”",

reaction— and delayed reaction at that — rather than proaction is reflected in the law and oil regulation as it currently exists i dont mean to imply the gulf spill was caused by government regulations but the nature of our current system of industrial selfregulation coupled with the punitive form post accident response takes engenders unanticipated consequences primary among them very slow guarded and secretive response to signs of crisis why in part because of the structure of regulation itself unlike conventionally conceived forms of law enforcement that are predicated on a belief that violators will do everything within their power to avoid getting caught oil industry regulators — such as the minerals management service mms and the coast guard — are almost completely dependant on the violator — or in this instance the oil operator — to self report this is partly a matter of expertise but it is also codified in laws such as the oil pollution act of 1990 that stipulates selfregulation and selfreporting as the trigger for emergency response when any entity from a mom and pop gas station to a multinational corporation spills more than a barrel of petroleum about 42 gallons the onus is on them to report that spillage before it damages a waterway or significant resource only when spillage is known to exceed 10000 gallons about 240 barrels of oil can the authorities legally set up an incident command structure abrogate private property and compel the offending operator to respond as i noted in silent spill perhaps punishment for violations coupled with selfreporting requirements represents the worst of all regulatory worlds p 77 it certainly does not grease the wheels for a quick and cooperative response this painfully protracted response characterized the gulf spill which is now two weeks in the making the explosion occurred on april 20 on april 22 bp inc claimed the oil on the oceans surface to be residual oil from the explosion fire and sinking of the offshore rig over the next week bp expressed confidence that they had everything under control in all of this the coast guard and mms while initially sending three coast guard cutters four helicopters and one spotter plane to rescue injured workers remained totally dependant on bp and its subcontractors—transoceanic haliburton and cameron—for information technology and advanced planning — and thus response not until the scope of the leaks had been ascertained and bp asked for assistance did regulators step in and step up their response it should be noted that the term leak is misleading oil is currently spewing forth from a 56 diameter pipe at a rate of 200000 gallons a day the lack of a coherent response plan and the posthoc manner of response are also revealing the response to the gulf spill exposes a set of industry priorities— those of the oil producers but also those of the regulators and lawmakers who propose create and enforce regulations while it may come as no surprise that the industrys and mineral management services main priorities lie with greater levels of oil production that concern does not presuppose a deemphasis on safety and environmental compliance or accident preparation some numbers might clarify my point while bp has spent heavily on pr to rebrand itself as the green energy company 200 million in 2000 on rebranding campaign and grossed some 47 billion in 2009 actual human and environmental safety seems to be a low priority as reflected in their track record over the past halfdecade in 2005 their texas city refinery disaster claimed 15 workers who died in an explosion that was the culmination of a series of smaller accidents in 2006 the prudhoe bay shutdown reflecting poor infrastructural maintenance and pipeline corrosion resulted in an estimated 267000 gallons spilled and in 2007 the prudhoe bay toxic spill involved some 2000 gallons of methanol all of these incidences upon further investigation have been attributed directly or indirectly to bps costsaving measures such as cutting back on maintenance and safety costs to improve the companys bottom line and while im unwilling to say that the blowout in the gulf was itself the result of this ethic i am of the mind that spill response has been heavily influenced by a set of priorities bp shares with other industry producers the oil industry has a dismal track record according to the mms there were 1400 offshore oil drilling accidents between 200107 health safety the environment and emergency preparedness are simply not priorities this point is also born out by recent media reports claiming that bp is currently constructing containment chambers to put over leaking the wellhead and pipes on the sea floor that wont be finished for weeks and that the drilling of a relief will could take months spills like this while infrequent are not unknown to the industry and given their magnitude and destructive power require focal prioritization indeed lessons from the 1979 blowout of ixtoc i rig in the gulf off the coast of mexico could have promoted such preparedness it clearly did not questions along these lines — why werent containment chambers on shore and ready for deployment why werent containment crews booms and skimmers immediately and proactively deployed at the start of the crisis why hasnt investment in prevention and preparedness kept pace with the billions spent on state of the art drilling technologies — are not difficult to answer they are a matter of industry priority not technological capacity my final point involves what in the opening i referred to as a hobsons choice that is we approach questions about oil drilling production and consumption as if they were the only choice available to us and the industry and its advocates repeatedly proclaim that oil production with its current technology—such as the heritage platform in the gulf — is safe will have little impact and can be pursued without environmental or safety concerns they tell us — tipping their hats to the santa barbara exxon valdez and amoco cadiz — that such disasters can not happen again yet the very nature of petroleum and the complex tightly coupled systems required to produce it mean that gushers and spills will undoubtedly be part of our future while they are an infrequent occurrence they are a normal if catastrophic part of production armed with that knowledge if we decide as a society that we must continue to drill baby drill we should require oil producers to step up fund research fund environmental and safety equipment fund accident preparation and ensure against catastrophic occurrences in advance we should stop treating petroleum as a hobsons choice the cost of planning and preparing are indeed high but as the gulf spill so tellingly reveals so too are the costs of pretending we only have one choice petroleum without accidents",

            "text": "We asked Beamish for some thoughts on the Gulf spill, and he sent us one of the richest and most detailed posts we've hosted on this blog. His thoughts - focusing on delayed response, the oil industry's priorities, and the future of 'normal accidents' - follow after the jump\n\nA string of questions looms, not just about how the spill happened but about the reaction to the crisis, both by BP and the federal government, and well as the oil industry's requirements for readiness and prevention. These are issues that Thomas Beamish knows well. A sociologist at the University of California Davis, Beamish wrote his 2002 book Silent Spill about a California oil spill that went unattended for 38 years. In his research he became intimately familiar with the regulatory and organizational issues that go into oil production.\n\nThe ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is a catastrophe that seems to be occurring in slow motion. Oil continues to pour forth from the oceanic well with little, it seems, to be done to prevent the flow into the Gulf waters and threaten further the ecosystems that lie around them. Meanwhile, a massive oil slick inches towards the Louisiana coast and threatens Florida and Alabama as well. The president has called it a \"potentially unprecedented environmental disaster.\"\n\nThe Gulf oil spill has the potential to be horrifically destructive. In the coming weeks, literally hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of gallons of crude may wash ashore, coating shorelines, marshes, estuaries, and shallow bays. It may foul an extremely fragile biome that is home to innumerable fish species and endangered marsh plants and an important flyway for migrating birds. This is a natural treasure, not only for the wildlife it supports but for its social and economic importance to the region: fishing, tourism, and oil. The spewing oil has thrown these into stark relief. Yet we confront a “ We are free to choose one option: In the rhetoric of the last election, and as evidenced in the recent energy agenda of the Obama administration, it’s “drill, baby, drill.” Yet even if oil production is currently our only choice—something I do not believe it need be—it must be done differently, and indeed must be done better.

Response to the Gulf spill also coheres with lessons learned from other “man-made disasters.” In what follows I explore three issues exposed by the current oil spill catastrophe that are remarkable in their similarities to previous events: delayed response, industry priorities, and normal accidents. My interest in oil spills began with my study of another spill documented in the book, Silent Spill. That disaster involved slow leaks and frequent spills at an isolated oil field on the coast of central California that, over a period of 38 years, became the nation’s largest on record (20 million gallons versus the Exxon Valdez’s 11 million). And while very differentthan the Gulf's Heritage Platform spill, it is comparable to the current disaster insofar as they involvesimilar casts of characters, accident routines, and industrial regulations. Response to the Gulf spill also coheres with lessons learned from other “man-made disasters.” In what follows I explore three issues exposed by the current oil spill catastrophe that are remarkable in their similarities to previous events: delayed response, industry priorities, and normal accidents.\n\nAs is typical of the government and industry, crises spawn post-hoc reaction in a way that symptoms of a crisis seldom do. Yet it is in attending to the symptoms that a crisis may be averted, mitigated, or at the very least eased. I do not mean this to be a superficial remark: the emphasis on reaction— and delayed reaction at that — rather than proaction is reflected in the law and oil regulation as it currently exists.\n\nI don’t mean to imply the Gulf spill was caused by government regulations, but the nature of our current system of industrial self-regulation, coupled with the punitive form post accident response takes, engenders unanticipated consequences. Primary among them: very slow, guarded, and secretive response to signs of crisis.\n\nWhy? In part because of the structure of regulation itself. Unlike conventionally conceived forms of law enforcement that are predicated on a belief that violators will do everything within their power to avoid getting caught, oil industry regulators — such as the Minerals Management Service (MMS) and the Coast Guard — are almost completely dependant on the violator — or, in this instance, the oil operator — to self report. This is partly a matter of expertise, but it is also codified in laws such as the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 that stipulates self-regulation and self-reporting as the trigger for emergency response. When any entity, from a mom and pop gas station to a multi-national corporation, spills more than a barrel of petroleum (about 42 gallons), the onus is on them to report that spillage before it damages a waterway or significant resource. Only when spillage is known to exceed 10,000 gallons (about 240 barrels of oil) can the authorities legally set up an incident command structure, abrogate private property, and compel the offending operator to respond. As I noted in Silent Spill, “Perhaps punishment [for violations] coupled with self-reporting [requirements] represents the worst of [all regulatory] worlds” (p. 77). It certainly does not grease the wheels for a quick and cooperative response.\n\nThis painfully protracted response characterized the Gulf spill, which is now two weeks in the making. The explosion occurred on April 20. On April 22, BP Inc. claimed the oil on the ocean’s surface to be “residual oil” from the explosion, fire, and sinking of the offshore rig. Over the next week, BP expressed confidence that they had everything under control.  In all of this, the Coast Guard and MMS, while initially sending three coast guard cutters, four helicopters, and one spotter plane to rescue injured workers, remained totally dependant on BP and its subcontractors—Transoceanic, Haliburton, and Cameron—for information, technology, and advanced planning — and thus response. Not until the scope of the leaks had been ascertained and BP asked for assistance did regulators step in and step up their response. (It should be noted that the term “leak” is misleading: Oil is currently spewing forth from a 5”-6” diameter pipe at a rate of 200,000 gallons a day.)\n\nThe lack of a coherent response plan and the post-hoc manner of response are also revealing. The response to the Gulf spill exposes a set of industry priorities— those of the oil producers but also those of the regulators and lawmakers who propose, create, and enforce regulations. While it may come as no surprise that the industry’s and Mineral Management Service’s main priorities lie with greater levels of oil production, that concern does not presuppose a de-emphasis on safety and environmental compliance or accident preparation. Some numbers might clarify my point. While BP has spent heavily on PR to rebrand itself as the “green energy company” ($200 million in 2000 on rebranding campaign), and grossed some $47 billion in 2009, actual human and environmental safety seems to be a low priority, as reflected in their track record over the past half-decade.

All of these incidences, upon further investigation, have been attributed directly or indirectly to BP’s cost-saving measures such as cutting back on maintenance and safety costs to improve the company’s bottom line.  And while I’m unwilling to say that the blowout in the Gulf was itself the result of this ethic, I am of the mind that spill response has been heavily influenced by a set of priorities BP shares with other industry producers. The oil industry has a dismal track record: according to the MMS, there were 1400 offshore oil drilling accidents between 2001-07. Health, safety, the environment, and emergency preparedness are simply not priorities. This point is also born out by recent media reports claiming that BP is currently constructing “containment chambers” to put over leaking the wellhead and pipes on the sea floor that won’t be finished for weeks, and that the drilling of a “relief will” could take months. Spills like this, while infrequent, are not unknown to the industry, and, given their magnitude and destructive power, require focal prioritization. Indeed, lessons from the 1979 blowout of IXTOC I rig in the Gulf off the coast of Mexico could have promoted such preparedness. It clearly did not.

            "text": "Brands are continuously on the hunt for finding different ways to engage with new customers. Especially in today’s competitive marketplace where a variety of avenues are available for consumer engagement. As part of the digital marketing mix, it’s imperative to funnel in targeted advertising that’s aimed at reaching a designated audience interested in the products or services you offer. Google AdWords advertising provides companies with ability to communicate with their customers and new prospects.\n\nConsumers utilize search engines like Google for comparison shopping, finding new products, or services. Google dominates nearly 70% of the search market therefore presenting untapped potential for companies to reach those specific consumers during the time of their search. Google Ads appear across the top, on the side, and bottom of each individual Search Engine Result Page (SERP). Each time a user performs a specific search they will be presented with a set of targeted ads related to their specific search query. The prime real estate space is occupied by advertisers bidding in an auction-based environment to the attention of those users.\n\nGoogle AdWords advertising is a budget-driven marketing initiative. Costs of advertising are determined based on the search volume and competition within those specific industries. For example, the Average Cost-Per-Click for ‘shoes’ may be somewhere around $30-$40 while in the ‘automotive’ industry it may fall around the $70-$100 range. The higher the competition in one given industry, the pricier CPC costs are for each individual click occurrence on an ad.\n\nGoogle AdWords advertising makes it easy for companies to reach a specific target audience of demographic. Using the right set of keyword terms paired by compelling ad copy provides appealing messaging to potential customers. When those specific users search for the products or services that you offer, they will be presented with targeted messaging pertaining to their individual search query. Unlike traditional marketing methods, companies are capturing the attention of a targeted audience.\n\nMarketing can quickly turn into a money pit without having a solid grasp on expenses. Fortunately, with the Google AdWords advertising platform advertisers have the ability to control costs with an ease. Setting a daily spending cap will ensure dispensing of allocated monies without going overboard. Therefore from an advertising perspective, companies are able to control costs with an ease.\n\nIn today’s digital marketing world, brands are concerned with monetization. The Google AdWords advertising platform provides the ability for seamless integration with Google Analytics. Such feature enables advertisers with ability to track user activity, monitor emerging trends, and identify new patterns. For example, with Google Analytics, advertisers are able to track specific keyword terms deemed profitable. The goal funnels feature provides specific attribution information to establish association with AdWords activity. And that’s really only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to ROI tracking.\n\nFortunately for me, over the last seven years I’ve had the opportunity to work with a variety of brands including Charter Communications, AT&T, Audible, and Maritz to name a few, on their Pay-Per-Click marketing initiatives. Like SEO, PPC requires three things for success –Time, Money, & Patience. While Google AdWords advertising yields nearly immediate results, it requires a vast amount of optimization to lower costs and segment a designated audience interested in your products or services.",

            "text": "Recognizing that the surge of media coverage and Internet postings was growing at a faster rate than the oil plumes, BP moved quickly to mitigate the damage began damage control – for its reputation, that is.\n\nNorwich University student Todd Renner addressed the issue of online reputation management in one of his essays for the Spring 2011 session of the IS342 Management of Information Assurance course. Everything that follows is a close collaboration between Mr. Renner and Mich Kabay.\n\nOn April 20, 2010, one of the worst marine oil spills in recorded history began with the lethal explosion of Transocean's Deepwater Horizon drilling platform used by British Petroleum (BP). By the end of the first two months, BP was suffering massive PR damages: BP lost over $67 billion in capitalization within the first six weeks from a plunge in their share value, increasing to $100 billion in losses by the end of June 2010. And if that wasn't a strong enough indication of reputation damage, many BP gas stations actually covered up the company's logo due to losses in business from boycotts. BP needed a miracle – and that miracle was online reputation management (ORM).\n\nRecognizing that the surge of media coverage and Internet postings was growing at a faster rate than the oil plumes, BP moved quickly to mitigate the damage – for its reputation, that is. The first step on its road to recovery was a massive pay-per-click (PPC) campaign through Google's AdWords. BP bought relevant search terms such as \"oil spill,\" \"leak,\" and \"top kill,\" spending nearly $3.7 million in one month (approximately 65 times its normal advertising amount).\n\nEven at the time, BP's approach generated criticism; for example, Pamela Seiple, writing in the HubSpot Blog that specializes in Internet marketing, wrote, \"Critics are slamming BP's PPC strategy as unethical, since it pushes down other search results such as non-BP generated news and opinion pieces that are also addressing the spill. But is the strategy truly unethical?\" She added, \"Instead of spending so much money on highly competitive keywords in a pay-per-click campaign, BP might have been better off in boosting its image by allocating that money to the oil spill's recovery efforts.\"\n\nThe rest of BP's effort in reputation damage control was based on astroturfing and sock puppeteering, which were mentioned in the previous article in this series.\n\n• The Gulf of Mexico Foundation (GMF) describes its goals as including ensuring \"a sustainable quality of life for residents and visitors of the Gulf coasts.\"New York Times article, where the authors quoted its executive director, Quenton R. Dokken, as minimizing the severity of the catastrophe: \"The sky is not falling. We've certainly stepped in a hole and we're going to have to work ourselves out of it, but it isn't the end of the Gulf of Mexico.\" Nowhere in the article was it mentioned that the GMF is heavily supported by the oil industry, with most of its board of directors either employed by offshore oil-drilling concerns or oil-industry dependent companies.America's Wetland Foundation (AWF) describes itself as working to raising awareness of the value and fragility of the Louisiana coastal wetlands. \"AWF offers itself as a neutral arbiter, bringing diverse interests to the table to seek and establish solutions to ensure the sustainability of Louisiana's coastal environment and the economic activities that take place there for the great benefit of the nation.\"Sponsors page lists among others\n\n• The GMF was featured in a front-page\n\n• Actually, AWF is funded by \"A group of oil companies including BP, Shell, ExxonMobil, Citgo, and other polluters….\" The organization's own\n\nAWF sponsored a video starring Sandra Bullock asking for the American taxpayer to pay for \"a plan to restore America's Gulf be fully funded and implemented for me and future generations.\" Bullock quickly withdrew from the campaign when she learned of the oil-industry sponsorship of the AWF; the video seems to be difficult to find now on the 'Net.Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama was widely reported in March 2011 as arguing that  mass dolphin deaths in the Gulf were a reaction to an influx of cold water from unusual snow runoff. Newspaper accounts widely described the Sea Lab as \"independent.\"BP donated $5 million to the Sea Lab in July 2011 and scientists at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration pointed out that dolphins actually swim and avoid cold water.\n\nThe moral and ethical implications are clear. In the age of instant access, ORM/SEO companies are the kings of public perception because the extent of average public concern rarely extends beyond the first results page in a search. A 2004 study by Bernard J. Jansen and Amanda Spink entitled, \"How are we searching the World Wide Web? A comparison of nine search engine transaction logs\" (Information Processing and Management 42(1):2478-0263) reported that, for research from the late 1990s and early 2000s, \"Overall, it appears that Web searchers are tending to view fewer documents per Web query, which might indicate a move to less complex interactions….  [T]he percentage of searchers viewing only one results page is increasing for users of both U.S. and European-based Web search engines. The percentage of searchers viewing only the first results page has increased from 29% in 1997 to 73% in 2002 for U.S.-based Web search engines users.\"\n\nSurely there are ethical ORM/SEO companies, but the ugly proof of exploitation, deception, and manipulation lingers in the digital air. Unfortunately, it is becoming an all-too-common practice (even by our own government) as increasing emphasis is put on public perception rather than on facts.\n\nIn other news, by the end of 2010, BP reported a 30% increase in fourth-quarter profits in 2010 over 2009 – a true testament to SEO.\n\nTodd Renner expects to graduate from Norwich  University in 2012 with a degree in Computer Security and Information  Assurance. He will continue his academic career at the graduate level in the field of environmental law. He welcomes correspondence from readers. He is currently working out of Livingston, MT with the Natural Resources Defense Council and actively seeking ways to incorporate his undergraduate experience into his work in the environmental field.",

            "text": "As we once wrote, you can make the argument that the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear-power plant — which came just 12 days after the release of the film The China Syndrome, a cautionary tale about a nuclear-plant meltdown — helped stop the U.S. nuclear-energy industry dead in its tracks. While other countries soldiered on — France, Japan, Switzerland and Sweden, to name just a few — the U.S. turned away from nuclear, in large part because of public and political fear generated by what turned out to be a relatively harmless accident. There were other barriers to nuclear, of course, including cost overruns and regulatory nightmares; but once the sentiment turned, those more substantial barriers became secondary.\n\nDoes anyone have the sense that the recent BP oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico may come to be seen as a Three Mile Island moment, at least for the prospects of U.S. offshore drilling? President Obama has called the spill a “potentially unprecedented environmental disaster” — just weeks after he endorsed an increase in offshore drilling, to the deep chagrin of a broad swath of his supporters and environmentalists.\n\nTo be sure, there are key differences between the BP spill and TMI, the chief one being that our economy today is (still) very much dependent on oil, whereas our economy in 1979 was not very much dependent on nuclear power. Nor is it today, even though the U.S. does make more electricity from nuclear power than another other country in the world — although, when ranked by share of overall electricity, the U.S., with 20 percent coming from nuclear, is roughly in the middle.\n\nThat said, could the Gulf disaster be just the kind of tragic, visible, easy-to-comprehend event that crystallizes the already-growing rush to de-petroleum our economy? As with TMI, it won’t do much to change the facts on the ground about how energy is made. But as we’ve seen before, public sentiment can generate an awful lot of energy on its own, for better or worse.",

            "text": "VENICE, Louisiana: Shifting winds and choppy seas in the Gulf of Mexico appeared to buy time for crews racing to protect southern US states from the massive oil spill coalescing offshore.\n\nMore than 50 kilometres of protective booms have been laid in and around sensitive coastal wetlands in Louisiana and Mississippi - spawning waters for fish, prawns and crabs, and an important habitat of myriad species of migratory birds.\n\nAs work intensified throughout the region, with more than 10,000 people volunteering to fight the spill, BP said it was close to launching an unprecedented mission to cover the main leak on the ocean floor with a 12-metre-high metal and concrete box.\n\nThe British oil giant, whose doomed deep-water well is gushing an estimated 200,000 gallons (760,000 litres) of crude a day into the sea about 80 kilometres offshore, said it hoped to place the 74-tonne silo over the leak, drawing the oil up through a pipe into a barge. But local fishing communities, fearing for their livelihoods, were under no illusions about a quick fix, with BP confirming that it would be at least a week before it could get the system up and running.\n\nObservers were also sceptical about its likely success: the method has never been used in such deep water. The three leaks, erupting when the drill rig caught fire after an explosion on April 20 and sank, are more than 1.5 kilometres below the surface.\n\nBP is making three boxes, but the first, if successful, is expected to draw away about 85 per cent of the escaping oil.\n\nBP has been operating a fleet of robotic submarines in the murky depths for more than a week to try to activate the blowout preventer, a giant 450-tonne valve system that should have shut off the oil after the accident.\n\nDespite grim predictions, there was little trace of the spill on Monday at the mouth of the Mississippi or along that state's sandy beaches, and initial autopsies on 25 sea turtles washed ashore did not reveal evidence of oil poisoning. The turtles, all endangered species, are in the midst of their egg laying season.\n\nChoppy seas, together with dispersant chemicals dropped over several days, appeared to have kept the slick, now measuring more 200 kilometres by 100 kilometres, at bay. Calmer seas yesterday were expected to allow teams to start skimming oil from the surface of the water.\n\nSome experts were questioning predictions of a catastrophe. ''Right now what people are fearing has not materialised,'' said an environmental scientist and Louisiana State University professor, Edward Overton.\n\n''People have the idea of an Exxon Valdez, with a gunky, smelly black tide looming over the horizon waiting to wash ashore. I do not anticipate this will happen down here unless things get a lot worse.''\n\nThe leak is of a lighter crude than the heavy oil carried by the Exxon Valdez. Nevertheless, the disaster has given pause for thought. California's Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, withdrew his support on Monday for a plan to allow new wells to be drilled from an existing platform off the coast of Santa Barbara.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has also suspended plans to expand offshore oil drilling on the east coast of the US, unveiled just weeks ago.",

We've certainly stepped in a hole and we're going to have to work ourselves out of it, but it isn't the end of the Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nThe piece describes the Gulf of Mexico Foundation as a \"conservation group.\" But ProPublica reports, the group is no Sierra Club:\n\nAt least half of the 19 members of the group's board of directors [4] have direct ties to the offshore drilling industry. One of them is currently an executive at Transocean, the company that owns the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded last month, causing millions of gallons of oil to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Seven other board members are currently employed at oil companies, or at companies that provide products and services \"primarily\" to the offshore oil and gas industry. Those companies include Shell, Conoco Phillips, LLOG Exploration Company, Devon Energy, Anadarko Petroleum Company and Oceaneering International.\n\n[TPM SLIDESHOW: Fire In The Gulf: New Pictures Of The Deepwater Horizon]",

That would make it the biggest oil spill in the US history, according to NTB.The focus now is to prevent any further damage to the Gulf coast, Obama said from Louisiana according to the BBC. Mr Obama stressed that BP was responsible and that he expected BP to pay.BP has constructed a gigantic dome which will be lowered down to cover the leaking well and trap the oil inside the dome, in six to eight days. This was expected to take two to four weeks.\n\nThe satellite photos from Friday indicated that the oil slick is three times bigger than previously estimated, says researcher Hans Gruber at Miami University.The leak was caused by an explosion on Deepwater Horizon 20 April.\n\nExperts worry that the the spill could eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster as the worst in US history.With a spill of 5.000 barrels per day it ll reach Exxon Valdez size in two months, and then it ll be a major catastrophe, says Tyler Priest, from the Universitety in Houston, to Reuters. The slick covers an area of 9,000 square kilometres.",

That nadir can take the form of a DUI charge, a divorce—anything that dramatically demonstrates the destructiveness of their behavior.\n\nIf, as even George W. Bush acknowledged, the United States is addicted to oil, BP's Gulf of Mexico oil disaster is as low as we can go. It left 11 workers dead, hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil a day gushing into the gulf, fragile ecosystems under seige, and billions of dollars of economic damage to the fishing and tourism industries. So now, as in many addiction recovery programs, it's time to pass through the five stages of grief.\n\nDenial: \"The sky is not falling,\" Quenton R. Dokken, executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Foundation, \"a conservation group in Corpus Christi, Tex.,\" told the New York Times. \"We've certainly stepped in a hole and we're going to have to work ourselves out of it, but it isn't the end of the Gulf of Mexico.\" ProPublica later pointed out that half of the foundation's board members have ties to the offshore oil industry and one is an executive at Transocean, owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig.\n\nAnger: \"What the hell did we do to deserve this?\" groused BP CEO Tony Hayward to fellow executives.\n\nBargaining: BP agreed to cover the spill's cleanup costs but not its economic damages. \"It wasn't our accident,\" Hayward said on the Today show. \"The drilling rig was a Transocean drilling rig. It was their rig and their equipment that failed.\" Current law caps BP's liability at $75 million; the \"Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act\" before Congress at press time would retroactively raise that limit to $10 billion.\n\nDepression: \"'Drill, baby, drill,' has lost whatever usefulness it may have had as a slogan,\" lamented the pro-drilling National Review.\n\nAcceptance: Here's Thomas Friedman in the New York Times: \"The only meaningful response to this man-made disaster is a man-made energy bill that would finally put in place an American clean-energy infrastructure that would set our country on a real, long-term path to ending our addiction to oil.\" —Paul Rauber\n\nON THE WEB Join the BP Oil Disaster group on Climate Crossroads.\n\nAt the top of the Atlantic Ocean food chain is the bluefin tuna, a half-ton hunting machine that can accelerate faster than a Porsche. Yet it is powerless against the appetites of wealthy Japanese diners: Industrial fishing has reduced bluefin numbers by two-thirds in the Mediterranean and 80 percent in the Atlantic.\n\nA fishing ban could restore healthy numbers within a decade, but at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species this March in Qatar, Japan marshaled 68 nations to vote against a ban on international trade in the vanishing fish—after treating them to a bluefin sushi buffet.\n\nWhat's motivating Japan and the other tuna-fishing nations is more than a taste for raw fish. Prized bluefin sell at auction in Tokyo for as much as $175,000 apiece. Presumably the very last bluefin will fetch an even higher price. —P.R.\n\nOK, Sierra reader: How do you measure up?

Remember that things like public transit and locally grown food are not equally available. But anyone can ride a bike. —P.R.\n\nCAR SWAPPERS Americans may love cars, but that doesn't mean they have to marry one.

Both countries claimed the 1.3-mile-long islet, hoping to exploit its oil and gas reserves, but rising waters in the Bay of Bengal have swallowed it entirely, solving the territorial dispute.\n\nSMOKEABLE SOLAR Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley are using a genetically modified virus to reprogram cells in tobacco leaves to convert photons into electrons.

seems like an endless parade of horrible disasters that threaten to push the fragile financial system over the edge the massive oil spill in the gulf of mexico that is now destroying not only the the entire economy of the gulf coast but also the entire way of life for hundreds of thousands of people is getting all the headlines right now but it is far from the only major crisis that has hit the united states recently the old saying when it rains it pours is certainly applicable to the united states right now already faced with some of the biggest economic problems in a generation america is also being forced to deal with horrifying natural disasters rapidly growing environmental nightmares and agricultural problems that could end up being absolutely unprecedented so why do so many bad things keep happening to the united states does there come a point when the economic damage from all of these disasters just becomes too much after all how many body blows can the biggest economy in the world take and still remain standing consider just a few of the major disasters that the us is having to deal with the gulf of mexico oil spill industry experts are now saying that the oil spill in the gulf of mexico could be increasing at a rate of 25000 barrels a day five times the us governments current estimate in fact barack obama is calling the massive oil spill in the gulf of mexico a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster so how much is this disaster going to cost well estimates vary at this point but it is being reported that some analysts are already projecting that the costs related to the oil spill drifting toward louisiana from a well operated by bp in the gulf of mexico could exceed 14 billion dollars the cost to the fishing industry in louisiana alone could top 3 billion dollars and it is being projected that the tourism industry in florida could lose even more than that this is rapidly shaping up as one of the biggest environmental nightmares perhaps the biggest that the united states has ever had to face in fact there are some who are saying that this incident has already eclipsed the 1989 exxon valdez incident as the worst us oil disaster in history louisiana governor bobby jindal is warning that the oil spill in the gulf threatens the very way of life of people in his state as bad as hurricane katrina was there are those who are already claiming that this disaster will be worse than hurricane katrina for the region because it will literally take years for this mess to be cleaned up in fact there is a very real possibility that the fishing industry may be crippled for generations by this disaster the disappearance of the honeybees for the fourth year in a row in the united states more than a third of all bee colonies have failed to survive the winter to be more precise according to the annual survey by the apiary inspectors of america and the us governments agricultural research service the number of managed honeybee colonies in the united states fell by 338 last winter needless to say this is not a good trend in fact it could quickly turn into an unmitigated disaster as it is estimated that a third of all that we eat depends upon honeybee pollination are you starting to get the picture most flowering plants require insects for pollination the most effective insect for pollination is the honeybee without honeybees we are going to be in a world of hurt according to worldnetdaily the following is a list of just some of the crops that depend on honeybees almonds apples apricots avocados blueberries boysenberries cherries citrus fruits cranberries grapes kiwi loganberries macadamia nuts nectarines olives peaches pears plums raspberries strawberries asparagus broccoli carrots cauliflower celery cucumbers cantaloupe honeydew onions pumpkins squash watermelon alfalfa hay and seed cotton lint cotton seed legume seed peanuts rapeseed soybeans sugar beets and sunflowers in fact ohio state universitys honeybee specialist james tew recently told the following to the dayton daily news the average person should care bees of all species are fundamental to the operation of our ecosystem so what happens if they all die off you dont even want to think about that but certainly our scientists can find a solution right well the world organization for animal health announced on wednesday that the huge die off of bees worldwide is not due to any one single factor some of the factors for the honeybee deaths the world organization for animal health included in its report include parasites viral and bacterial infections pesticides and poor nutrition other researchers claim that genetically modified crops and cell phone transmissions are also playing a role in the disappearance of the honeybees but the truth is that a solution seems to be very far away right now and we are running out of time the deadly tornadoes which have ravaged the southeast last sunday saw an unprecedented outbreak of tornadoes across the southeast united states officials said 61 tornadoes erupted as a massive storm marched across states such as mississippi florida and south carolina winds inside some of the tornadoes were clocked as high as 160 mph and one of the tornadoes had a base one and a half miles wide the tornadoes killed at least 12 people and it is estimated that the damage that they caused could reach into the billions of dollars the drying up of the ogallala aquifer most americans have never heard of the ogallala aquifer but it is absolutely critical to food production in many areas of the united states the water from this massive underground lake is used to irrigate much of americas great plains but it is being drained at a rate of approximately 800 gallons per minute and it is starting to dry up so why is that a bad thing well the ogallala aquifer is a gigantic underground lake that stretches from southern south dakota all the way through northern texas covering approximately 174000 square miles if it gets depleted the era of pivot irrigation in the region will be over that would mean that the great plains could quickly turn into the great american desert america could very well see a return to the dust bowl days of the 1930s are you prepared for that even if agricultural production continues to grow normally scientists are telling us that the world is heading for a massive global food shortage so what happens if our food production does not increase or is even reduced sadly the united states has only enough grain stored up to give about a half a loaf of bread to every man woman and child in the united states how long do you think that is going to last in the event of a major emergency the truth is that the good times we have all grown up with are not going to last forever the united states is in big trouble economically and all of these natural disasters and environmental problems are not helping things one bit we are not entitled to endless wealth and prosperity just because we are americans in fact we have recklessly squandered the wealth that prior generations have left for us but even as the economy crumbles around them millions of americans will remain in denial until the day they have to cook a dinner of mouse soup for their starving family",

sixissue miniseries from writer brian wood northlanders conan the barbarian artist ming doyle the loneliest astronauts fantastic four and colorist jordie bellaire hulk season one betrayal of the planet of the apes about a star volleyball athlete named mara who develops superpowers in a warobsessed dystopian future the book itself is still a while off but we spoke to wood and doyle to find out just what we can expect and get a look at some concept art comicsalliance according to the announcement mara is a book about fame and superpowers in a war and fitnessobsessed future what was it that drew you to that idea brian wood mara is a sort of future dystopia and ive written a lot of those and one of the most interesting aspects of that sort of worldbuilding is to run scenarios on the social issues to figure how different ways things could play outin mara the citizenry compensate for the angst and ills of society with a hyperobsession on sports on physical achievement and celebrity related to that the people can live vicariously through the story of a single athlete beating the odds and mastering the world around them to a bitter and disenfranchised society thats a balm thats a cool drink of water to a person dying of thirst war is part and parcel of that in our culture war is like a video game too much of the time in mara s world its just another team sport the news commentators dont talk to battles or victors but matchups and winners and honestly the sociopolitical stuff aside its also a lot of fun look at something like starship troopers which while a lot more tongueincheek than mara visits some of the same themes this a dystopia you dont really ever see where the shining beacon of hope is a teenage girl killing it in indoor arena volleyball ca theres a real historical precedent to that too in that germany adopted a strong interest in gymnastics around the turn of the 20th century as a way to build national pride which ended up getting a little out of hand bw thats not a comparison i had in mind but i see what you mean building pride is not whats happening in mara its more of an overcompensation and a comfort in conformity ultimately deep down its a negative thing and we see that as mara our main character manifests with powers shattering that illusion ca was it fully developed when you brought it to ming or was there a collaboration on developing the idea bw a bit of both i did have a complete pitch when i first contacted ming but as these types of things tend to go just talking to ming and seeing sketches and character designs changes the story and i like most writers like to write for a specific artist according to their strengths and weaknesses so when i went to outline the series a lot had changed due to mings collaboration and that will only continue as we go ming doyle brian did warn me that he was envisioning a very sleek expansive technologicallybased version of the future probably requiring a lot of panoramic city views and tricked out military vehicles there are a lot of keywords in there that would strike fear into the heart of many a penciller but since brians an artist himself he has a great understanding of how to write to different creators aesthetic strengths everything ive read so far has only made me more excited to try my hand at portraying these characters and this world ca ming i know youre a big scifi fan or at least a fan of one scifi franchise in particular did you like the idea of tackling a dystopia md i did right off the bat despite my love of star trek and the progressive inclusive future it portrays ive always been drawn to darker scifi as well worlds where the system is broken where bureaucracy or society seem to have gone off the rails and careened into the scenarios explored in alien and blade runner in fact brian got me right away by throwing starship troopers at me which is of course one of the goofier dystopias out there but to me it has quite a lot of relatable insights regarding conformity separation of social strata and glorification of the status quo the kind of mindless idolatry of physical culture in that movie is also a bit of an inroad into some of the more dystopian aspects of our own world such as the obsession with disposable culture and celebrity mara who is herself a huge celebrity with a short public shelf life dictated by both her profession and gender automatically called out to me ca how do you go about conveying all that information visually the cover gives her a very uniformstyle outfit and youve definitely got those stark colors bw on the writing side its a lot of basic worldbuilding and i use a lot of the same tricks i always do news snippets voiceover narration on top of that shots of the city and so on her outfit is her sports uniform and we didnt do this on the cover to avoid competing with the logo but shes covered with sponsor patches and logos youll see in the first issue how the sports event is portrayed very expensive and flashy and techheavy i think i wrote in one of my pitches or outlines to imagine that the budget for these events equals the pentagons war budget and what would that look like so its a lot of little things put together that build out this world and all of this which supports mara and is what she feeds off of the money and the power and the exposure all that flips around on her once shes seen to have broken the rules md brians also done some interesting things with integrating advertising and publicity into the framework of the storytelling itself which im quite eager to get my hands on the news segments the sportscasters the ad placements all of that will do a lot for the background and we havent gotten into indepth talks about our approach yet with jordie bellaire our talented colorist but shes a whiz at setting up palettes and mood im sure shell bring a lot of striking emotional cues to the story as well ca so its the idea that she has an unfair advantage that starts causing problems md i think its a definite case of the nail that sticks up gets hammered down and mara makes quite the conspicuous spectacle shes an ultracelebrity as we discussed and theres a definite societal tendency to take delight in tearing down our most accomplished idols bw there is a rigidity to this society a demand for conformity and an almost religious respect for the game whatever the game may be she essentially shows the world that shes been working with an unfair advantage all this time doesnt matter if she did or not or meant to and thats really only the tip of the iceberg she has superpowers losing her sponsors and her team is really just the start of it ca its interesting that you went with a female lead in a scifi story about a sports hero was there a particular reason behind that choice md theres a notable lack of female representation in comics when it comes to main characters several very awesome exceptions aside especially in the more mainstream superheroic segments of the genre as an artist one of the main selling points of this story for me was not only the chance to explore a complicated multifaceted universe but to explore it through the eyes of a female protagonist im constantly looking for opportunities to portray women as well as ethnic and social minorities in comics and ive always admired brians nofuss approach to including a healthy diversity of characters in his work and since women are underrepresented in scifisports stories well be able to access maras world through a fresh viewpoint bw i would probably say that the majority of my characters overall are women and if they arent the official leads they are generally supportingcast types that command the attention way back at the start of my career it was easy to recognize a real dearth of interesting multifaceted female characters and it seemed like a good way to stand out my reasons have evolved a bit since then and are pretty much in line with what ming just said i dont make a public fuss about it if i can help it but i believe i have a solid track record as far as this goes specifically related to this book i had this material kicking around my ideas folder for awhile and it was really in the wake of the new dc relaunch that i felt compelled to dig it up and turn it into a book and i dont mean the dc books specifically at least not entirely but the discussion that happened around them all i kept seeing was talk of a lack of women in superhero books or superhero books that appealed to women i was a little slow to react but the creation of mara was to prove that yes it can be done and its rather easy to be a creator who produces material like this and yes people will respond positively to it as far as the scifi and the sports thing why not neither of those feel genderskewed one way or the other to me unless youre only talking about media coverage i am not a big mainstream sports guy but i follow a few things most notably olympic sports and snowboarding its very easy to see women represented well there ca were there any particular challenges as far as design goes youve got a particular love for designing clothing in your work ming bw ill defer to ming on this i had a couple minor suggestions but i left it up to her md brian included some very helpful visual references when he pitched mara to me just in terms of how he was thinking the story might read tonally and how the uniforms could look the transitions in maras wardrobe will definitely be fun to tackle as she goes from an adplastered athlete to an off duty celebrity to a renegade superbeing i feel like i get to be her stylist in a way and more generally the whole worldbuilding aspect will be a welcome challenge since thats not something ive been able to really sink into yet but im looking forward to playing with some futuristic technology and fashion ca are there any specifics youre drawing inspiration from for the setting md well ill certainly be watching more espn and pro volleyball clips but yeah tv aside ill be looking at retrofuturistic olympic uniforms slick minimal high fashion designs in the vein of prada and comme des garçons vogue editorials car commercials none of thats terribly specific i know but im feeling my way around multiple inspirations with the aim of synthesizing something elegant brutal and clean that will still retain my own style its a process itll be a lot of almost overwhelming architecture so im thinking mega stadiums and super cities like tokyo and dubai viewed through crazy augmented binoculars bw the environments a very specific element to the story to the overall world building maras city is something of a megacity one we never name and were keeping it intentionally vague for reasons of mass appeal to put it another way its a composite from all cities the wealth of dubai with the media of nyc or la the newness of shanghai and the lights and commercialism of toyko it is american but not one we necessarily would recognize by sight alone in a way its actually a little cyberpunk in the 80s and 90s sense something i have a lot of affection for ca weve talked a lot about the social and political aspects of the story but what about the superhero aspect if you can tell me without spoiling it id be interested in finding out more about what drives the action and what well be seeing on that front md before being a superhero mara is primarily an athlete so her highly honed physical ability is a centerpiece of her personality from page one and a fair amount of action takes place right on the court i havent drawn much in the way of fastpaced sports sequences so im quite looking forward to dealing with such a kinetic character itll be a challenge to capture someone in motion at the top of their game but a welcome one its going to take a lot of careful thumbnailing for sure bw this far out i dont want to get into too much detail but im trying to be as realistic as possible to really run the scenario — that of a single superhero introduced to a turbulent world — out logically theres no supervillains or secret identities or other trappings of the genre and while i know this sort of thing is not breaking new ground i think my approach will feel new and unusual theres themes of alienation and youth and war and ethics involved mara as a superpowered person is not welcome in this world and you know maybe she gets to a point where she doesnt think this crappy dysfunctional world is particularly worthy of having a superhero on its side especially after they treat her so poorly",

            "text": "One of the most exciting books to be announced at this year’s Image Expo was Mara, an upcoming six-issue mini-series from writer Brian Wood (Northlanders, Conan the Barbarian), artist Ming Doyle (The Loneliest Astronauts, Fantastic Four) and colorist Jordie Bellaire (Hulk: Season One, Betrayal of the Planet of the Apes) about a star volleyball athlete named Mara who develops super-powers in a war-obsessed dystopian future. The book itself is still a while off, but we spoke to Wood and Doyle to find out just what we can expect and get a look at some concept art!\n\nComicsAlliance: According to the announcement, Mara is a book about fame and super-powers in a “war and fitness-obsessed future.” What was it that drew you to that idea?\n\nBrian Wood: Mara is a sort of future dystopia, and I’ve written a lot of those, and one of the most interesting aspects of that sort of world-building is to run scenarios on the social issues, to figure how different ways things could play out.In Mara, the citizenry compensate for the angst and ills of society with a hyper-obsession on sports, on physical achievement, and celebrity related to that. The people can live vicariously through the story of a single athlete beating the odds and mastering the world around them. To a bitter and disenfranchised society, that’s a balm. That’s a cool drink of water to a person dying of thirst. War is part and parcel of that. In our culture, war is like a video game too much of the time. In Mara‘s world, its just another team sport. The news commentators don’t talk to battles or victors, but match-ups and winners.\n\nAnd honestly, the socio-political stuff aside, it’s also a lot of fun. Look at something like Starship Troopers, which, while a lot more tongue-in-cheek than Mara, visits some of the same themes. This a dystopia you don’t really ever see, where the shining beacon of hope is a teenage girl killing it in indoor arena volleyball.\n\nCA: There’s a real historical precedent to that, too, in that Germany adopted a strong interest in gymnastics around the turn of the 20th century as a way to build national pride, which ended up getting a little out of hand.\n\nBW: That’s not a comparison I had in mind, but I see what you mean. Building pride is not what’s happening in Mara… its more of an overcompensation and a comfort in conformity. Ultimately, deep down, its a negative thing, and we see that as Mara, our main character, manifests with powers, shattering that illusion.\n\nCA: Was it fully developed when you brought it to Ming, or was there a collaboration on developing the idea?\n\nBW: A bit of both. I did have a complete pitch when I first contacted Ming, but as these types of things tend to go, just talking to Ming and seeing sketches and character designs changes the story. And I, like most writers, like to write for a specific artist, according to their strengths and weaknesses, so when I went to outline the series, a lot had changed due to Ming’s collaboration. And that will only continue as we go.\n\nMing Doyle: Brian did warn me that he was envisioning a very sleek, expansive, technologically-based version of the future, probably requiring a lot of panoramic city views and tricked out military vehicles. There are a lot of keywords in there that would strike fear into the heart of many a penciller, but since Brian’s an artist himself he has a great understanding of how to write to different creators’ aesthetic strengths. Everything I’ve read so far has only made me more excited to try my hand at portraying these characters and this world.\n\nCA: Ming, I know you’re a big sci-fi fan, or at least a fan of one sci-fi franchise in particular. Did you like the idea of tackling a dystopia?\n\nMD: I did, right off the bat. Despite my love of Star Trek and the progressive, inclusive future it portrays, I’ve always been drawn to “darker” sci-fi as well. Worlds where the system is broken, where bureaucracy or society seem to have gone off the rails and careened into the scenarios explored in Alien and Blade Runner. In fact, Brian got me right away by throwing Starship Troopers at me, which is of course one of the goofier dystopias out there, but to me it has quite a lot of relatable insights regarding conformity, separation of social strata, and glorification of the status quo. The kind of mindless idolatry of physical culture in that movie is also a bit of an inroad into some of the more dystopian aspects of our own world, such as the obsession with disposable culture and celebrity.

Her outfit is her sports uniform, and we didn’t do this on the cover to avoid competing with the logo, but she’s covered with sponsor patches and logos. You’ll see in the first issue how the sports event is portrayed, very expensive and flashy and tech-heavy. I think I wrote in one of my pitches or outlines to imagine that the budget for these events equals the Pentagon’s war budget, and what would that look like?\n\nSo its a lot of little things put together that build out this world. And all of this, which supports Mara and is what she feeds off of, the money and the power and the exposure, all that flips around on her once she’s seen to have “broken the rules.”\n\nMD: Brian’s also done some interesting things with integrating advertising and publicity into the framework of the storytelling itself, which I’m quite eager to get my hands on. The news segments, the sportscasters, the ad placements, all of that will do a lot for the background. And we haven’t gotten into in-depth talks about our approach yet with Jordie Bellaire, our talented colorist, but she’s a whiz at setting up palettes and mood.

She essentially shows the world that she’s been working with an unfair advantage all this time. Doesn’t matter if she did or not, or meant to. And that’s really only the tip of the iceberg. She has SUPERPOWERS. Losing her sponsors and her team is really just the start of it.\n\nCA: It’s interesting that you went with a female lead in a sci-fi story about a sports hero. Was there a particular reason behind that choice?\n\nMD: There’s a notable lack of female representation in comics when it comes to main characters (several very awesome exceptions aside), especially in the more “mainstream,” superheroic segments of the genre. As an artist, one of the main selling points of this story for me was not only the chance to explore a complicated, multifaceted universe, but to explore it through the eyes of a female protagonist.\n\nI’m constantly looking for opportunities to portray women as well as ethnic and social minorities in comics, and I’ve always admired Brian’s no-fuss approach to including a healthy diversity of characters in his work.

And if they aren’t the official leads, they are generally supporting-cast types that command the attention. Way back at the start of my career it was easy to recognize a real dearth of interesting, multi-faceted female characters and it seemed like a good way to stand out. My reasons have evolved a bit since then and are pretty much in line with what Ming just said. I don’t make a public fuss about it if I can help it, but I believe I have a solid track record as far as this goes.\n\nSpecifically related to this book, I had this material kicking around my “ideas folder” for awhile and it was really in the wake of the new DC relaunch that I felt compelled to dig it up and turn it into a book. And I don’t mean the DC books specifically (at least not entirely) but the discussion that happened around them.

I was a little slow to react, but the creation of Mara was to prove that yes, it can be done and its rather easy to be a creator who produces material like this, and yes, people will respond positively to it.\n\nAs far as the sci-fi and the sports thing, why not? Neither of those feel gender-skewed one way or the other to me unless you’re only talking about media coverage. I am not a big mainstream sports guy but I follow a few things, most notably Olympic sports and snowboarding. It’s very easy to see women represented well there.\n\nCA: Were there any particular challenges as far as design goes? You’ve got a particular love for designing clothing in your work, Ming.\n\nBW: I’ll defer to Ming on this. I had a couple minor suggestions but I left it up to her.\n\nMD: Brian included some very helpful visual references when he pitched Mara to me, just in terms of how he was thinking the story might read tonally and how the uniforms could look. The transitions in Mara’s wardrobe will definitely be fun to tackle as she goes from an ad-plastered athlete to an off duty celebrity to a renegade superbeing! I feel like I get to be her stylist, in a way. And more generally, the whole world-building aspect will be a welcome challenge, since that’s not something I’ve been able to really sink into yet, but I’m looking forward to playing with some futuristic technology and fashion.\n\nCA: Are there any specifics you’re drawing inspiration from for the setting?\n\nMD: Well, I’ll certainly be watching more ESPN and pro volleyball clips! But yeah, TV aside, I’ll be looking at retro-futuristic Olympic uniforms, slick, minimal high fashion designs in the vein of Prada and Comme des Garçons, Vogue editorials, car commercials. None of that’s terribly specific, I know, but I’m feeling my way around multiple inspirations with the aim of synthesizing something elegant, brutal, and clean that will still retain my own style. It’s a process! It’ll be a lot of almost overwhelming architecture, so I’m thinking mega stadiums and super cities like Tokyo and Dubai viewed through crazy, augmented binoculars.\n\nBW: The environment’s a very specific element to the story, to the overall world building. Mara’s city is something of a mega-city, one we never name, and we’re keeping it intentionally vague for reasons of mass appeal. To put it another way, its a composite from all cities. The wealth of Dubai with the media of NYC or LA, the newness of Shanghai and the lights and commercialism of Toyko. It is American, but not one we necessarily would recognize by sight alone. In a way, it’s actually a little cyberpunk, in the ’80s and ’90s sense, something I have a lot of affection for.\n\nCA: We’ve talked a lot about the social and political aspects of the story, but what about the super-hero aspect? If you can tell me without spoiling it, I’d be interested in finding out more about what drives the action, and what we’ll be seeing on that front.\n\nMD: Before being a superhero, Mara is primarily an athlete, so her highly honed physical ability is a centerpiece of her personality from page one and a fair amount of action takes place right on the court.

It’ll be a challenge to capture someone in motion at the top of their game, but a welcome one. It’s going to take a lot of careful thumbnailing, for sure.\n\nBW: This far out, I don’t want to get into too much detail. But I’m trying to be as realistic as possible, to really run the scenario — that of a single superhero introduced to a turbulent world — out logically. There’s no supervillains or secret identities or other trappings of the genre. And while I know this sort of thing is not breaking new ground, I think my approach will feel new and unusual. There’s themes of alienation and youth and war and ethics involved. Mara, as a superpowered person, is not welcome in this world. And, you know, maybe she gets to a point where she doesn’t think this crappy, dysfunctional world is particularly worthy of having a “superhero” on its side. Especially after they treat her so poorly.",

            "url": "http://hilobrow.com/2010/05/14/city-on-a-spill/", 
            "text": "Late last month, as you’ve already heard — though, unless you live on the East Coast you haven’t given it much thought, just as we Bostonians never gave more than a few moments’ of horrified consideration to disasters in California, on the Gulf Coast, or halfway around the world — an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling rig caused oil to spill from the Pilgrim well, just off the coast of Massachusetts, a few thousand feet below sea level. Every day since then, as you can see for yourself by typing “Boston” into the Google Earth-powered Gulf Oil Spill Map, between 200,000 and 2 million gallons of crude oil a day (according to which estimate one chooses to believe) have gushed out of the Pilgrim well — and oozed inexorably landward.\n\nWithin a few days, the oil had reached New England’s once nearly pristine beaches, damaging (probably for a decade, or perhaps forever) the local fishing industry, and the habitats of hundreds of bird species. Currently, at its northernmost extent the spill has reached Portsmouth, N.H. It stretches southward from there along Rye Beach, Hampton Beach State Park, and Seabrook Dunes, then down along the Massachusetts coast through Salisbury and Newburyport to Boston (via Plum Island, Ipswich, Rockport, Gloucester, Manchester, Beverly, Marblehead, Swampscott, Lynn, Nahant, and Winthrop — quaint names we’ve heard repeated on the nightly news, like a winter school-closing mantra, for weeks now), thence down to Scituate via Quincy, Hingham, and Hull. Hundreds, maybe thousands of seabirds, fish, otters and seals, as well as some whales, float motionless, belly-up, Xs on the eyes, in a sort of foul chocolatey mousse churned up by the dwindling waves.\n\nBy April 29, wealthy private citizens in southern Maine and the town of Duxbury, Mass. (to whose rescue the semi-retired rocker Juliana Hatfield has rushed), had mobilized nearly 200 cleanup vessels — including skimmers, tugs, barges and recovery vessels. Over 100,000 feet (19 miles) of containment booms were deployed along the coast; by the next day, this nearly doubled to 180,000 feet (34 miles) of deployed booms. Hatfield helped fund Duxbury’s efforts by convincing Evan Dando and members of the Blake Babies, Del Fuegos, Gang Green, and Slapshot to join her in performing a moperock song celebrating both Duxbury Beach as a major, unspoiled, natural recreational asset, and Duxbury Bay’s active shellfish industry — thus managing to bridge the gap between the previously feuding fisherfolk, conservationists, and tourism industry professionals. The song, “Feelin’ Massachusetts’ Pain,” has been downloaded over 6,000 times, at $2.99 a pop. So far, thanks in no small part to the combined actions of Hatfield and the Bush and Clinton families, the oil spill has been prevented from spreading any farther north or south.\n\nHowever, these efforts have had, shall we say, unexpected consequences. “Topography,” as the Boston Globe’s Alex Beam parroted, over and over again, “is destiny.” After having saturated Boston Harbor (and its islands), the oil spill — “spill” sounds too innocent, too gentle a word for the horror this phenomenon truly is — bumped up against the mainland.\n\nCurious, we Bostonians flocked to beaches and docks, pointing and gossiping; I’m ashamed to say that some of us even picnicked within sight of the newly formed bitumen. Overnight, however, or so it seems in retrospect, the oily leviathan hunched its dark brown shoulders and o’erleapt our shores. Logan Airport was submerged inside of a 24-hour period. The low-lying coastal areas (a phrase I’ve heard so often, on the Weather Channel, without really thinking about it) were inundated first. Here in Boston, this meant the financial district, East Boston along Chelsea and Bennington Streets, and large swaths of Charlestown and South Boston.\n\nSoon enough, the oil had surged over the Charles River dam, and spilled into Cambridge and the Back Bay. The brown tide extended from Fenway to UMass-Boston in Dorchester. The Mayor, the Governor, Teresa Heinz Kerry, Ben Affleck, members of Aerosmith, Giselle, Jonathan Papelbon, and a woman dressed as (we assumed) Louisa May Alcott appeared on television, reassuring us that everything was OK — while in the same breath announcing that all power to the city would soon be cut off, lest a catastrophic fire get started. Meanwhile, the seaside towns of Revere, Winthrop, Quincy, Hull, and Hingham were evacuated; and once the oil spread up- and down-river, so were Somerville, Cambridge, Malden, Everett, Medford, Braintree, Weymouth, and Milton. Though I wasn’t there to witness the evacuations first-hand, I don’t believe cynical rumors to the effect that wealthier and lighter-skinned citizens were evacuated days ahead of everyone else; or, at least, I’d prefer not to believe them.\n\nDowntown, we saw on television, before the signal was abruptly cut off, the scene was chaotic. Rescuers were scarcely able to move as the oil sucked the boots right off their feet. Trapped dogs and cats couldn’t be removed — so they had to be shot. The black sticky stuff filled cellars for blocks around. Salt water was sprayed on cobblestone streets, homes, and other buildings because fresh water just washed off the stuff. There was looting, rioting, public pot-smoking. Newscasters around the country got their tongues around the word “Massachusettsans.” Molasses Flood jokes wore thin. Still, there seemed no need to panic entirely; no need to join the general exodus.\n\nOne morning, Matthew Battles, my coeditor at HiLobrow, and I rode our bicycles from the neighborhood of Jamaica Plain into town — our destination Copley Square. A few blocks away from our destination, the sludge coating the streets and sidewalks to the depth of two or three inches made rolling progress impossible. I should note that we were the only souls venturing in an easterly direction. I should also note that we had to fend off the attacks of desperate men who wanted to commandeer our vehicles. Luckily, Matthew is not only a ferocious intellectual but a fearsome pugilist. I snapped a photo (below) of a hooligan whose nose was caved in by a one-two combination courtesy of the author of Library: An Unquiet History.\n\nCarrying our bicycles above our heads we trudged with great difficulty along the submerged pavement of Dartmouth Street and entered the open door of the John Hancock building, which was all but deserted. The once-gleaming marble floors of this temple of finance were entirely blackened with oil. Ascending via emergency stairwell, after an hour of stiff climbing, we stepped out into the building’s observatory level. From it we could see the streets of Back Bay radiating in every direction, while below us the road was yellow from side to side with the tops of the motionless taxis. All, or nearly all, had their heads pointed outwards, showing how the terrified men and women of the city had at the last moment made a vain endeavor to rejoin their families in the suburbs or the country. Here and there amid the humbler cabs towered the great Hummer of some wealthy magnate, wedged hopelessly among the dammed stream of arrested traffic. Just beneath us there was such a one of great size and luxurious appearance, with its owner, a fat old man, leaning out, half his gross body through the window, and his podgy hand, gleaming with diamonds, outstretched as he urged his chauffeur to make a last effort to break through the press. A dozen MBTA buses towered up like islands in this flood, the passengers who crowded the roofs lying all huddled together and across each others’ laps like a child’s toys in a nursery.\n\nOnly one other picture shall I give of the scenes which we carried back in our memories from the dead city. It is a glimpse which we had of the interior of Trinity Church. Picking our way among the prostrate figures upon the steps, some of whom were dead, others covered head to toe in oil and barely alive, we pushed open the swing door and entered. It was a wonderful sight. The church was crammed from end to end with oily, kneeling figures in every posture of supplication and abasement. At this dreadful moment, brought suddenly face to face with the realities of life, those terrific realities which hang over us even while we follow the shadows, the terrified people had rushed into those old city churches which for generations had hardly ever held a congregation. There they huddled as close as they could kneel, many of them in their agitation still wearing their hats. A din of supplication and despair rattled the stained glass windows, which until today only tourists had ever seen.\n\nThat was a week ago, and matters have worsened. The neighborhoods of Dorchester, South Boston, the North End, Charlestown and East Boston were drowned in oil; then Allston and Brighton, Back Bay and most of downtown — except for the top of Beacon Hill, which remains above the oily waves for the moment. The southern and western neighborhoods of Roxbury, Jamaica Plain, Mission Hill, Roslindale, West Roxbury, Mattapan, Hyde Park — abandoned, but for a few stragglers like ourselves. Still constrained from befouling the Bush and Kennedy compounds in southern Maine, or the white sands of Duxbury, the oil slick now known as Boston’s Bane has progressed inward and onward. Along the border of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, the towns and cities of Amesbury, Haverhill, Lawrence and Lowell have been evacuated. The territory north of Boston and Cambridge — including Saugus, Peabody, Danvers, Andover, Tewksbury, Wilmington, Lexington, and Arlington — is all but derelict.\n\nTrees and other plant life can survive being flooded by water; when flooded by oil, they begin to wither and shed leaves within hours. Boston’s Common, its Public Garden (whose greenhouse-grown plants were too garish for some people’s taste), the Commonwealth Avenue Mall lined with sweetgum, green ash, maple, linden, zelkova, Japanese pagoda, and its famous elms… blighted. The Back Bay Fens, the Riverway, Olmsted Park — once again, they’ve become a swamp, a lifeless one. The Arnold Arboretum — except for its hilltops — looks like nothing so much as Mordor.\n\nTo the west, the oil has choked off Watertown, Waltham, Wellesley, and Needham. To the south, Randolph, Norwood, and Dedham are kaput. However, by dint of a concerted effort involving booms, sorbents, chemical and biological agents, vacuums, and even bagels and croissants, the suburb of Brookline did hold fast for a few days longer than the once-glorious city which surrounded it on three sides. But the constant stream of refugees from Boston quickly made such defense efforts impossible. Newton’s town managers, meanwhile, had for years been secretively spending millions of tax dollars, not on schools or municipal workers’ salaries, but on the latest technology in spill containment — a wireless network that inflates bladders which employ disposable gas cylinders, or something like that. Details about this network are vague, because Newton was wiped out in fewer than twelve hours.\n\nThe oil spill now covers 2,500 square miles of earth and sea. Miraculously, or perhaps thanks to the near-daily rainstorms we’ve had this spring, the Flood has not yet been followed by Fire. But… that surely will not be the case for long. The fear-crazed summer residents of Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard, Nantucket, and the Berkshires are considering a “planned burn” which — according to sane people — will turn into a holocaust, not only for any men and women remaining within the oil slick’s perimeter, but for every citizen of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, even in the unbefouled regions.\n\nAlong with our families and a select group of friends, Matthew and I have holed up in a redoubt atop a solar-powered liquor store here in West Roxbury. Supplies of goods that we’ve raided from Roche Bros. Supermarket are dwindling, it’s true, but downstairs there remain crates full of pretzels, cocktail olives, and Red Bull. (Fresh prose is in short supply, too, which is why I’ve borrowed two paragraphs from Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Poison Belt when describing the scene in Boston, above.) The black sludge flows around us on every side, three feet deep. Abandoned cars, uprooted mailboxes, and corpses move past our redoubt. The fumes are intense; although the windows of our fortress are closed, a thin glistening film covers everything inside.\n\nAs the photo above demonstrates, our colleague, James, volunteered for the strenuous task of manually pumping oil out of the liquor store’s cellar. Night and day, we can all hear him down there — cursing, sobbing, then laughing wildly and singing “Rule, Britannia.” We think he’s actually enjoying himself, as these are much the same noises he used to make whenever we’d remind him that a deadline for an installment of his serialized novel-in-progress was approaching.\n\nPresident Obama has called the spill “a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster,” but so far, no helicopters have arrived to bear us to safety. On NPR, experts are debating a long list of interlinked variables, including the weather, ocean currents, the properties of the oil involved and the success or failure of the frantic efforts to stanch the flow of oil and remediate its effects. Let them debate! The editors of HiLobrow will hold fast to our position, surviving on gin-and-tonics, pickled onions, and beef jerky, and posting updates via solar-powered WiFi, until the bitter end.\n\nREAD MORE essays by Joshua Glenn, originally published in: THE BAFFLER | BOSTON GLOBE IDEAS | BRAINIAC | CABINET | FEED | HERMENAUT | HILOBROW | HILOBROW: GENERATIONS | HILOBROW: RADIUM AGE SCIENCE FICTION | HILOBROW: SHOCKING BLOCKING | THE IDLER | IO9 | N+1 | NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW | SEMIONAUT | SLATE\n\nJoshua Glenn’s books include UNBORED: THE ESSENTIAL FIELD GUIDE TO SERIOUS FUN (with Elizabeth Foy Larsen); and SIGNIFICANT OBJECTS: 100 EXTRAORDINARY STORIES ABOUT ORDINARY THINGS (with Rob Walker).",

            "text": "About half way through a piece in today's New York Times titled \"Gulf Oil Spill Is Bad, but How Bad?\" reporters John M. Broder and Tom Zeller, Jr. turn to the executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Foundation (GMF) for comment:\n\n\"The sky is not falling,\" said Quenton R. Dokken, a marine biologist and the executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Foundation, a conservation group in Corpus Christi, Tex. \"We've certainly stepped in a hole and we're going to have to work ourselves out of it, but it isn't the end of the Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nThe Times is sure to make note that Dokken is a \"marine biologist\" but what the paper didn't note is that the organization he leads has close ties not only to the oil and gas industry but to the very rig at the center of the ongoing Gulf Coast disaster.\n\nAs Newsweek's Daniel Stone notes on The Gaggle blog (emphasis added):\n\nEarlier this afternoon, ProPublica offered even more detail (again, emphasis added):\n\nAt least half of the 19 members of the group's board of directors [5] have direct ties to the offshore drilling industry. One of them is currently an executive at Transocean, the company that owns the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded last month, causing millions of gallons of oil to spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Seven other board members are currently employed at oil companies, or at companies that provide products and services \"primarily\" to the offshore oil and gas industry. Those companies include Shell, Conoco Phillips, LLOG Exploration Company, Devon Energy, Anadarko Petroleum Company and Oceaneering International. The Gulf of Mexico Foundation's president is a retired senior vice president of Rowan Companies Inc., an offshore drilling contractor. Meanwhile, Transocean hosted the group's winter board meeting in January and sponsored a dinner for the board of directors. Past board meetings have been hosted in full or in part by Anadarko Petroleum Company, Shell Exploration and Production, Valero Refinery and Marathon Oil Corporation.\n\nIn an update to its original story, ProPublica's Marian Wang quotes the Times' Zeller claiming \"space constraints\" were at least partially to blame even though it was \"probably always better to err on the side of full disclosure.\"\n\nDisturbingly, Zeller essentially dismissed concerns about the GMF's industry ties and never addressed the chilling fact that the group has ties to the very company that owns the \"rig that exploded last month, causing millions of gallons of oil to spill into the Gulf of Mexico\" as ProPublica put it in its initial story.",

deepwater horizon rig not only killed eleven people but also triggered a massive influx of oil into the ocean president obama has called the oil spill a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster the cause of the explosion is not known and equally obscure and hazy are the means to contain the oil gushing out from the sea floor already the southeasterly winds have enabled the oil to touch shore and oil prices continue to drop every day on the backdrop of this poisonous spill possibly the only good news from a consumer point of view at present efforts are on to prevent a rerun of the infamous oil spill caused by exxon valdez tanker when 108 million gallons of oil was dumped into alaskas prince william sound in 1989 usually a blowout preventer or bop would shut off any oil leak from open wellheads it is this valve that prevents blowout accidents due to heavy pressure in the case of the gulf oil spill the 450 ton 48 foot tall bop failed to stem the flow bp the oil company did try to use robotic submarines to nudge the bop but the effort was futile and a second bop could if it fails trigger more oil spill recently the us president opened more than 500000 square miles of coastal waters in his country for oil exploration this accident has put that decision on hold white house adviser david axelrod said no additional drilling has been authorised and none will until we find out what happened here and whether there was something unique and preventable here and the governor of california arnold schwarzenegger even in the midst of a budget crisis ended his support for oil expansion while sarah palin was still seen sticking to the slogan drill baby drill right now bp is definitely right now bp is definitely beyond petroleum as it tries to stem the oil vent without entering into a fault finding mission suffice to say bp is in a terribly hot soup tony hayward chief executive of bp said we will absolutely be paying for the cleanup operation there is no doubt about that its our responsibility we accept it fully last week bp was successful in stopping one of the three leaks from the mc252 oil well however in a private briefing with congress members bp is said to have admitted that the spill could touch 40000 barrels a day if the flow continues at present the spill is spewing about 5000 barrels of oil a day at stake are environmentally sensitive areas across louisiana mississippi alabama and florida livelihood of many people in the area and the wildlife with many species of fish birds and mammals for its part bp finds itself in the same position as david cameroon was for avatar the first to do something without a precedent to follow but unlike cameroon bp has to contend with many more variables public anger finding new ways to seal the flow massive

result of it wed have known by now indeed commandant cousteau renowned biologist led numerous dives following french underwater nuclear explosions in the mururoa atoll and noted very little impact on sea life using nukes to stop the leak is the most ecological alternative stopping the leak before too much oil leak is the key speed is of the essence nukes would allow this to be resolved in a matter of days this would save thousands of miles of shoreline millions of animals by not allowing this toxic sludge to contaminate the shore one of the main issues with using nukes is public opinion even though its the most ecological alternative nukes have a huge public stigma hard to overcome mostly due to ignorance nuclear bombs are not intended to be used for peaceful ecological purposes and educating the public on this possibility is an uphill battle this technology was used by the russians the usas sworn enemy at the peak of the cold war never mind the relatively high success rate of 80 no politician in his right mind would sell a russian solution to the public of course bp does not have nukes the us military does of which the army corps of engineers would probably have to design a

            "text": "Underwater nuclear explosions have been used successfully to stop oil leak \n\n Use nukes to contain the oil spill The April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig not only killed eleven people but also triggered a massive influx of oil into the ocean. President Obama has called the oil spill a \"potentially unprecedented environmental disaster.\" The cause of the explosion is not known and equally obscure and hazy are the means to contain the oil gushing out from the sea floor. Already the south-easterly winds have enabled the oil to touch shore. And, oil prices continue to drop every day on the backdrop of this poisonous spill, possibly the only good news from a consumer point of view. At present, efforts are on to prevent a re-run of the infamous oil spill caused by Exxon Valdez tanker, when 10.8 million gallons of oil was dumped into Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989. Usually, a blowout preventer or BOP would shut off any oil leak from open wellheads. It is this valve that prevents blowout accidents due to heavy pressure. In the case of the gulf oil spill, the 450 ton, 48 foot tall BOP failed to stem the flow. BP, the oil company, did try to use robotic submarines to nudge the BOP but the effort was futile and a second BOP could, if it fails, trigger more oil spill. Recently, the US president opened more than 500,000 square miles of coastal waters in his country for oil exploration. This accident has put that decision on hold. White House adviser David Axelrod said \"No additional drilling has been authorised and none will until we find out what happened here and whether there was something unique and preventable here,\" And, the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, even in the midst of a budget crisis, ended his support for oil expansion, while Sarah Palin was still seen sticking to the slogan 'drill baby drill'. Right now BP is definitely Right now BP is definitely 'Beyond Petroleum' as it tries to stem the oil vent. Without entering into a fault finding mission, suffice to say, BP is in a terribly hot soup. Tony Hayward, chief executive of BP said \"We will absolutely be paying for the clean-up operation. There is no doubt about that. It's our responsibility, we accept it fully.\" Last week, BP was successful in stopping one of the three leaks from the MC252 oil well. However, in a private briefing with congress members, BP is said to have admitted that the spill could touch 40,000 barrels a day if the flow continues. At present, the spill is spewing about 5,000 barrels of oil a day. At stake are environmentally sensitive areas across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, livelihood of many people in the area and the wildlife with many species of fish, birds and mammals. For its part, BP finds itself in the same position as David Cameroon was for Avatar, the first to do something without a precedent to follow. But unlike Cameroon, BP has to contend with many more variables- public anger, finding new ways to seal the flow, massive influx of funds running to billions of dollars, and plummeting stock value are just some of them. It is uncertain how long it will take to control the leak with current means used. The technical challenges to stopping this leak with classical means are... namely a lack of classical means. Leaks at that depth rarely occurred before. Human divers can't go that deep. The technology used for leaks occurring in shallow water cannot be used here as the source of the leak lies more than a mile below the water. High-tech, experimental dome... but will it work? BP has installed floating booms in the sea and along the coastline to check the oil spill using local fishermen in a program called Vessels of Opportunity. These booms are also used to catch the spills which are then subjected to burning. The plan is to remove the residue of the burn using net and simmers. The company has deployed more than 700,000 feet of the boom with another million feet available for use. Still, boom or sandbags do not work, albeit as a temporary reassurance, as winds damage the booms rendering them useless. BP has also given $25 million block grants to the states affected by the oil spill- Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida. The company says the funds were disbursed to implement the Contingency Plans (ACPs) to prevent the spill affecting 'sensitive areas' BP has installed floating booms in the sea and along the coastline to check the oil spill using local fishermen in a program called Vessels of Opportunity.

The United States has about 5,113 nuclear war heads, as revealed by Pentagon according to the Strategic Arms Reduction purpose. So, why not use them for peaceful purpose for once? \"We are continuing to do all we can to stop the flow of oil from the well and also attack and capture the spilled oil offshore,\" said Tony Hayward. \"However, it is also vital that we work together with government and potentially impacted communities to protect the shoreline from any impact of the spill.

There he was briefed at a Coast Guard command center, spoke to five fishermen and got an aerial view of the coastline.\n\nSpeaking briefly in driving rain, Obama called it a \"massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster\" that could take many days to stop. He said the priorities are to plug the spill and protect the estuaries.\n\nIt was the first time since the April 20 explosion of a BP oil drilling platform that Obama devoted a full day to the gusher. Aides worked to prevent comparisons to President George W. Bush's response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which damaged Bush's presidency.\n\n\"This has been all hands on deck across the federal government, with the states,\" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said on Fox News Sunday.\n\nObama was briefed on Air Force One on his way to New Orleans by homeland security adviser John Brennan and environmental adviser Carol Browner.\n\nUpon arrival, he huddled on a rainy tarmac with Louisiana's Republican governor, Bobby Jindal, before the two-hour drive to Venice.\n\nWaiting for him there were environmental activists such as Michael Gravitz of Environment America, who said the risk of an oil spill should have been recognized earlier.\n\n\"The administration didn't cause this thing, but after a while, people will look at them and say, 'Where are the results?' \" Gravitz said.\n\nNapolitano, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen fanned out on the Sunday news shows to defend the administration's response.\n\nThey said 70 vessels and 1 million feet of boom to collect oil were prepositioned, a command center quickly set up and efforts made to coordinate with state and local officials.\n\n\"From day one, we've been on top of this every minute, 24 hours a day, trying to get the situation under control,\" Salazar said on Fox.\n\nSen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., said the administration still could do better. \"The federal government has leaned forward since day one,\" she said on CBS' Face the Nation, \"but obviously it's not enough.\"",

At least half of the group's 19 board of directors have direct ties to the offshore drilling industry, and one of them is currently an executive at Transocean, the company that owned the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded in the Gulf, causing the spill.

            "text": "The Deepwater Horizon, an oil drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico, exploded on April 20, 2010 resulting in the immediate loss of human life and in oil spilling out into the Gulf of Mexico. Estimates varied as to just how much oil spilled into the Gulf as well as the potential impacts this disaster would have on the people and habitats of this region. As of August 2010, a Washington Post article stated that approximately 205.8 million gallons were spilled. President Obama called the spill \"a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster.\"\n\n\n\nThe terms oil sheen, plumes and tar balls entered the news as the oil began polluting coastal ecosystems within five states. Fishing grounds closed and fleets of fishermen turned to the oil recovery effort to generate income. The term loop current also became commonly used as newscast audiences were warned that these ocean currents could carry the oil away from the northern Gulf of Mexico, south to the Florida Keys and then out into the Atlantic.\n\n\n\nThe Deepwater Horizon was not the first major oil spill, but it was one more in a series of such disastrous worldwide events. The Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, for example, remains one of the most tragic environmental disasters in U.S. history with an estimated 11 million gallons of oil spilled into the Alaskan waters. There have been many other spills worldwide. In 1979, the Mexican Ixtoc I oil spill released over 100 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. In 1991, millions of gallons of oil were released into the Persian Gulf by Iraqi forces determined to slow the advance of U.S. forces into Kuwait. And in Nigeria, oil spills are very common due to an aging infrastructure, spillage, and sabotage. \n\n\n\nThe world consumes an average of 85 million barrels of oil per day, with the United States accounting for close to 20 million barrels. The demand for oil has led to drilling in increasingly challenging locations. Off-shore rigs, like Deepwater Horizon, drill deeper wells than ever before. Another rig in the Gulf of Mexico named \"Perdido\" can pump oil from multiple wells almost two miles below the surface while drilling for new ones.\n\n\n\nOn September 19, 2010 US Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen declared that the Deepwater Horizon well was \"essentially dead\", sealed by flooding cement into the gap between the well casing and the rock formation that surrounds it. Researchers are interested in how much oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico, how much of the oil from the spill was recovered, where the remaining oil is located and how will it impact the environment. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill will be studied for years to come.\n\n\n\nNow that the well appears to have been permanently capped, your team of interns has been asked to brief a panel of U.S. government agencies on the long term Earth system consequences to the Gulf region. Basic \n\nIn October 2010, various agencies were suggesting that most of the oil had disappeared or that it had been collected. They were of the opinion that impacts to the Gulf had been eliminated or mitigated. Others said that just because the oil was not visibly present, it is still there, and that the full impacts from the spill cannot yet be measured. Your team has been asked by a congressional committee to provide predictions of the long-term impacts based on an Earth system science analysis. The committee also suggested you consider the impact of the Exxon Valdez and whether lessons from that disaster might be applied to this situation.\n\n\n\n Comprehensive \n\nThe U.S. Government immediately imposed a moratorium on Gulf Oil drilling as it looked at safety issues regarding underwater drilling. Now many are calling for an end to plans for such drilling in the Arctic. Those concerned say a comparable spill in the Arctic would be catastrophic and predict that drilling is certain to gain momentum as the ice melts in the Arctic region. Based on your expertise gained from analyzing the Gulf Oil Spill, the EPA panel concerned with the Arctic drilling issue wants your recommendations.\n\n\n\n On 20 April 2010, while drilling at the Macondo Prospect, an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig killed 11 crewmen and lit a fireball visible from 35 miles (56 km) away.

            "text": "I mean, come on -- it's not like it's the biggest oil spill ever or anything. It's not even the second biggest! And right now, it hasn't even caused as much devastation as the Exxon Valdez spill yet. So why are we even covering this thing again?Well, I've found a new pet peeve -- drastic, borderline-misleading reporting that understates the magnitude of a hands-down environmental disaster. I've taken issue with John Broder's work before (when he helped perpetrate the popular conservative myth that Al Gore hypes global warming to cash in on green investments, in what should be considered the weirdest get-rich-quick scheme in history, if it were real). And in a bit of news analysis for the New York Times, he downplays the severity of what is likely to be the biggest environmental catastrophe in the US in decades. It's not as though this is particularly egregious, just baffling -- it's a trend that Climate Progress has noted; various outlets misreporting the severity of the Gulf oil event.\n\nPresident Obama has called the spill \"a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster.\" And some scientists have suggested that the oil might hitch a ride on the loop current in the gulf, bringing havoc to the Atlantic Coast. Yet the Deepwater Horizon blowout is not unprecedented, nor is it yet among the worst oil accidents in history. And its ultimate impact will depend on a long list of interlinked variables, including the weather, ocean currents, the properties of the oil involved and the success or failure of the frantic efforts to stanch the flow and remediate its effects. As one expert put it, this is the first inning of a nine-inning game. No one knows the final score.\n\nHe goes on, somewhat bizarrely, to repeat the standard boilerplate that it's not nearly as bad as the worst accidents in history, so maybe people are overreacting. Column space is dedicated not to probing the actual impacts this veritable volcano of oil could have on wildlife, the economy around the Gulf, and so on -- had he done that, he may have found that in many regards, this disaster is unprecedented. The marshlands, the ones that provide the coast with its first line of defense against storms, are threatened by the spill have never been so fragile, so vulnerable before. Bluefin Tuna has never been so endangered. The fish populations never so overfished. We've never had the capacity to prevent such leaks from happening with good tech before (this was a new rig!).\n\nWe may not know the final score yet, but there is unquestionably going to be serious devastation to ecosystems -- and just because the game isn't over, doesn't mean we should be concerned about the toll.\n\nAnd while this story may not boast the arc of pristine \"untouched\" wilderness getting threatened by oil that the Valdez did, it's still absolutely, undoubtedly going to be devastating in certain ways regardless of whether the leak is plugged tomorrow, or the slick never reaches land (both of which are near impossibilities). Marine mammals populations will be damaged, plankton will die off in droves, causing fish, crabs, and shrimp to suffer, oyster reefs will suffer, birds will perish, and so on. Some of these effects will have an impact on wildlife -- and the people whose livelihoods depend on it -- for generations to come.\n\nSo when you see these kind of stories, that dismiss the magnitude of this disaster, keep this in mind: this oil spill is a really, really big deal. There's no excuse for defending an event, caused in part by negligence, that wreaks this kind of havoc on ecosystems on the grounds that it's not up to scale.\n\nMore on the Gulf Oil Spill:\n\nThe 7 Stupidest Statements Made About the BP Gulf Oil Spill ...\n\nGulf of Mexico Oil Spill : The What, When and Where",

mexico the massive environmental disaster unfolding in the gulf of mexico — oil gushing uncontrolled from a damaged well — threatens to compound a different problem that originates 1200 miles north of the gulf in minnesota the gulfs socalled dead zone caused by nitrogen runoff along the banks of the mississippi river already was suffocating oysters clams and other sea creatures during the summer months now the growing oil slick could exacerbate that problem by further depleting oxygen that is vital to a myriad of marine life forms said john gulliver a civil and environmental engineer who conducts research at the university of minnesotas st anthony falls laboratory in minneapolis timing will be a key and time does not appear to be on the side of those working to avert the union of the two manmade assaults on life in the gulfs waters an explosion at the deepwater horizon floating rig on april 20 killed 11 workers and damaged pipes are bleeding more than 200000 gallons of oil a day into the gulfs waters it will be at least a week and possibly as long as three months before the wells spurting oil deep below the gulfs surface is contained tony hayward chief executive of the oil giant bp said monday on nbcs today show the difference depends on whether temporary fixes work in the short term to stem the flow until bp can drill a relief well to control the oil on the gulfs floor haywards worstcasescenario — that it would take up to three months to control the gusher — could extend this crisis into summer when it would compound the effects of the dead zone flowing from the heartland in the gulfs dead zone oxygen is severely depleted during warm summer months literally suffocating life in an area roughly the size of massachusetts the problem originates in minnesota where the mississippi river begins to drain the nations agricultural heartland the river picks up nitrogen and phosphorus used to fertilize fields — and urban lawns too concentrations of the chemicals grow as the river flows past iowa illinois and points south once the chemicals reach the gulf they stimulate an unnatural super bloom of algae the algae die and sink to the bottom where bacteria decompose them and the bacteria suck up oxygen leaving the water in a state known as hypoxia — which means there is inadequate oxygen to support living cells how stuff works offers a video of the process here other subtle factors contribute to the oxygen depletion such as the layering of fresh and salt water as the mississippi enters the gulf there is nothing subtle about the results lobsters oysters and other slowmoving creatures are trapped and die even fish that flee for their lives suffer side effects such as shrunken reproductive organs and problems in spawning reutersus coast guard fire boat response crews battled the blazing remnants of the off shore oil rig deepwater horizon in this photo taken on april 21 years before the explosion on the deepwater horizon rig the dead zone was pitting the gulfs 28 billion a year fishing industry against the economic and political interests of mighty agriculture in the upper midwest a serious setback minnesota organizations from the department of natural resources to the science museum of minnesota have contributed over the years to efforts to coax northerners along the mississippi to take responsibility for their own runoff they called upon farmers in particular to pitch into efforts to shrink the dead zone in 2008 a consortium of government agencies called the mississippi river gulf of mexico watershed nutrient task force set out goals for significantly reducing the zone its average size over the past five years was 6000 square miles the interagency task force proposed to shrink it to 2000 square miles by 2015 last year the zone was smaller than expected but it was more severe extending closer to the surface than in previous years according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration now the efforts to shrink it face a serious setback oil gushing into the gulf could further starve the water for oxygen said gulliver the environmental engineer in minneapolis john gulliver oil is a source of carbon which like nitrogen can give rise to more oxygenusing organisms in the water the carbon effect may not be as significant but it would add to a problem that already is lethal for sea life in the gulf gulliver said further the oil slick on the gulfs surface can slow down the process by which oxygen is transferred from the atmosphere to the water he said the upshot is that the beleaguered gulf region faces a double whammy of disasters this summer the dead zone diminishes in winter because the algae need warm temperatures and ample sunshine to flourish gulliver said so the timing may not be right now he said but the danger mounts as the days wear on lucky on land but not at sea gulf coast residents counted themselves lucky monday as winds drove the swelling oil slick away from shore sparing the contamination of beaches shipping ports and fragile coastal marshes not so lucky were sea creatures from endangered turtles to schools of newly hatched fish that are caught in the slick estimated by reuters to measure at least 130 miles by 70 miles even if the well is brought under control next week the critical question for life at sea is how long it will take to clean up the millions of gallons of crude oil that already are in the water there is reason to hope for relief there too the new york times said today engineers said the type of oil pouring out is lighter than the heavy crude spilled by the exxon valdez accident in alaska in 1989 evaporates more quickly and is easier to burn the oil in the gulf also appears to respond to the use of dispersants which break up globs of oil and help them sink the times said still the oil is capable of significant damage particularly when it is churned up with water and forms a sort of mousse that floats and can travel long distances it said come midsummer whats left of that slick is almost sure to overlap with the dead zone — which can shift to and fro in the gulf gulliver said no one knows the full measure of the damage such a grim union could cause when it comes to environmental problems one plus one doesnt always add up to two the sum can be much larger as combinations of factors give rise to new problems taking samples near the spill meanwhile noaa closed more than 6800 square miles of federal fishing areas from the mouth of the mississippi to floridas pensacola bay the associated press reported on monday noaa administrator

with a series of lies and halftruths dismissing some experts who predict apocalypse authors john broder and tom zeller declare that the deepwater horizon blowout is not unprecedented nor is it yet among the worst oil accidents in history in the times estimation whether or not it achieves historic status will depend on a long list of interlinked variables with millions of gallons of oil spilled near a densley populated and economically crucial area the deepwater horizon disaster is already among the worst oil spills in history the times long list of interlinked variables notwithstanding what remains to be seen—and this depends ultimately on stopping the spill at its source one mile beneath the waters surface—is where the bp spill will rank among the worst ecological catastrophes in human history it is this extraordinary depth that does indeed make the the deepwater horizon spill unprecedented—and what makes stemming the gushing of oil near the seabed in the gulf of mexicos mississippi canyon so difficult this aspect of the spill is the direct consequence of the obama and bush administrations promotion of deep sea oil drilling the times goal is not to clarify the origins and scope of the disaster but to sedate and confuse its readership this the article attempts to do by offering distorted comparisons to other spills bps deepwater horizon spill according to broder and zeller could flow for years and still not begin to approach the 36 billion gallons of oil spilled by retreating iraqi forces when they left kuwait in 1991 emphasis added this statistic is an outandout fabrication based on claims made during the first gulf war that iraqi soldiers—who us missiles killed by the thousands as they retreated from kuwait—had first sabotaged kuwaiti oil wells questioned by the world socialist web sit e broder said the statistic is located on the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa web site a search of the site reveals a 1991 report from the national oceanic service claiming that the iraqi military had dumped 900000000 barrels of oil into the persian gulf both the story and the statistic have since been discredited as broder who refused further comment is no doubt aware according to a 1993 study commissioned by the intergovernmental oceanographic commission at unesco and several persian gulf nations about 330 million gallons spilled resulting in few unequivocal oil pollution effects attributable solely to the 1991 oil spills later estimates put the figure between 40 million and 63 million gallons about 01 percent of the times claim the times also complacently declares that deepwater horizon will have to get much worse before it approaches the impact of the exxon valdez accident of 1989 in fact by many scientific estimates the current spill may have already surpassed the valdez ian macdonald an oceanographer at florida state university estimated that already by april 28 nearly 9 million gallons had been released skytruth a nonprofit environmental analysis firm put the figure at 122 million gallons by sunday broder and zeller simply ignore these and other widely reported estimates yet even the lowend estimate put forth by the us coast guard of 210000 gallons daily would mean that 3 million gallons have so far been dumped—with no indication that the hemmhoraging can be slowed before the disater approaches or surpasses the valdez spill which poured nearl 11 million gallons into alaskas prince william sound in 1989 after minimizing the spill the times concludes on an incongruous note arguing that the gulf of mexico is already polluted—so really why worry about a few million more gallons of oil the gulf is not a pristine environment and has survived both chronic and acute pollution problems before broder and zeller write thousands of gallons of oil flow into the gulf from natural undersea well seeps every day engineers say and the scores of refineries and chemical plants that line the shore from mexico to mississippi pour untold volumes of pollutants into the water by the same logic one might argue that because people produce carbon dioxide when they breathe there is no point in worrying about atmospheric pollution the times dresses up all of this obfuscation as objective journalism according to broder and zeller no one not even the oil industrys most fervent apologists is making

            "text": "The April 20 blowout on a BP oil rig 50 miles off Louisiana’s coast, which claimed the lives of 11 workers, continues to gush millions of gallons of heavy crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico with no clear end in sight. The disaster has already led to major economic and environmental devastation, with the Gulf Coast’s multi-billion-dollar fishing industry suspended in high season.\n\nWith the calamity resulting from the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon growing worse by the day, the New York Times, the leading publication of US liberalism and self-styled “newspaper of record,” declares in a Tuesday “news analysis” that the spill is really not so serious after all. The column, “Gulf Oil Spill Is Bad, but How Bad?” is a thoroughly dishonest piece whose clear aim is to chloroform mounting public anger against BP and the Obama administration.\n\nThe Times starts its column with a series of lies and half-truths. Dismissing “some experts” who “predict apocalypse,” authors John Broder and Tom Zeller declare that the “Deepwater Horizon blowout is not unprecedented, nor is it yet among the worst oil accidents in history.” In the Times’ estimation, whether or not it achieves historic status “will depend on a long list of interlinked variables.”\n\nWith millions of gallons of oil spilled near a densley populated and economically crucial area, the Deepwater Horizon disaster is already among the worst oil spills in history, the Times’ “long list of interlinked variables” notwithstanding.\n\nWhat remains to be seen—and this depends ultimately on stopping the spill at its source one mile beneath the water’s surface—is where the BP spill will rank among the worst ecological catastrophes in human history. It is this extraordinary depth that does, indeed, make the the Deepwater Horizon spill “unprecedented”—and what makes stemming the gushing of oil near the seabed in the Gulf of Mexico’s Mississippi Canyon so difficult. This aspect of the spill is the direct consequence of the Obama and Bush administrations’ promotion of deep sea oil drilling.\n\nThe Times’ goal is not to clarify the origins and scope of the disaster, but to sedate and confuse its readership. This the article attempts to do by offering distorted comparisons to other spills.\n\nBP’s Deepwater Horizon spill, according to Broder and Zeller, “could flow for years and still not begin to approach the 36 billion gallons of oil spilled by retreating Iraqi forces when they left Kuwait in 1991” (emphasis added). This statistic is an out-and-out fabrication based on claims made during the first Gulf War that Iraqi soldiers—who US missiles killed by the thousands as they retreated from Kuwait—had first sabotaged Kuwaiti oil wells.\n\nQuestioned by the World Socialist Web Site, Broder said the statistic is located on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) web site. A search of the site reveals a 1991 report from the National Oceanic Service claiming that the Iraqi military had dumped 900,000,000 barrels of oil into the Persian Gulf. Both the story and the statistic have since been discredited as Broder, who refused further comment, is no doubt aware. According to a 1993 study, commissioned by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission at UNESCO and several Persian Gulf nations, about 330 million gallons spilled, resulting in “few unequivocal oil pollution effects attributable solely to the 1991 oil spills.” Later estimates put the figure between 40 million and 63 million gallons, about 0.1 percent of the Times’ claim.\n\nThe Times also complacently declares that Deepwater Horizon “will have to get much worse before it approaches the impact of the Exxon Valdez accident of 1989.” In fact, by many scientific estimates the current spill may have already surpassed the Valdez.\n\nIan MacDonald, an oceanographer at Florida State University, estimated that already by April 28, nearly 9 million gallons had been released. SkyTruth, a non-profit environmental analysis firm, put the figure at 12.2 million gallons by Sunday.\n\nBroder and Zeller simply ignore these and other widely reported estimates. Yet even the low-end estimate put forth by the US Coast Guard of 210,000 gallons daily would mean that 3 million gallons have so far been dumped—with no indication that the hemmhoraging can be slowed before the disater approaches or surpasses the Valdez spill, which poured nearl 11 million gallons into Alaska’s Prince William Sound in 1989.\n\nAfter minimizing the spill, the Times concludes on an incongruous note, arguing that the Gulf of Mexico is already polluted—so really, why worry about a few million more gallons of oil.\n\n“The gulf is not a pristine environment and has survived both chronic and acute pollution problems before,” Broder and Zeller write. “Thousands of gallons of oil flow into the gulf from natural undersea well seeps every day, engineers say, and the scores of refineries and chemical plants that line the shore from Mexico to Mississippi pour untold volumes of pollutants into the water.” By the same logic, one might argue that because people produce carbon dioxide when they breathe, there is no point in worrying about atmospheric pollution!\n\nThe Times dresses up all of this obfuscation as objective journalism. According to Broder and Zeller, “No one, not even the oil industry’s most fervent apologists, is making light of this accident.” No one—except of course the New York Times!\n\nTuesday’s “news analysis” continues the Times’ miserable record on the Deepwater Horizon explosion and deep sea drilling more generally.\n\nScientists and environmentalists have warned for years that a blowout was likely on a deep sea oil rig—which would present enormous difficulties to stop. But the media failed to widely report these warnings.\n\nEven after the April 20 explosion, the media, led by the Times, dutifully parroted assurances from BP and the Obama administration that there was no oil spill. Like Obama, the media has largely ignored the workers killed and the families left behind in the blast. While the Times of London managed an article listing the names of those killed, the Times of New York has not.\n\nOn the other hand, the New York Times sprang to the defense of deep sea oil drilling. The only real concern it raised in a April 23 editorial, “Explosion in the Gulf,” was that the accident could provide “new fodder” to drilling’s opponents. “The explosion occurred just weeks after President Obama decided to open parts of America’s coastal waters to exploratory drilling,” the Times wrote, referring to Obama’s call to lift moratoriums on drilling off the Atlantic Coast, Florida’s Gulf Coast, and northern Alaskan water. “This tragedy is not reason enough to reverse that decision.”\n\nThe newspaper’s first aim is to defend the Obama administration, whose indifference to the explosion and spill has generated widespread anger—and many comparisons to the Bush administration’s response to Hurricane Katrina, which ravaged the Gulf Coast in 2005.\n\nBehind this is a more fundamental concern. The BP oil spill is bringing millions of people face to face with the essence of capitalism—the subordination of everything, including the very survival of the planet—to the destructive profit drive of the corporate and financial elite. The New York Times, a long-serving organ of this elite, seeks to forestall this dawning awareness.",

            "text": "Mother Lode is a family-style board game for two to four players, either human or computer.\n\nPlayers control miners on the surface of a mineral-rich planet.  The planet is unfortunately breaking apart and will soon explode.  Your miners must escape while collecting as much ore as possible in the process.\n\nMother Lode is inspired by an old Parker Brothers board game called Survive! – one of my favorites as a kid.  This isn’t just a straight port, though.  In addition to the change to a space theme, Mother Lode has many other differences to separate it from its roots.\n\nEvery turn your miners remain on the planet they will try to mine for ore. Different land types have different chances of success. Each miner can carry up to two more units of ore above their starting amount. It is only this additional amount that is shown to other players. The starting value is hidden until the end of the game when points are tallied.\n\nLand tiles are flipped every turn and actions are taken based on what’s underneath. There are fourteen actions available in the game. Some help you directly (boost escape pod, move miner into pod). Others you can choose whether to help yourself or hinder your opponents (warp pirate, squid stalks escape pod). A few make life interesting for all players (new creature, add escape pod, open wormhole).\n\nHow you use these abilities and adapt to the game circumstances will determine your success.\n\nBecause Mother Lode supports up to four players simultaneously, it is important for players to have a way to view their own information without showing it to opponents. This is accomplished through the player areas in each corner of the board. By holding a touch in this area a player can use their hand to shield their action tiles and miner information from prying eyes. As soon as they release the touch this data immediately becomes hidden again. Multiple players can be doing this at once – even while the current player is taking their turn on the main board!\n\nPlayers earn points for miners rescued along with the ore they are carrying. No one knows the final score until all miner values are revealed. Who will escape with the Mother Lode?",

            "text": "Described as a “potentially unprecedented” environmental disaster by the President of the United States, the explosion of (and subsequent oil leak from) one of oil giant BP's rigs in the Gulf of Mexico on April 22nd has seen the brand's 'Impression' and 'Buzz' scores on BrandIndex plummet.\n\nBrandIndex's Impression score measures whether people have a 'generally positive' or 'generally negative' feeling towards a certain brand – and BP's score has fallen into the negative for the first time since January 2009. The drop, from a positive score of 5 on April 29th to almost -3 in recent days, shows the gathering negative public sentiment towards the company in response to the incident.\n\nBrandIndex's 'Buzz' score, on the other hand, measures whether people have heard anything positive or negative about a certain brand and subtracts negative sentiments from positive ones to get a net score. Again, BP's 'Buzz' has fallen from -9 on the day of the explosion to the latest figure of -21, just as news continues to break about the consequences of the spill, which seem to be getting progressively worse as it nears the American coast.\n\nFor its part, BP has claimed all responsibility for the cleanup bill, and is planning on placing a 98-ton iron funnel over the leak at the sea floor in an attempt to prevent the oil flowing into the Gulf of Mexico. This is taking place alongside parallel widespread efforts to minimise the impact of the oil slick on the sea's surface and ecosystem, in order to prevent the rapid worsening of an environmental disaster which has already been likened to Hurricane Katrina, the massive storm that devastated the state of Louisiana in 2005. It is perhaps this acceptance of accountability that has spared BP's 'Reputation' score (calculated by asking people if they would be ashamed or proud to work for the company) from seeing similar drops to the other measures – since the rig explosion, reputation has increased from 12.5 to 14.\n\nBP still insists that the rig's contractor, Transocean, is to blame for the original explosion, but it seems that this attempt to divert the spotlight from itself has done little to help the public's general impression of the event. Despite considerable efforts from BP to contain the impact of the potential tragedy, its share prices have also fallen since the incident, by a sizeable 15%. The company's BrandIndex 'Buzz' and 'Impression' scores have mirrored this drop, and while these could arguably slide even further as the scale of the disaster fully comes to light, BP's continuing pledge to clean up the slick may yet see its overall reputation emerge unscathed among the British public.",

throes of a fullblown oil spill with crude spewing from three uncontrolled leaks they immediately took action using remotecontrolled submersible robots they worked to repair the failed blowout preventer but to no avail bp then resorted to a trio of techniques to impede the oil from reaching american coastlines—spraying the surface with chemical dispersant to break up slicks burning off the oil and laying millions of feet of boom floating tubes meant to protect the shoreline by holding the light crude at bay yet none of these procedures stopped what is at least 5000 barrels per day from spilling into the gulf after days of work bp announced it had finally closed off the smallest leak using a specially designed valve the move however did not really slow the flow of oil according to experts the only surefire way to stop the main spill is to drill a relief well boring out a new well to intersect with the original seveninch hole so that both can be capped and controlled this complicated procedure will take at least 90 days from start to finish in the meantime bp looked for other fixes first was the cofferdam—a fourstoryhigh box designed to rest on top of the spill so the oil inside could be pumped to the surface but it rested uselessly on the ocean floor after it clogged with a slushy mixture of frozen hydrocarbons and water then came the top hat a smaller version of the cofferdam which was scheduled to be followed by the junk shot—filling the hole with debris in an attempt to stop the flow but each idea is met with deep sea obstacles namely frigid temperatures and powerful currents and each time a new tactic is employed bp executives remind everyone that this has never been tried before these containment attempts were eventually cast aside for the insertion tube—meant to slow the flow by inserting into the pipe what is essentially an industrialsized catheter near the main leak to siphon off much of the oil the insertion tool is now in operation sucking up about 2400 gallons per hour many are concerned that the cleanup measures will devastate gulf wildlife this is the first spill in which chemical dispersants have been widely used—840000 gallons since april 20 the dispersant breaks up the oil and sinks globules to the ocean floor which could potentially wreak havoc on the underwater ecosystem scientists do not know the longterm impact of the chemicals the gulf is tremendously resilient marine biologist quenton r dokken told the new york times but weve always got to ask ourselves how long can we keep heaping these insults on the gulf and having it bounce back as a scientist i have to say i just dont know and the oil spill may be worse than official estimates the times reported in a closeddoor briefing for members of congress a senior bp executive concededthat the ruptured oil well could conceivably spill as much as 60000 barrels a day of oil more than 10 times the estimate of the current flow additionally much of the oil may be in underwater plumes unseen by coast guard flyovers or in satellite images theres an equal amount that could be subsurface too university of california berkeley professor robert bea who worked for shell oil co in the 1960s during the last big northern gulf of mexico oil well blowout told the associated press oil below the surface he continued is near impossible to track the american experiment the gulf oil spill has similarities to many of americas current problems it is on a scale never seen before requires solutions that have never been tested and all under conditions that are anything but ideal with the oil spill and many other crises taxing the nation the us has entered a new phase of the great american experiment having to implement neverbeforetried solutions yet the nation stands ready to tackle the problems as it always has—headon even with compounding american crises most everyone remains confident the nation is everresilient more than able to weather these hard times and why shouldnt the country confidently face daunting tasks for two centuries the united states along with britain has had the greatest army been the world leader in agriculture manufacturing production technology and trade and held crucial strategic sea gates and defensive strongholds throughout the world and throughout this time the nation has repeatedly been given challenges—the civil war world war i and world war ii the great depression—and has almost always emerged victorious but why most look to the founding fathers as the source of this nations greatness either citing the unique political ideology set down in the constitution as the backbone of the countrys success or believing that the nation was founded on strong judeochristian roots and that strong faith in god has guided the nation to preeminence the answer does in fact come from the lives of the fathers of the american people—but not in the way most think abraham the father of the descendants of the ancient nation of israel was given a promise from god for his obedience that in blessing i will bless you and in multiplying i will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and your seed shall possess the gate sea gates of his enemies and in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because you have obeyed my voice gen 221718 the same promise was passed to abrahams son isaac and later to jacob therefore god give you of the dew of heaven and the fertile places of the earth and plenty of corn and wine gen 2728 jacob was later renamed israel and the promise was expounded on by god be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of you gen 3511 who fits this description certainly not the tiny slave nation of ancient israel or the modern state of israel on the mediterranean when all these specific details are aligned only two countries emerge america a nation and the united kingdom a company of nations because of the promises made to these true founding fathers alone america has enjoyed abundance during its meteoric rise to prominence nation in decline in contrast to modern thinking america did not achieve its superpower status through sheer human effort yet with the unconditional promise of abraham fulfilled the blessings america has long enjoyed are being withdrawn so what changed the people of the united states have been ungrateful for their blessings—feeling they are the product of a manmade political system or unalienable rights conferred on them by god americas rise however was only due to one thing—abrahams obedience notice why god promised to bless abrahams offspring in the first place because you have obeyed my voice only through obedience to gods laws can the united states return to superpower status what then is one of americas greatest offenses covetousness for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness and from the prophet even unto the priest every one deals falsely jer 613 current world events make obvious the consequences of us disobedience old allies of america are turning their backs on the nation thus says the lord god

            "text": "The Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig exploding, catching fire and sinking 5,000 feet to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico was extremely bad news. The pipe, cracked in three places, continues to spew oil, mixed with bubbles of methane gas and sediment, already leaving at least 6 million gallons of oil in the ocean.\n\nThis is bad news for the environment. Miles-long oil slicks are washing ashore from Florida to Texas—coastlines that are essential nesting grounds for loggerhead and green sea turtles. Offshore, countless species of fish, jellyfish and crabs are laying eggs at sea amid the rust-colored swirls of light crude. Also, tides of brown muck coat many acres of pristine Louisiana wetlands. The oil could remain in the plant life and soil for years, possibly destroying the fragile ecosystem.\n\nThis is also bad news for the coastal economy. The spill came just after hope seemed to reappear for Gulf Coast states. But as the rig went up in flames, which could be seen 50 miles away on Louisiana beaches, so did the renewed dreams of many in the region. The oil spill is crippling the fishing industry, as contaminated fish and shrimp are unsellable. While hotel occupancy is up 4 percent in Florida over last year, oil-tainted beaches—or even fear of oil ruining a vacation—may erase these gains.\n\nWorse, it is more bad news for America.\n\nAs the oil spill worsened, updates from the Gulf had stiff competition for nightly television news air time: Nashville, Tennessee, was inundated with rain, with water levels reaching 12 feet above flood stage—30 dead. A botched Times Square bomb attack confirmed homegrown terror is alive and well. Arizona’s illegal immigration legislation aggravated racial tensions to the brink of violence. Add to these the ongoing economic woes, 9.9 percent unemployment and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nClearly, America faces many serious problems. Why yet another disaster?\n\nWhen energy giant BP, which owns the leaking well, and the U.S. Coast Guard realized they were in the throes of a full-blown oil spill, with crude spewing from three uncontrolled leaks, they immediately took action. Using remote-controlled submersible robots, they worked to repair the failed blow-out preventer, but to no avail. BP then resorted to a trio of techniques to impede the oil from reaching American coastlines—spraying the surface with chemical dispersant to break up slicks, burning off the oil and laying millions of feet of boom, floating tubes meant to protect the shoreline by holding the light crude at bay.\n\nYet none of these procedures stopped what is at least 5,000 barrels per day from spilling into the Gulf.\n\nAfter days of work, BP announced it had finally closed off the smallest leak using a specially designed valve. The move, however, did not really slow the flow of oil.\n\nAccording to experts, the only surefire way to stop the main spill is to drill a relief well, boring out a new well to intersect with the original seven-inch hole so that both can be capped and controlled. This complicated procedure will take at least 90 days from start to finish.\n\nIn the meantime, BP looked for other fixes. First was the “cofferdam”—a four-story-high box designed to rest on top of the spill so the oil inside could be pumped to the surface. But it rested uselessly on the ocean floor after it clogged with a slushy mixture of frozen hydrocarbons and water. Then came the “top hat,” a smaller version of the cofferdam, which was scheduled to be followed by the “junk shot”—filling the hole with debris in an attempt to stop the flow.\n\nBut each idea is met with deep sea obstacles, namely frigid temperatures and powerful currents. And each time a new tactic is employed, BP executives remind everyone that “this has never been tried before.”\n\nThese containment attempts were eventually cast aside for the “insertion tube”—meant to slow the flow by inserting into the pipe what is essentially an industrial-sized catheter near the main leak to siphon off much of the oil. The insertion tool is now in operation, sucking up about 2,400 gallons per hour.\n\nMany are concerned that the cleanup measures will devastate Gulf wildlife. This is the first spill in which chemical dispersants have been widely used—840,000 gallons since April 20. The dispersant breaks up the oil and sinks globules to the ocean floor, which could potentially wreak havoc on the underwater ecosystem. Scientists do not know the long-term impact of the chemicals.\n\n“The gulf is tremendously resilient,” marine biologist Quenton R. Dokken told The New York Times. “But we’ve always got to ask ourselves how long can we keep heaping these insults on the gulf and having it bounce back. As a scientist, I have to say I just don’t know.”\n\nAnd the oil spill may be worse than official estimates. The Times reported, “In a closed-door briefing for members of Congress, a senior BP executive conceded…that the ruptured oil well could conceivably spill as much as 60,000 barrels a day of oil, more than 10 times the estimate of the current flow.”\n\nAdditionally, much of the oil may be in underwater plumes unseen by Coast Guard flyovers or in satellite images.\n\n“There’s an equal amount that could be subsurface too,” University of California Berkeley professor Robert Bea, who worked for Shell Oil Co. in the 1960s during the last big northern Gulf of Mexico oil well blowout told The Associated Press. Oil below the surface, he continued, is “near impossible to track.”\n\nThe Gulf oil spill has similarities to many of America’s current problems: it is on a scale never seen before, requires solutions that have never been tested, and all under conditions that are anything but ideal.\n\nWith the oil spill and many other crises taxing the nation, the U.S. has entered a new phase of the “Great American Experiment,” having to implement never-before-tried solutions. Yet the nation stands ready to tackle the problems as it always has—head-on.\n\nEven with compounding American crises, most everyone remains confident the nation is ever-resilient, more than able to weather these hard times.\n\nAnd why shouldn’t the country confidently face daunting tasks? For two centuries, the United States, along with Britain, has had the greatest army, been the world leader in agriculture, manufacturing, production, technology and trade, and held crucial strategic sea gates and defensive strongholds throughout the world. And throughout this time, the nation has repeatedly been given challenges—the Civil War, World War I and World War II, the Great Depression—and has almost always emerged victorious. But why?\n\nMost look to the founding fathers as the source of this nation’s greatness, either citing the unique political ideology set down in the Constitution as the backbone of the country’s success, or believing that the nation was founded on strong Judeo-Christian roots and that strong faith in God has guided the nation to preeminence.\n\nThe answer does in fact come from the lives of the fathers of the American people—but not in the way most think!\n\nAbraham, the father of the descendants of the ancient nation of Israel, was given a promise from God for his obedience.\n\n“That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate [sea gates] of his enemies; and in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because you have obeyed My voice” (Gen. 22:17-18).\n\nThe same promise was passed to Abraham’s son Isaac and later to Jacob: “Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the [fertile places] of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine” (Gen. 27:28).\n\nJacob was later renamed Israel, and the promise was expounded on by God: “…be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of you” (Gen. 35:11).\n\nWho fits this description? Certainly not the tiny slave nation of ancient Israel or the modern state of Israel on the Mediterranean! When all these specific details are aligned, only two countries emerge: America (a nation) and the United Kingdom (a company of nations).\n\nBecause of the promises made to these true “founding fathers” alone, America has enjoyed abundance during its meteoric rise to prominence.\n\nIn contrast to modern thinking, America did not achieve its superpower status through sheer human effort. Yet, with the unconditional promise of Abraham fulfilled, the blessings America has long enjoyed are being withdrawn.\n\nSo what changed? The people of the United States have been ungrateful for their blessings—feeling they are the product of a manmade political system or “unalienable rights” conferred on them by God.\n\nAmerica’s rise, however, was only due to one thing—Abraham’s obedience. Notice why God promised to bless Abraham’s offspring in the first place: “because you have obeyed My voice.” Only through obedience to God’s laws can the United States return to superpower status.\n\nWhat then is one of America’s greatest offenses? Covetousness. “For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one deals falsely” (Jer. 6:13).\n\nCurrent world events make obvious the consequences of U.S. disobedience:\n\nInstead of heeding the warnings of punishment from a loving God, Americans continue to believe that they can solve their problems. Yet the conditions of the nation—widespread unemployment—$12.9 trillion in national debt—two “unwinnable” wars on the other side of the globe—make a major Gulf oil spill pale in comparison. Instead of changing their lives, Americans think they can solve the current crises through physical means!\n\nRead carefully: “They have healed also the hurt of…My people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace” (Jer. 6:14). Today, much of American life still feels normal—peace, but when there is no peace—yet punishment looms unless the nation turns toward God in obedience.\n\nGod would never punish without offering a way of escape. Notice: “For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. For when they [leaders and religionists] shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes upon them…But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief” (I Thes. 5:2-4).\n\nIndividuals can know and respond to what is coming.

            "text": "Minute Menu HX is a comprehensive CACFP management system for Sponsors, designed both to radically reduce operating costs by automating virtually all aspects of a Sponsor's operation and to substantially improve program integrity by helping ensure federal and state policies are accurately and easily followed. It is used by about 300 sponsors in 40 states covering 85,000 family child care providers -- roughly 60% of the food program nationwide has chosen to use Minute Menu because the features it offers (and the support we provide our Sponsors) are without comparison. And it's used by Sponsors with anywhere from 20 family child care homes to 5,000 family child care homes. So regardless where you are, or how large your food program is, Minute Menu is for you! Minute Menu helps Sponsors manage all aspects of their operations, allowing detailed analysis and reporting on: Besides providing detailed management tools (with over 100 reports) in each of those areas, it also automates several key areas of your operation: The most useful automation tool that it provides is claim processing. Minute Menu HX will actually examine meal & attendance records for you, determine which meals are valid and which ones aren't, check a provider's capacity, make sure school aged children aren't claimed when they shouldn't be, ensure no child is claimed more than 2 meals & a snack (or 2 snacks & a meal)... it actually performs over 150 edit checks on every food, every child, every meal, every day. And from these edit checks, it produces a claim for each provider with Tier 1 & Tier 2 meal counts and a detailed error letter that the provider can review (in English or Spanish). What makes this possible is Minute Menu's automated data collection. Providers can submit claims via the Internet using our Minute Menu Kids system, they can submit claims on scannable forms (in several different formats), or they can submit traditional paper claims, and you can use Minute Menu to automate the processing of all these claims. It saves a tremendous amount of time. More importantly, it dramatically improves your program integrity: it is simply impossible for a human being to do all the checks the food program requires, accurately, on every claim. It's just too much work. When Minute Menu does it, it applies the same rules to every claim every time, so that you can be certain that your claims are being processed consistently. It virtually eliminates audit findings related to claim processing. Its the beginning of the month. You're preparing claims. Your Providers have been recording their meals each day with easy-to-use Internet software. You sit down in front of your computer. You point and click a few times. And you're done with your claim. Your state claim is prepared - summarizing Tier 1 and Tier 2 Hi, Lo, and Mixed Provider meal counts, with the exact detail required by your state. Provider meal counts and error reports are ready - including a reason for every disallowed meal to help train your Providers. Provider claim reimbursement checks are printed - with adjustments itemized on their check stubs. Direct deposits are made as well. What's even better, your employees are out in the field training Providers, not combing through paperwork! And you process this entire claim with the knowledge that you won't have any troubles when the auditors come. For more information, contact us and we can send you a full interest packet describing the software in detail. For CACFP management software for Sponsors look no further than Minute Menu Systems. We are your #1 source for childcare management software specializing in child and adult care management programs. Contact us today at (972) 671-5211 to learn how Minute Menu Systems can help with your CACFP software needs.\n\nMinute Menu HX gives you many options, so you can easily manage claims from ALL of your providers, whether they have a computer or not! Each Provider with access to the Internet will submit their claim on-line. If you choose to purchase a scanner (which is necessary with the Minute Menu HX Full license, but not the Lite license), then the remainder of your providers can submit claims on scannable forms which are then fed into a high speed NCS Pearson scanner for processing. Alternatively, you can enter claims by hand when they are submitted by Providers on hand-written meal & attendance forms. Regardless how a provider sends their claim to you, the Minute Menu HX Claims Processor will determine how much those Providers should be reimbursed. The system will issue error letters with details on any problems with nutrition, child enrollment or schedules, or any other area of their claim. The system even automatically checks for block claims -- and will automatically reschedule upcoming reviews to ensure you meet with the 60 day block claim follow up requirement! And that's really only the tip of the iceberg! For more information, contact us and we can send you a full interest packet describing the software in detail.\n\nWhen you choose Minute Menu, you get the best software system available for Food Program Sponsors. But you also get industry leading software for your child care providers to help them claim on-line and even help them with other areas of their child care business. Minute Menu Kids is a software that can either be run thru the Internet Explorer web browser or downloaded and installed on a provider's computer. It allows your providers to quickly and easily record their food program claims on-line, completely free. They can enroll children (sending you signed copies of those USDA enrollments, but dramatically reducing your time to deal with new enrollments), withdraw children, mark children as being served a meal, record daily in/out times (if you require that), record foods served, plan foods ahead of time, and submit their claims to you. They can even review claim errors after you process the claim, and print their own direct deposit receipts, which can completely eliminate your monthly paper and postage costs to those providers! We have extensive supporting material to help you roll out on-line claiming, including color flyers that we can print out with your agency's contact information to help encourage providers to claim on-line. Click here for a sample. But with Minute Menu Kids, you get more than just an on-line claiming tool. With an upgrade to Minute Menu Kids Pro, Providers get a wealth of family child care business management tools. They can invoice parents, collect payments from parents electronically, do their taxes (with tips to maximize tax savings), print out certificates for the children, create charts, even put together daily reports for parents. And thanks to our partnership with NAFCC, Minute Menu Kids Pro offers lots of business and child development resources, allowing providers to plan activities and lessons for the kids and otherwise stay totally organized. Minute Menu Kids Pro can be purchased by Providers, or you can buy it at a discount to make it available to all your Providers. Click here for lots of detailed information on Minute Menu Kids and Minute Menu Kids Pro. Either way, Minute Menu Kids is a great way to recruit new Providers to your food program. Think especially of those Tier 2 providers that previously dropped off the food program because it was too much work for not enough money. With Minute Menu Kids, you can go back to these Providers and offer them free software to record their food program claim info in seconds, so there's no more paperwork hassle. And to top it off, using Minute Menu Kids Pro they get all kinds of other features to do their taxes and help manage their child care businesses! For more information, contact us and we can send you a full interest packet describing the software in detail, and we can even give you a demo login to see what on-line claiming will look like for your providers.\n\nMinute Menu HX will actually read all of your provider menus, determine whether USDA nutrition guidelines have been met, make sure the provider isn't in violation of your state licensing capacity rules, and will then calculate all the Tier 1 and Tier 2 meal counts that the provider is eligible to receive. Automatically. The process that now takes you anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes per claim will take only a few seconds. Imagine how more time you and your field staff will have to work with providers! We analyzed a small sample of Sponsors around the nation to find out how much they saved after they began to use Minute Menu. The results were startling. No other system can offer you a comparable cost reduction, because no other system is as comprehensive nor as automated as Minute Menu. Minute Menu HX performs over 150 individual checks on every meal claimed by your Providers. Every requirement written into regulations has been built into Minute Menu. And we've got the results to prove it. Minute Menu has processed over $2 billion in provider claims since 1993, and almost 300 Sponsors in 40 states representing 85,000 family child care providers throughout the nation trust it to handle their needs. Since Minute Menu has undergone countless audits at the state and federal level, Minute Menu is the only system you can trust to maintain the highest standards of Integrity. What Sponsors Say About Minute Menu \"I changed our software to Minute Menu in September 2004 to accommodate all the changes taking place in the CACFP. I was not a computer person AT ALL! I was terrified to make the change but I worked very hard on a start up plan and followed it along with help from Minute Menu. It was the best decision I have made in my 21 years as a director. We did not have one complaint from our over 2100 providers. It took the hassle out of processing menus and now after almost a year I can say I don't worry about new regulations from the USDA concerning meal reimbursement. Minute Menu makes changes to it's software to meet the new regulations and we just process our forms as usual. There are so many neat reports that this software creates that help me in ways I didn't even dream of. Our staff has more time and less stress over getting the menus processed on time.\" For more information, contact us and we can send you a full interest packet describing the software in detail.\n\nWhat truly makes Minute Menu a great product is not just the product itself. In truth, you can have the greatest software in the world installed on your computers, but if your staff doesn't know how to use it, then your computers are glorified paperweights. With Minute Menu, you get training and support that is as top notch as the software itself. Our staff includes former sponsors and a former provider, with tremendous expertise in the CACFP and child care. Our team devotes itself to being expert on all the regulations -- including federal regs, state CACFP regs, and state licensing regs. And we truly engage with each of our clients: we try to understand your existing business processes while helping you adapt to the changes that Minute Menu will bring. In fact, we have a detailed new client orientation process that we follow with each new customer -- working with you every step of the way to help you become completely successful with Minute Menu. Transitioning to an automated system as comprehensive as Minute Menu takes time and patience -- and it's a major undertaking for any organization -- but we work with you every step of the way to ensure you craft appropriate goals and timetables, and help follow thru to ensure those goals and timetables are met. Our team of 15+ people are dedicated solely to meeting the needs of our Sponsors and their providers. Our support team answer calls and emails every Monday thru Friday, 9 to 5 central time. Beyond our support staff, we have over 400 pages of documentation that includes details on every aspect of the software, information on training your providers, and even best practices discussions based on what we've learned from the roughly 300 Sponsors that we already work with. We even offer a biennial training conference, for sponsors and state agency staff, that covers not just the software, but also detailed discussions on CACFP operating best practices unrelated to Minute Menu -- including how to improve the success of your outreach activities. The value of the support we provide to our customers can't be overestimated -- imagine what would happen if you used software to pay providers and something went wrong within the 5 days regulations give you to cut checks to those providers after you receive funds from the state! If you choose a software vendor that is just one person, what happens when that person isn't available that week? Or what if they decide to stop supporting the software entirely? All software has bugs -- even Minute Menu will have the occasional glitch. The difference with Minute Menu is that you can always count on our team to be here when you need us, and to remain completely dedicated to your success. Since 1993 we have been completely dedicated to the Food Program, and there is no other place you can turn that has similar resources or a proven track record of success. And our customers rave about the support we provide. Here's what one of our Sponsors, Valerie from Oregon, said after we helped answer some questions related to food processing rules: \"Thanks for helping with the food list-it's amazing what a difference it makes having it fine-tuned and letting the program do most of the work. We LOVE Minute Menu-I haven't had a day when I regretted choosing MM.\" For more information, contact us and we can send you a full interest packet describing the software in detail.\n\nMinute Menu HX is a client-server application. As such, you can use more than one computer with the software, where one computer runs the Minute Menu HX database and all other computers run the application and connect to that single database. Smaller agencies (with fewer than 300 claiming providers) will typically run Minute Menu HX from only one machine. As such, we’ve split our hardware requirements into categories depending upon networking environment and size. Ranges indicate the difference between minimum and recommended requirements: Supported Operating Systems: Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008 with Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 2, Windows XP with Service Pack 3, Windows Vista with Service Pack 2, Windows 7 and Windows 8.\n\nNot Supported:Windows 2000, Windows 98, Windows Millennium, Windows NT, and older Windows versions. Large Sponsor Notes: Large Sponsors (with 300+ Providers) will be required to purchase a license for SQL Server 2008 R2, Standard Edition. This requires the Microsoft Windows 2003 Server or Microsoft Windows 2008 R2 operating system. Both the operating system and the database software is available for non-profits at extremely discounted rates (prices vary, see vendors below). We recommend that Large Sponsors have a dedicated database machine for Minute Menu HX (that does not run the Minute Menu HX application), as they will see much better performance within the software. For those Sponsors with existing SQL Server 2005 systems, Minute Menu HX requires a SQL user with database ownership (dbo) privileges on the Minute Menu HX database. Very Large Sponsors (1200+ Providers) may be interested in purchasing a more enterprise-caliber database server, with at least a 3 drive RAID-5 hard disk array to maximize hard disk I/O performance. SQL Server 2000 is no longer supported for HX installations. Scanners: OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) scanners are the scanners that read the forms that are scanned into HX.  In order to be compatible with Minute Menu HX, the scanners must have a pencil read head (not an ink read head). These scanners come in several models that are compatible with Minute Menu HX: The following scanner models are no longer manufactured but are usually compatible with Minute Menu HX if they have a pencil read head: New scanners must be purchased through Minute Menu. Click here to view our pricing. For additional questions or information, please contact us. Printers: We do not support dot-matrix printers, except when printing checks. Inkjet, bubble jet, or laser printers are recommended, with speeds of 10ppm (for smaller Sponsors) to 30ppm or greater (for larger Sponsors). When evaluating the speed of a printer, consider printing claim reports: 3 reports of one page each (X) the # of claiming providers = the total number of pages needed. Dedicated Internet access is required in most cases for Minute Menu HX. This can be in the form of DSL, cable modem, wireless point-to-point, satellite/Direct-TV, or a dedicated telecommunication line like a T1. Below are ranges for required connectivity. If you plan on accessing Minute Menu HX off-site, you may need to greatly exceed these minimums. See the WebKids User’s Manual for more information. In general, any Windows computer will work for WebKids. Internet Explorer 6.0+ is required. A printer will be required. Internet access of some kind is required; high-speed Internet access is recommended. Macintosh operating systems will only work if Virtual PC is installed, and then only the downloadable Minute Menu Kids software will function. The Minute Menu HX system transfers large amounts of information over the Internet via the Transfer Data function. To ensure your data remains completely secure, special encryption mechanisms are used, as well as specific Internet ports. These ports are typically open on an outbound basis, even when Firewalls are used. But any software or hardware Firewall in use must be configured to allow Minute Menu HX to communicate via the Internet. Please contact us for specific information on the ports used, and the connection types employed. Non-profit agencies can typically acquire licenses for Microsoft Windows & SQL Server at highly discounted rates.

gulf of mexico at 1300 cdt on 26 may 2010 the procedure was intended to stem the flow of oil and gas and ultimately kill the well by injecting heavy drilling fluids through the blowout preventer on the seabed down into the well despite successfully pumping a total of over 30000 barrels of heavy mud in three attempts at rates of up to 80 barrels a minute and deploying a wide range of different bridging materials the operation did not overcome the flow from the well the government together with bp has therefore decided to move to the next step in the subsea operations the deployment of the lower marine riser package lmrp cap containment system the operational plan first involves cutting and then removing the damaged riser from the top of the failed blowout preventer bop to leave a cleanlycut pipe at the top of the bops lmrp the cap is designed to be connected to a riser from the discoverer enterprise drillship and placed over the lmrp with the intention of capturing most of the oil and gas flowing from the well the lmrp cap is already on site and it is currently anticipated that it will be connected in about four days this operation has not been previously carried out in 5000ft of water and the successful deployment of the containment system can not be assured drilling of the first relief well continues and is currently at 12090ft drilling of the second relief well is temporarily suspended and is expected to recommence shortly from 8576 feet 28 may top kill continues preparations for alternative solutions president obama visits the louisiana coast for a second time saying i am the president and the buck stops with me bp reveals that the cost of the cleanup operation has reached 930m £640m claims for loss and damage mount up subsea efforts continue to focus on progressing steps to stop the flow of oil from the well through interventions via the failed deepwater horizon blow out preventer bop and to collect the flow of oil from the leak points these efforts are being carried out in conjunction with industry experts and governmental authorities operations on the top kill procedure continue heavy drilling fluids were pumped under pressure into the bop starting 26 may at 1300cdt and top kill operations continue through 2400cdt on 27 may it is estimated that the full top kill procedure could extend for another 48 hours if the well were successfully killed it is expected that cementing operations would then follow the top kill procedure has never before been attempted at these depths and its ultimate success is uncertain in parallel with top kill preparations have been made for the possible deployment of the lower marine riser package lmrp cap containment system deployment would first involve removing the damaged riser from the top of the failed bop to leave a cleanlycut pipe at the top of the bops lmrp the cap a containment device with a sealing grommet will be connected to a riser from the discoverer enterprise drillship 5000ft above on the surface and placed over the lmrp with the intention of capturing most of the oil and gas flowing from the well the lmrp cap is already deployed alongside the bop in readiness for potential deployment if it is decided to deploy this option this would be expected to take some three to four days in addition to these steps planning is being advanced for deploying if necessary a second bop on top of the original failed bop drilling of two relief wells began on 2 may and 16 may it is estimated that each of these wells will take three months to complete from the commencement of drilling work continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea to protect the shoreline of the gulf of mexico and to collect and clean up any oil that has reached shore almost 1300 vessels are now involved in the response effort including skimmers tugs barges and recovery vessels operations to skim oil from the surface of the water have now recovered in total some 274000 barrels 115 million gallons of oily liquid the total length of containment boom deployed as part of efforts to prevent oil reaching the coast is now almost 19 million feet and an additional 125 million feet of sorbent boom has also been deployed so far 26000 claims for loss and damage have been filed and 11650 payments have already been made bp has received over 96000 calls into its help lines to date deepwater drilling ban extended president obama extends ban on new deepwater oil drilling permits for wells over 500ft for a further six months 26 may bp starts a top kill manoeuvre designed to choke off the oil spill it involves forcefeeding heavy drilling mud and cement on to the leak top kill is intended to stem the flow of oil and gas and ultimately kill the well by injecting heavy drilling fluids through the blow out preventer on the seabed down into the well pumping started at 1900 uk and 1300 cdt and continues the company has also announced that it will appoint an independent mediator to review and assist in the claims process for the spill associated with the exploratory well that was being drilled by the transocean deepwater horizon in mississippi canyon block 252 bp has said consistently that it will pay legitimate claims for loss and damage caused by the spill bp remains fully committed to responding to and paying claims promptly to date more than 26000 claims already have been submitted resulting in payments exceeding 36m we are absolutely committed to a simple fair claims process that gets funds to people who have been hurt by this disaster as quickly as possible said bp chief executive tony hayward we have opened claims offices across the region and will make every effort to reach everyone who has a legitimate claim and we will appoint an independent mediator so that we have as fair a process as possible for everyone in the gulf region subsea efforts continue via the mc252 blow out preventer bop efforts being carried out in conjunction with industry experts and governmental authorities plans have been developed for a series of interventions via the bop it is currently anticipated these may be carried out over a period of about a week commencing in the next few days these interventions have not been carried out at these depths and conditions before and the success of individual options can not be assured the first planned intervention is the socalled top kill operation where heavy drilling fluids would be injected into the well to stem the flow of oil and gas and ultimately kill the well most of the equipment is on site and preparations for this operation continue with a view to deployment within a few days if necessary equipment is also in place to combine this operation with the injection under pressure of bridging material to seal off upward flow through the bop sophisticated diagnostic work using remotelyoperated vehicles rovs will precede the top kill to allow the procedure to be planned in detail the knowledge from this diagnostic work will be instrumental in determining whether to proceed with this option being progressed in parallel with plans for the top kill is development of a lower marine riser package or lmrp cap containment option this would first involve removing the damaged riser from the top of the bop leaving a cleanlycut pipe at the top of the bops lmrp the lmrp cap an engineered containment device with a sealing grommet would be connected to a riser from the discoverer enterprise drillship and then placed over the lmrp with the intention of capturing most of the oil and gas flowing from the well and transporting it to the drillship on the surface the lmrp cap is already on site and it is anticipated that this option will be available for deployment by the end of may additional options also continue to be progressed including the option of lowering a second blowout preventer or a valve on top of the mc 252 bop 25 may bp chief executive tony hayward visits the hit area and announces himself devastated by what he has seen the oil major also announces that its internal investigation team has begun sharing initial perspectives of its review of the causes of the tragic deepwater horizon fire and oil spill the investigation is a factfinding effort that has not reached final conclusions but has identified various issues for further inquiry bp has shared these early perspectives with the department of the interior and will do so with all official regulatory inquiries into the accident as requested this is an internal investigation there is extensive further work to do including further interviews and in addition full forensic examinations of the blow out preventer bop the wellhead and the rig itself all of which are still currently on the sea bed the internal investigation was launched on 21 april 2010 and is being conducted by bps head of group safety and operations he has an independent reporting line to the group chief executive the investigation teams work thus far shows that this accident was brought about by the failure of a number of processes systems and equipment there were multiple control mechanisms— procedures and equipment—in place that should have prevented this accident or reduced the impact of the spill the investigation is focused on the following seven mechanisms the cement that seals the reservoir from the well the casing system which seals the well bore the pressure tests to confirm the well is sealed the execution of procedures to detect and control hydrocarbons in the well including the use of the bop the bop emergency disconnect system which can be activated by pushing a button at multiple locations on the rig the automatic closure of the bop after its connection is lost with the rig features in the bop to allow remotely operated vehicles rov to close the bop and thereby seal the well at the seabed after a blow out i understand people want a simple answer about why this happened and who is to blame the honest truth is that this is a complex accident caused by an unprecedented combination of failures said chief executive tony hayward a number of companies are involved including bp and it is simply too early – and not up to us – to say who is at fault this is a basic summary of the facts as gathered by the investigation team to date a lot remains unknown but we hope that the briefings will help the governments inquiries this was a tragic accident and we need to understand the causes of it to try to ensure that nothing like it ever happens again 24 may oil and gas collection continues through the ritt us government appoints a team to determine the flow dispersal and collection of leaked oil continues work goes on to optimise the oil and gas collected from the damaged riser through the riser insertion tube tool ritt the collection rate continues to vary primarily due to the flow parameters and physical characteristics within the riser in the period from 1723 may the daily oil rate collected by the ritt has ranged from 1360 barrels of oil per day bd to 3000 bd and the daily gas rate has ranged from 4 million cubic feet per day mmcfd to 17 mmcfd in the same period the average daily rate of oil and gas collected by the ritt containment system at the end of the leaking riser has been 2010 barrels of oil per day bopd and 10 mmcfd of gas the oil is being stored and gas is being flared on the drillship discoverer enterprise on the surface 5000ft above the ritt remains a new technology and both its continued operation and its effectiveness in capturing the oil and gas remain uncertain the us government has appointed a flow rate technical team frtt to determine the well flow rate the frtt includes the us coast guard noaa mms department of energy and the us geological survey bp will continue to promptly provide all information necessary to make as accurate an assessment as possible of the rate of flow work also continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea over 1100 vessels are involved in the response effort including skimmers tugs barges and recovery vessels intensive operations to skim oil from the surface of the water have now recovered in total some 243000 barrels 102 million gallons of oily liquid the total length of boom deployed as part of efforts to prevent oil reaching the coast is now nearly 25 million feet including over 730000ft of sorbent boom the cost of the response to date amounts to about 760m including the cost of the spill response containment relief well drilling grants to the gulf states claims paid and federal costs it is too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated with the incident 21 may bp reiterates transparency pledge bp reiterates its pledge to be open and transparent in its response to the oil spill in the gulf of mexico the company confirms its continuing commitment to cooperate with the department of homeland security dhs and the environmental protection agency epa in facilitating access by the us government and the public to samplingmonitoring data on the deepwater horizon spill response the commitment is made in a letter sent to janet napolitano secretary of homeland security and lisa jackson administrator of the epa we are committed to providing the american people with the information they need to understand the environmental impact from the spill and the response steps that have been taken said bps chief executive tony hayward we share with you a strong commitment to transparency bp is working handinhand with federal state and local governments to gather data on the seabed and in the water and to incorporate those lessons so that we can continually improve the effectiveness of our response efforts hayward added 20 may first heavy oil from the spill reaches the louisiana coast hitting wildlife sanctuaries attempts continue to skim leaked oil bp continues to develop options to shut off the flow of oil from the well through interventions via the failed bop plans continue to develop a so called top kill operation where heavy drilling fluids are injected into the well to stem the flow of oil and gas followed by cement to seal the well most of the equipment is on site and preparations continue for this operation with a view to deployment in the next few days options have also been developed to potentially combine this with the injection under pressure of a variety of materials into the bop to seal off upward flow work on the first relief well which began on 2 may continues the ddii drilling rig began drilling the second relief well on 16 may each of these wells is estimated to take some three months to complete from the commencement of drilling work continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea over 930 vessels are involved in the response effort including skimmers tugs barges and recovery vessels intensive operations to skim oil from the surface of the water have now recovered in total some 187000 barrels 78 million gallons of oily liquid the total length of boom deployed as part of efforts to prevent oil reaching the coast is now more than 19 million feet including over 500000ft of sorbent boom in total over 19000 personnel from bp other companies and government agencies are currently involved in the response to this incident so far about 19000 claims have been filed and some 8000 payments have been made 18 may rider insertion tube tool ritt solution attempted the riser insertion tube tool ritt containment system that was put into place in the end of the leaking riser is operational it is estimated to be collecting and carrying about 2000 barrels a day bd of oil to flow up to the drillship discoverer enterprise on the surface 5000ft above produced oil is being stored on the drillship while produced gas is being flared it is expected that it will take some time to increase the flow through the system and maximise the proportion of oil and gas flowing through the broken riser that will be captured and transported to the drillship this remains a new technology and both its continued operation and its effectiveness in capturing the oil and gas remain uncertain other containment options continue to be progressed the company also continues to develop options to shut off the flow of oil from the well through interventions via the failed bop plans continue to develop a so called top kill operation where heavy drilling fluids are injected into the well to stem the flow of oil and gas followed by cement to seal the well most of the equipment is on site and preparations continue for this operation with a view to deployment in the next week or so options have also been developed to potentially combine this with the injection under pressure of a variety of materials into the bop to seal off upward flow work on the first relief well which began on may 2 continues the ddii drilling rig began drilling the second relief well on may 16 each of these wells is estimated to take some three months to complete from the commencement of drilling work continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea over 750 vessels are involved in the response effort including skimmers tugs barges and recovery vessels intensive operations to skim oil from the surface of the water have now recovered in total some 158000 barrels 66 million gallons of oily liquid the total length of boom deployed as part of efforts to prevent oil reaching the coast is now more than 17 million feet including over 400000ft of sorbent boom 17 may allegations of incomplete documentation refuted by bp bp says a fifth of the oil gushing out is now being captured company has rebutted allegations that its atlantis platform in the gulf of mexico operated with incomplete and inaccurate engineering documents responding to claims that flawed or missing documentation posed a threat to safe operation of the platform recently made in various news programmes and print media bp says it had thoroughly investigated these claims when they were first made by a former contract worker in 2009 and found them to be without substance the investigation found that the operators on the platform had full access to the accurate uptodate drawings topsides hull and subsea necessary to operate the platform safely a second investigation of the same allegations by the ombudsmans office focused on project document and filing procedures and has no bearing on operating or regulatory issues after this review bp made some procedural changes in the project execution plan but these likewise had no connection with the safe operation of the platform as ceo tony hayward constantly makes clear safe and reliable operations are his number 1 priority for bp and the company has a very strong record of safe and reliable operations in the gulf of mexico a company spokesman said it is completely erroneous to suggest that the minor internal process issue we identified and immediately amended last year on the atlantis platform suggests anything different the design construction installation and operation of atlantis have received a high level of oversight by both the us minerals management service mms and the us coast guard bp has and will continue to work with the mms or any other regulator when concerns are raised about any aspect of our operation the atlantis field has been in service since october 2007 and has safely produced many million barrels of oil the platform was successfully maintained through the course of two major hurricanes in 2008 its safety operations and performance record is excellent 15 may deepsea robots in tube attempt bp starts its latest attempt to stop the leak using deepsea robots to put a 6inwide tube with a rubber stopper into the faulty pipe 14 may president obama ups his criticism tony hayward responds president obama slams the ridiculous spectacle of oil industry officials pointing the finger of blame at each other we absolutely understand and share president obamas sense of urgency over the length of time this complex task is taking tony hayward bp group chief executive said we want to thank the president and his administration for their ongoing engagement in this effort bp working closely with scientists and engineers from across the whole oil industry from government agencies and departments and with local officials along the gulf coast is focused on doing everything in our power to stop the flow of oil remove it from the surface and protect the shoreline we are working with state and community leaders to mitigate the impact on the lives and livelihoods of those who have been affected and while we continue in these efforts we are participating fully in investigations that will provide valuable lessons about how to prevent future incidents of this nature 13 may efforts to stem the flow continue options for a more permanent solution explored costs mount subsea efforts continue to focus on firstly progressing options to stop the flow of oil from the well through interventions via the blow out preventer bop and secondly attempts to contain the flow of oil at source to reduce the amount spreading on the surface these efforts are carried out in conjunction with governmental authorities and other industry experts further investigation of the failed bop using remotelyoperated vehicles and a variety of diagnostic techniques increases understanding of the condition of the bop and allows planning to continue for a number of potential interventions including for a socalled top kill of the well plans for this option are being developed in preparation for potential application next week work to deploy a second system designed to contain the oil flow subsea continues the deployment of this top hat system is expected to be attempted within the next few days all of the techniques being attempted or evaluated to contain the flow of oil on the seabed involve significant uncertainties because they have not been tested in these conditions before work on the first relief well which began on sunday 2 may continues the drilling rig that will drill the second relief well is en route to the site expected to arrive by friday work continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea over 530 vessels are involved in the response effort including skimmers tugs barges and recovery vessels over 120 flights have been made to apply dispersant to the spill since the response effort began intensive operations to skim oil from the surface of the water also continue some 97000 barrels of oily liquid have now been recovered the total length of boom deployed as part of efforts to prevent oil reaching the coast is now more than 12 million feet with a further 400000ft staged in readiness for deployment in total over 13000 personnel from bp other companies and government agencies are involved in the response to this incident over 16000 people have registered to volunteer across four states so far 6700 claims have been filed of which about 1000 have already been paid bp has also received 46500 calls into its help lines approximately 30 per cent of which have offered ideas to help the response or other assistance the cost to date of the response amounts to about 450m including the cost of spill response containment relief well drilling commitments to the gulf coast states settlements and federal costs 11 may political fallout escalates bp executives appear before a congressional hearing in washington senate energy committee chairman jee bingman says the rig explosion was a result of a cascade of errors 10 may resumption of efforts to reduce the flow after containment dome fails relief well work continues subsea efforts continue to focus on two fronts first reducing the flow of oil spilled by physical containment and second further work on stopping the flow using a top kill option the containment dome that was deployed last week has been parked away from the spill area on the sea bed efforts to place it over the main leak point were suspended at the weekend as a build up of hydrates prevented a successful placement of the dome over the spill area a second smaller containment dome is being readied to lower over the main leak point the small dome will be connected by drill pipe and riser lines to a drill ship on the surface to collect and treat oil it is designed to mitigate the formation of large hydrate volumes this operation has never been done before in 5000ft of water in addition further work on the blow out preventer has positioned us to attempt a top kill option aimed at stopping the flow of oil from the well this option will be pursued in parallel with the smaller containment dome over the next two weeks all of the techniques being attempted or evaluated to contain the flow of oil on the seabed involve significant uncertainties because they have not been tested in these conditions before the company continues to do everything it can in conjunction with governmental authorities and other industry experts to find a solution to stem the flow of oil on the seabed work on the first relief well which began on sunday may 2 continues it is expected to take some three months to complete work continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea more than 275 vessels are being used including skimmers tugs barges and recovery vessels the volume of dispersant applied to the spill on the surface amounts to over 315000 gallons since the spill response began intensive operations to skim oil from the surface of the water also continued some 90000 barrels of oily liquid has now been recovered the total length of deployed boom is now more than 1 million feet as part of the efforts to stop oil reaching the coast 9 may junk shot blocking attempt announced bp announces it is to attempt to plug the broken pipe with a junk shot consisting of golf balls bits of tyres and mud 7 may engineers lower a 100tonne steel and concrete cap efforts to stem the flow suffer a setback after crystal buildup within a speciallymade 100t steel and concrete containment dome render it too buoyant the dome had arrived on location from port fourchon louisiana once lowered to the sea bed the next steps were to be to connect the 40x24x14ft steel dome to a vessel on the surface work on the first relief well which began on sunday 2 may continues it is expected to take some three months to complete work continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea more than 260 vessels are being used including skimmers tugs barges and recovery vessels 18 flights over the spill are carried out during the day and operations to skim oil from the surface of the water also continue as the seas become calmer to date the oil spill response team has recovered about 30000 barrels of oilwater mix the total length of deployed boom is now over 700000ft as part of the efforts to stop oil reaching the coast some one million feet is available and more than 300000ft is on order suitable weather conditions allow controlled burning of surface oil a bpled effort to address shoreline cleanup continues more than 4000 people have been trained out of about 30000 volunteers to deal with oil as it comes onshore 6 may containment dome ready to be shipped work continues to attempt to bring the mc252 oil well under control to stop the flow of oil and to contain the oil subsea a valve that had been attached to the end of a broken drill pipe one of the three points from which oil was leaking was closed this has stopped the flow from this point but is not expected to affect the overall rate of flow from the well bp continues to use remotely operated vehicles to monitor the flow of oil from the other two leak points a containment dome is loaded aboard a transport vessel at port fourchon louisiana and begins its transport to the mc252 well site the 40x24x14 feet steel vessel which weighs almost 100 tons is expected to be lowered to the seabed today the drilling of the first relief well which began on sunday may 2 continues it is estimated that it will take some three months to complete work continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea and to protect the shoreline by midafternoon 12 flights over the spill had been completed delivering a total of 34000 gallons of dispersant during the day further in situ burning of oil on the surface of the water was carried out 80000ft of boom is deployed during the day this brings the total length of boom now deployed to protect the shore to over 100 miles more than 11000 people have so far volunteered to assist in efforts to protect the coastline and in the clean up of any spill more than 4000 have already received training 5 may bp claims one of three leaks stopped company grants funds to four states for area contingency plans containment dome preparations continue bp announces it has stopped the flow of oil from one of the three existing leak points on the damaged mc252 oil well and riser in the gulf of mexico while this is not expected to affect the overall rate of flow from the well it is expected to reduce the complexity of the situation being dealt with on the seabed separately bp announces that it has made 25m block grants to each of the states of louisiana alabama mississippi and florida to help accelerate the implementation of area contingency plans acps these approved plans address the removal of a worst case spill and are designed to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat to sensitive areas the grants bp has made to the four states do not affect bps mc252 response or existing claims process but are supplemental to them and are intended to enable local businesses to support cleanup and recovery efforts each state will administer its 25m grant tony hayward bp group chief executive we are continuing to do all we can to stop the flow of oil from the well and also attack and capture the spilled oil offshore however it is also vital that we work together with government and potentially impacted communities to protect the shoreline from any impact of the spill we hope these grants will support the effective deployment of preprepared response plans in each state at the mc252 well using remotely operated vehicles rovs a valve is installed on the end of a broken drill pipe one of the three points from which oil was leaking the rovs first cut the end of the pipe to leave a clean end and the valve weighing over half a ton was placed in position on the seabed overnight the rovs completed securely joining the valve to the broken drill pipe and then closed it shutting off the flow from that pipe the rovs will continue to closely monitor the well and remaining flow points to look for any changes bp continues to make plans for the loading and movement of a first containment dome from dock at port fourchon louisiana out to the well site it is planned to lower the dome over one of the leak sites on the seabed and then connect it by pipe to a specialist vessel at the surface this system is designed to help capture the oil at the seabed and collect it securely for processing the dome is currently expected to be lowered to the wellsite seabed in around three days time allowing the process of testing and commissioning to begin only once this is complete will the effectiveness of the system be demonstrated bps initial onshore response efforts focused on louisiana and rapidly expand with equipment and people staged and ready in mississippi alabama and florida bp positions rapid response teams in mobile alabama and houma louisiana to enable quick response and cleaning of areas where oil may come ashore these 12person teams will assess initial impacts and then call in a larger contingent of trained responders and volunteers to clean the affected area bp is also setting up a rapid response team for chandeleur island in addition bp has been hosting town hall meetings in gulf coast communities for those who wish to volunteer on a cleanup crew or to volunteer their vessels for marine work more than 2000 volunteers have been signed up and trained by bp bp has a supply of boom and other resources on hand to cover the next seven to ten days of planned response activity and has put in place a supply chain that should enable it to deliver additional supplies as needs arise there are now nine staging areas across the gulf coast four in louisiana and three in mississippi and one each in alabama and florida 4 may bp announces that sealing off the ruptured oil well could take some three months trial of dispersants costs mount bp announces that work has begun to drill a relief well to intercept and isolate the oil well that is spilling oil in the us gulf of mexico the drilling began at 1500cdt 2100bst on sunday 2 may the new well in 5000ft of water is planned to intercept the existing well around 13000ft below the seabed and permanently seal it the new drill site is about half a mile on the seabed from the leaking well in mississippi canyon block 252 and drilling is estimated to take some three months bp group chief executive tony hayward this is another key step in our work to permanently stop the loss of oil from the well at the same time we are continuing with our efforts to stop the leak and control the oil at the seabed to tackle the oil offshore and to protect the shoreline through a massive effort together with government agencies and local communities the company also carries out a second approved trial injection of dispersants directly into the oil flow at a point close to the main leak on the seabed the technique is intended to efficiently mix the oil and dispersant breaking up and dispersing accumulations of oil and allowing it to degrade naturally and reduce surface impact the suggestion for this innovative technique came from the companies across the oil industry that bp approached last week for further ideas and expertise to help bp control the well and tackle the spill rapid progress is also reported in constructing a coffer dam or containment canopy a 14 x 24 x 40 foot steel canopy has already been fabricated and othersized canopies are under construction and being sourced once lowered over the leak site and connected by pipe the canopy is designed to channel the flow of oil from the subsea to the surface where it could be processed and stored safely on board a specialist vessel weather permitting first installation of a canopy on site is expected to start in a little over a week allowing the process of testing and commissioning to begin only once this is complete will the effectiveness of the system be demonstrated at the seabed bp continues to use up to eight remotely operated vehicles rovs to work on the blowout preventer and subsea equipment accurate estimation of the rate of flow is difficult but estimates by the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa suggest some 5000 barrels 210000 us gallons of oil per day are escaping from the well on the surface weather hampers surface operations over the weekend but is forecast to improve in coming days bp currently has 230000 gallons of dispersant available to deploy once the sea state is calm enough and a further 208000 gallons on order offshore booms and specialist oil spill response vessels skimmers and barges will return to operation in calmer seas treating and collecting as much oil as possible before it reaches the coast the onshore activity is focused on six locations in the potentially affected states venice and port sulphur louisiana pascagoula and biloxi mississippi mobile alabama and pensacola florida staging posts are in place stocked with people and material to help protect the shoreline in each area work is continuing to install marine protection booms along the coast hundreds of thousands of feet of boom have been deployed and to date 2000 volunteers have been trained to assist in the response effort whilst difficult to accurately estimate the cost to the mc252 owners of the efforts to contain the spill and secure the well is currently estimated to be more than 6m per day this figure is rising as activity increases it is too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated with the incident 3 may bp negotiates political and pr minefield bps chief executive tony hayward states it is bps responsibility to deal with the leak and to clean up the oil and adds that this was not our accident the company stresses that contrary to some media reports the actions it has taken to date on the blow out preventer have not resulted in any observed reduction in the rate of flow of oil from the mc252 well in a sepetate matter bp chief executive tony hayward replies to president obama the us government leadership here has been excellent since day one i agree with the president that the top priority right now is to stop the leak and mitigate the damage i reiterated my commitment to the white house today that bp will do anything and everything we can to stop the leak attack the spill off shore and protect the shorelines of the gulf coast we appreciate the tireless efforts of the many federal state and local responders and the volunteers men and women who have worked tirelessly since the date of the accident to mitigate the damage our teams are working hand in hand and we look forward to hearing more recommendations for action from the presidents visit today 2 may obama visits the scene bp chairman explains recovery plan president obama visits the region for the first time since the disaster vows bp will pay for the massive damage caused and warns of a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster bps chairman lamar mckay tell abcs this week that a failed piece of equipment was to blame for the blast he adds that engineers are working on a dome to be placed over the the well in six to eight days 1 may bp implicated in critical documents documents emerge showing that bp downplayed the chances of a catastrophic accident at deepwater horizon a 52page exploration plan repeatedly states that it was virtually impossible for such an explosion to take place 30 april offshore oil drilling leases suspended shore protection efforts picked up president obama orders no new offshore oil drilling leases will be issued unless companies can prove that a repeat of the slick is impossible bp continues to ramp up its response to the oil spill in the us gulf of mexico over 2500 personnel are now involved in the response effort and welladvanced preparations are being made for a major protection and cleaning effort on the shorelines of louisiana mississippi alabama and florida a fourth onshore command centre in mobile alabama opens tony hayward bp group chief executive in the past few days i have seen the full extent of bps global resources and capability being brought to bear on this problem and welcome the offers of further assistance we have had from government agencies oil companies and members of the public to defend the shoreline and fight this spill we will be judged by the success we have in dealing with this incident and we are determined to succeed work progresses to install marine protection booms along the coast as well as almost 220000ft of boom already in the water an additional 300000ft is staged or in the process of being deployed with more on the way the onshore activity focuses on five locations in the potentially affected states venice louisiana pascagoula and biloxi mississippi mobile alabama and pensacola florida staging posts are in place stocked with people and material including about 100000ft of boom to protect the shoreline in each area a sixth staging post is set up in port sulphur louisiana hayward adds bp is fully committed to taking all possible steps to contain the spread of the oil spill we are taking full responsibility for the spill and we will clean it up and where people can present legitimate claims for damages we will honour them bp continues to attack the spill on many fronts making continuing attempts to prevent oil escaping from the subsea well 5000ft below the surface collecting and separating the oil which enters the water deploying innovative technology to disperse the oil at its seabed source and drilling a relief well to permanently isolate and secure the leaking well in parallel at the surface bps

            "text": "The scramble to contain the fallout from the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico has stretched the relationship between BP and the United States government to breaking point. E&T's timeline below keeps tabs on the latest developments.\n\nThe 48-hour ambient pressure test is deemed successful and BP is authorised to begin open-water fishing operations from the MC252 Blow Out Preventer (BOP). The fishing operations aim at removing drill pipe within the MC252 BOP.\n\nFollowing successful fishing operations BP will proceed with replacement of the original BOP with the BOP from the Transocean Development Driller II (DDII). In anticipation of a successful operation, the DDII sets a storm packer and has unlatches its BOP from the second relief well site.\n\nIf fishing operations are unsuccessful, BP and the federal science team will execute contingency procedures to be carried out under the approval from the NIC.\n\nBP flushes drilling mud and hydrocarbons from the MC252 well sealing cap and the original Deepwater Horizon Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP) and Blow Out Preventer (BOP). The flushing is in advance of a pressure test procedure that will study the well’s BOP stack and sealing cap under ambient conditions.\n\nThe work involves the following steps: First the Discoverer Enterprise attached a drill string to the top of the existing sealing cap, before the middle blind shears of the sealing cap are opened. Then the Q-4000 pumps an ‘anti-freeze’ mixture down through the existing manifold and into the BOP’s choke and kill lines. The liquid used in the flushing is completely contained and carried to the surface through the Enterprise drill string.\n\nFollowing the flushing, the sealing cap’s blind shear ram is closed. If all this goes to plan an ambient pressure test is conducted to reassure that the well is secure.\n\nThe test is to be conducted over a 48-hour period, which mimics twice the time estimated to remove the original BOP and replace it with the Transocean Development Driller II (DDII) BOP.\n\nBP completes the four-hour near ambient pressure test on the MC252 well in the Gulf of Mexico. The results are under review between BP and the federal science team and a recommendation on the path forward is expected to go to the NIC.\n\nBP completes cementing operations at the MC252 well at 14:15 CDT, as part of the static kill procedure.\n\nBP continues the ongoing relief well operations. Depending upon weather conditions, mid-August is the current estimate of the most likely date by which the first relief well will intercept the Macondo well annulus.\n\nBP announce that the MC252 well appears to have reached a static condition – a significant milestone. The well pressure is now being controlled by the hydrostatic pressure of the drilling mud, i.e. the desired outcome of the static kill procedure carried out on 3 August.\n\nPumping of heavy drilling mud into the well from vessels on the surface was stopped after about eight hours of pumping.\n\nBased on the results of an injectivity test, BP starts pumping drilling mud as part of static-kill operations. The aim of these procedures is to assist with the strategy to kill and isolate the well, and will complement the upcoming relief well operation\n\nAfter a weekend of speculation, BP announces the planned replacement of chief executive Tony Hayward on 1 October. He will be replaced by current managing director Bob Dudley. Englishman Hayward had been removed from directing the clean-up operation after a series of perceived public-relations gaffes and a bruising appearance before the US House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and was replaced by the American Dudley. Hayward is likely to retain a position in the company, with BP reportedly planning to nominate him as a non-executive director of its Russian joint-venture TNK-BP.\n\nThe latest tropical storm to hit the Gulf of Mexico, Bonnie, forces dozens of ships to leave the area, delaying recovery efforts for 24 hours. The previous storm to pass through the area was Alex on 1 July.\n\nUS President Obama hosts UK Prime Minister David Cameron at the White House for the first time since Cameron became Prime Minister. The two men discuss the situation regarding the leak, and allegations that BP was instrumental in the release of convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi in order to gain favour with Libya over oil contracts.\n\nCameron warns US legislators not to single out BP over oil damages. He argues: \"Would it be right to have legislation that independently targets BP rather than other companies? I don't think that would be right ... Would it be right to say that BP has to pay compensation for damages that were nothing to do directly with the spill? I don't think that would be right.\"\n\nThe successful placement of the new cap on the well is called into question as a possible methane leak is detected on the seabed. The US government is reported to be anxious about allowing the new cap to remain if it causes less controllable seepage from elsewhere on the pipeline.\n\nA US Congressional committee agrees to implement measures that would preclude companies with poor offshore safety records from drilling for seven years.\n\nMeanwhile, US politicians have announced a hearing, to take place on 29 July, into whether a BP offshore oil drilling contact deal was involved in securing the release of convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi.\n\nBP delays pressure testing on the newly installed well cap, saying that further analysis is needed to ensure that pressure testing will not rupture the pipeline in other locations, producing a worse scenario.\n\nAfter seemingly successful installation of new cap, BP prepares to adjust oil pressure to test whether it will hold the flow of oil.\n\nBP begins attempts to install new, 'improved' sealing cap to more effectively stem the flow of oil while relief well drilling continues. The company warns that the installation will involve allowing oil to flow freely into the Gulf for a short while, and that the new cap's \"efficiency and ability to contain the oil and gas cannot be assured\", as it has never been attempted at these depths before.\n\nBP announces that the costs so far of implementing the oil-spill recovery have topped £2bn ($3.12bn).\n\nThe UK Government rejects calls by UK Green Party Leader Caroline Lucas for a moratorium on deep sea offshore drilling in the North Sea.\n\nTaiwanese vessel A Whale, owned by TMT, commences testing to vacuum up oily water, separate the oil and return the water to the sea. It is reported to be able to do this at a rate of 21 million gallons of oil a day – the largest such vessel in the world. Some 500 smaller scooping vessels have been struggling against poor weather conditions brought about by Hurricane Alex.\n\nSituation in the Gulf of Mexico 'not yet an environmental catastrophe', but which could become one as hurricane season kicks in.\n\nBP hunts for investors to ward off predators for its ailing oil business.\n\nPlans to increase oil capture are delayed by a week to allow Hurricane Alex to pass through the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nCongress votes to lift all caps on liability in oil spills, and moves to deny offshore leases to companies with poor track records.\n\nThe G8 and G20 summits in Canada offer PM David Cameron and President Obama the opportunity to discuss BP face to face. They emerge from talks agreeing that BP must meet its clean-up obligations, but also that it was in both countries' interests that the company remained a \"strong and stable\" business.\n\nUS federal court judge Martin Feldman blocks President Barack Obama's six-month ban on deep-water drilling, calling it \"invalid\". The decision to suspend drilling of wells in the depths over 500ft \"simply cannot justify the immeasurable effect on the plaintiffs, the local economy, the Gulf region,\" Feldman says. The White House plans to appeal the ban.\n\nBP chief relieved of daily control of spill crisis, and is replaced by managing director Bob Dudley.\n\nBP chief executive Tony Hayward faces a US congressional hearing before the US House Committee on Energy and Commerce. His insistence on waiting for the outcome of multiple investigations into the disaster leads the hearing to accuse him of 'stonewalling'. Hayward is also accused of accused of ignoring safety warnings and shirking responsibility.\n\nBP bosses summoned to a White House meeting with Obama. The company agrees to setting up a $20bn dollar (£13.5bn) compensation fund. It also announces it is to scrap dividend payments for the rest of 2010.\n\nInternational credits ratings agency Fitch slashes BP's credit rating six notches from \"AA\" to 'near junk' \"BBB\" rating.\n\nBP board meet in London to discuss deferring its second-quarter dividend to help pay for the clean-up job.\n\nPresident Barack Obama invokes the influence of the 9/11 terror attacks, saying: \"In the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11, this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come.\"\n\nPresident Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron hold a 30-minute phone call over the spill. The US President assures the Prime Minister that his criticisms of BP have \"nothing to do with national identity\".\n\nBP shares take a fresh pounding, tumbling by as much as 11 per cent after hitting a 14-year low in New York. London Mayor Boris Johnson leads a backlash against the US administration, hitting out at \"anti-British rhetoric\", \"buck-passing\" and \"attempts to damage the reputation of a great British company\".\n\nShares in BP continue to fall, dropping more than 4 per cent. Meanwhile, concern is aired over the effect of President Obama's attacks on the company and its UK investors. One City commentator accuses the president of having \"his boot on the throat of British pensioners\".\n\nPresident Obama launches a stinging attack on BP's chief executive. Obama says he would have sacked Hayward over some of his past comments if he was one of his staff. The government of Norway announces a ban on new deepwater oil drilling projects in the North Sea.\n\nAlmost half a million gallons of oil a day are being prevented from spilling into the ocean as a result of the cap, BP says.\n\nThe US government announces it is to pursue criminal and civil investigations into the spill; Shares in BP plunge by 17 per cent – its biggest one-day fall for 18 years.\n\nBP started the 'top kill' operations to stop the flow of oil from the MC252 well in the Gulf of Mexico at 1300 CDT on 26 May 2010. The procedure was intended to stem the flow of oil and gas and ultimately kill the well by injecting heavy drilling fluids through the blow-out preventer on the seabed, down into the well.\n\nDespite successfully pumping a total of over 30,000 barrels of heavy mud, in three attempts at rates of up to 80 barrels a minute, and deploying a wide range of different bridging materials, the operation did not overcome the flow from the well.\n\nThe Government, together with BP, has therefore decided to move to the next step in the subsea operations, the deployment of the Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP) Cap Containment System.\n\nThe operational plan first involves cutting and then removing the damaged riser from the top of the failed Blow-Out Preventer (BOP) to leave a cleanly-cut pipe at the top of the BOP's LMRP. The cap is designed to be connected to a riser from the Discoverer Enterprise drillship and placed over the LMRP with the intention of capturing most of the oil and gas flowing from the well. The LMRP cap is already on site and it is currently anticipated that it will be connected in about four days.\n\nThis operation has not been previously carried out in 5,000ft of water and the successful deployment of the containment system cannot be assured.\n\nDrilling of the first relief well continues and is currently at 12,090ft. Drilling of the second relief well is temporarily suspended and is expected to recommence shortly from 8,576 feet.\n\nSubsea efforts continue to focus on progressing steps to stop the flow of oil from the well through interventions via the failed Deepwater Horizon blow out preventer (BOP), and to collect the flow of oil from the leak points. These efforts are being carried out in conjunction with industry experts and governmental authorities.\n\nOperations on the top kill procedure continue. Heavy drilling fluids were pumped under pressure into the BOP starting 26 May at 1300CDT, and top kill operations continue through 2400CDT on 27 May. It is estimated that the full top kill procedure could extend for another 48 hours.\n\nIf the well were successfully 'killed', it is expected that cementing operations would then follow. The top kill procedure has never before been attempted at these depths and its ultimate success is uncertain.\n\nIn parallel with top kill, preparations have been made for the possible deployment of the lower marine riser package (LMRP) cap containment system.\n\nDeployment would first involve removing the damaged riser from the top of the failed BOP to leave a cleanly-cut pipe at the top of the BOP's LMRP. The cap, a containment device with a sealing grommet, will be connected to a riser from the Discoverer Enterprise drillship, 5,000ft above on the surface, and placed over the LMRP with the intention of capturing most of the oil and gas flowing from the well.\n\nThe LMRP cap is already deployed alongside the BOP in readiness for potential deployment. If it is decided to deploy this option, this would be expected to take some three to four days.\n\nIn addition to these steps, planning is being advanced for deploying, if necessary, a second BOP on top of the original failed BOP.\n\nDrilling of two relief wells began on 2 May and 16 May. It is estimated that each of these wells will take three months to complete from the commencement of drilling.\n\nWork continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea, to protect the shoreline of the Gulf of Mexico, and to collect and clean up any oil that has reached shore.\n\nAlmost 1,300 vessels are now involved in the response effort, including skimmers, tugs, barges and recovery vessels. Operations to skim oil from the surface of the water have now recovered, in total, some 274,000 barrels (11.5 million gallons) of oily liquid.\n\nThe total length of containment boom deployed as part of efforts to prevent oil reaching the coast is now almost 1.9 million feet, and an additional 1.25 million feet of sorbent boom has also been deployed.\n\nSo far 26,000 claims for loss and damage have been filed and 11,650 payments have already been made. BP has received over 96,000 calls into its help lines to date.\n\nPresident Obama extends ban on new deepwater oil drilling permits for wells over 500ft for a further six months.\n\nTop kill is intended to stem the flow of oil and gas and ultimately kill the well by injecting heavy drilling fluids through the blow out preventer on the seabed, down into the well. Pumping started at 19.00 (UK) and 13.00 (CDT) and continues.\n\nThe company has also announced that it will appoint an independent mediator to review and assist in the claims process for the spill associated with the exploratory well that was being drilled by the Transocean Deepwater Horizon in Mississippi Canyon, Block 252.\n\nBP has said consistently that it will pay legitimate claims for loss and damage caused by the spill. BP remains fully committed to responding to and paying claims promptly. To date, more than 26,000 claims already have been submitted, resulting in payments exceeding $36m.\n\n\"We are absolutely committed to a simple, fair claims process that gets funds to people who have been hurt by this disaster as quickly as possible,\" said BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward. \"We have opened claims offices across the region, and will make every effort to reach everyone who has a legitimate claim. And we will appoint an independent mediator so that we have as fair a process as possible for everyone in the Gulf region.\"\n\nPlans have been developed for a series of interventions via the BOP; it is currently anticipated these may be carried out over a period of about a week, commencing in the next few days. These interventions have not been carried out at these depths and conditions before and the success of individual options cannot be assured.\n\nThe first planned intervention is the so-called “top kill” operation where heavy drilling fluids would be injected into the well to stem the flow of oil and gas and, ultimately, kill the well. Most of the equipment is on site and preparations for this operation continue, with a view to deployment within a few days. If necessary, equipment is also in place to combine this operation with the injection under pressure of bridging material to seal off upward flow through the BOP.\n\nSophisticated diagnostic work using remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs) will precede the ‘top kill’ to allow the procedure to be planned in detail. The knowledge from this diagnostic work will be instrumental in determining whether to proceed with this option.\n\nBeing progressed in parallel with plans for the top kill is development of a lower marine riser package (or LMRP) cap containment option. This would first involve removing the damaged riser from the top of the BOP, leaving a cleanly-cut pipe at the top of the BOP’s LMRP. The LMRP cap, an engineered containment device with a sealing grommet, would be connected to a riser from the Discoverer Enterprise drillship and then placed over the LMRP with the intention of capturing most of the oil and gas flowing from the well and transporting it to the drillship on the surface. The LMRP cap is already on site and it is anticipated that this option will be available for deployment by the end of May.\n\nAdditional options also continue to be progressed, including the option of lowering a second blow-out preventer, or a valve, on top of the MC 252 BOP.\n\nBP chief executive Tony Hayward visits the hit area, and announces himself \"devastated\" by what he has seen.\n\nThe oil major also announces that its internal investigation team has begun sharing initial perspectives of its review of the causes of the tragic Deepwater Horizon fire and oil spill. The investigation is a fact-finding effort that has not reached final conclusions, but has identified various issues for further inquiry. BP has shared these early perspectives with the Department of the Interior and will do so with all official regulatory inquiries into the accident as requested.\n\nThis is an internal investigation. There is extensive further work to do - including further interviews, and in addition full forensic examinations of the Blow Out Preventer (BOP), the wellhead, and the rig itself - all of which are still currently on the sea bed. The internal investigation was launched on 21 April 2010 and is being conducted by BP's Head of Group Safety and Operations. He has an independent reporting line to the Group Chief Executive.\n\nThe investigation team’s work thus far shows that this accident was brought about by the failure of a number of processes, systems and equipment. There were multiple control mechanisms— procedures and equipment—in place that should have prevented this accident or reduced the impact of the spill: the investigation is focused on the following seven mechanisms.\n\n\"I understand people want a simple answer about why this happened and who is to blame. The honest truth is that this is a complex accident, caused by an unprecedented combination of failures,\" said Chief Executive Tony Hayward. \"A number of companies are involved, including BP, and it is simply too early – and not up to us – to say who is at fault.\n\n\"This is a basic summary of the facts as gathered by the investigation team to date. A lot remains unknown, but we hope that the briefings will help the government's inquiries. This was a tragic accident and we need to understand the causes of it to try to ensure that nothing like it ever happens again.\"\n\nWork goes on to optimise the oil and gas collected from the damaged riser through the riser insertion tube tool (RITT). The collection rate continues to vary, primarily due to the flow parameters and physical characteristics within the riser.\n\nIn the period from 17-23 May, the daily oil rate collected by the RITT has ranged from 1,360 barrels of oil per day (b/d) to 3,000 b/d, and the daily gas rate has ranged from 4 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) to 17 MMCFD.\n\nIn the same period, the average daily rate of oil and gas collected by the RITT containment system at the end of the leaking riser has been 2,010 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) and 10 MMCFD of gas. The oil is being stored and gas is being flared on the drillship Discoverer Enterprise, on the surface 5,000ft above.\n\nThe RITT remains a new technology and both its continued operation and its effectiveness in capturing the oil and gas remain uncertain.\n\nThe US Government has appointed a flow rate technical team (FRTT) to determine the well flow rate. The FRTT includes the US Coast Guard, NOAA, MMS, Department of Energy and the US Geological Survey. BP will continue to promptly provide all information necessary to make as accurate an assessment as possible of the rate of flow.\n\nWork also continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea. Over 1,100 vessels are involved in the response effort, including skimmers, tugs, barges and recovery vessels.\n\nIntensive operations to skim oil from the surface of the water have now recovered, in total, some 243,000 barrels (10.2 million gallons) of oily liquid. The total length of boom deployed as part of efforts to prevent oil reaching the coast is now nearly 2.5 million feet, including over 730,000ft of sorbent boom.\n\nThe cost of the response to date amounts to about $760m, including the cost of the spill response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to the Gulf states, claims paid and federal costs. It is too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated with the incident.\n\nBP reiterates its pledge to be open and transparent in its response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The company confirms its continuing commitment to cooperate with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in facilitating access by the US Government and the public to sampling/monitoring data on the Deepwater Horizon spill response. The commitment is made in a letter sent to Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Homeland Security and Lisa Jackson, administrator of the EPA.\n\n“We are committed to providing the American people with the information they need to understand the environmental impact from the spill and the response steps that have been taken,” said BP’s chief executive Tony Hayward.\n\n“We share with you a strong commitment to transparency. BP is working hand-in-hand with federal, state and local governments to gather data on the seabed and in the water, and to incorporate those lessons so that we can continually improve the effectiveness of our response efforts,” Hayward added.\n\nBP continues to develop options to shut off the flow of oil from the well through interventions via the failed BOP.\n\nPlans continue to develop a so called 'top kill' operation where heavy drilling fluids are injected into the well to stem the flow of oil and gas, followed by cement to seal the well. Most of the equipment is on site and preparations continue for this operation, with a view to deployment in the next few days. Options have also been developed to potentially combine this with the injection under pressure of a variety of materials into the BOP to seal off upward flow.\n\nWork on the first relief well, which began on 2 May, continues. The DDII drilling rig began drilling the second relief well on 16 May. Each of these wells is estimated to take some three months to complete from the commencement of drilling.\n\nWork continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea. Over 930 vessels are involved in the response effort, including skimmers, tugs, barges and recovery vessels.\n\nIntensive operations to skim oil from the surface of the water have now recovered, in total, some 187,000 barrels (7.8 million gallons) of oily liquid. The total length of boom deployed as part of efforts to prevent oil reaching the coast is now more than 1.9 million feet, including over 500,000ft of sorbent boom.\n\nIn total over 19,000 personnel from BP, other companies and government agencies are currently involved in the response to this incident. So far about 19,000 claims have been filed, and some 8,000 payments have been made.\n\nThe riser insertion tube tool (RITT) containment system that was put into place in the end of the leaking riser is operational. It is estimated to be collecting and carrying about 2,000 barrels a day (b/d) of oil to flow up to the drillship Discoverer Enterprise on the surface 5,000ft above. Produced oil is being stored on the drillship while produced gas is being flared.\n\nIt is expected that it will take some time to increase the flow through the system and maximise the proportion of oil and gas flowing through the broken riser that will be captured and transported to the drillship.\n\nThis remains a new technology and both its continued operation and its effectiveness in capturing the oil and gas remain uncertain. Other containment options continue to be progressed.\n\nThe company also continues to develop options to shut off the flow of oil from the well through interventions via the failed BOP.\n\nPlans continue to develop a so called 'top kill' operation where heavy drilling fluids are injected into the well to stem the flow of oil and gas, followed by cement to seal the well. Most of the equipment is on site and preparations continue for this operation, with a view to deployment in the next week or so. Options have also been developed to potentially combine this with the injection under pressure of a variety of materials into the BOP to seal off upward flow.\n\nWork on the first relief well, which began on May 2, continues. The DDII drilling rig began drilling the second relief well on May 16. Each of these wells is estimated to take some three months to complete from the commencement of drilling.\n\nWork continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea. Over 750 vessels are involved in the response effort, including skimmers, tugs, barges and recovery vessels.\n\nIntensive operations to skim oil from the surface of the water have now recovered, in total, some 158,000 barrels (6.6 million gallons) of oily liquid. The total length of boom deployed as part of efforts to prevent oil reaching the coast is now more than 1.7 million feet, including over 400,000ft of sorbent boom.\n\nBP says a fifth of the oil gushing out is now being captured; company has rebutted allegations that its Atlantis platform in the Gulf of Mexico operated with incomplete and inaccurate engineering documents.\n\nResponding to claims that flawed or missing documentation posed a threat to safe operation of the platform, recently made in various news programmes and print media, BP says it had thoroughly investigated these claims when they were first made by a former contract worker in 2009 and found them to be without substance.\n\nThe investigation found that the operators on the platform had full access to the accurate, up-to-date drawings (topsides, hull and subsea) necessary to operate the platform safely.\n\nA second investigation of the same allegations by the Ombudsman’s office focused on project document and filing procedures and has no bearing on operating or regulatory issues. After this review BP made some procedural changes in the project execution plan, but these likewise had no connection with the safe operation of the platform.\n\n“As CEO Tony Hayward constantly makes clear, safe and reliable operations are his number 1 priority for BP and the company has a very strong record of safe and reliable operations in the Gulf of Mexico,” a company spokesman said. “It is completely erroneous to suggest that the minor internal process issue we identified and immediately amended last year on the Atlantis platform suggests anything different.”\n\nThe design, construction, installation and operation of Atlantis have received a high level of oversight by both the US Minerals Management Service (MMS) and the US Coast Guard. BP has and will continue to work with the MMS or any other regulator when concerns are raised about any aspect of our operation.\n\nThe Atlantis field has been in service since October 2007 and has safely produced many million barrels of oil. The platform was successfully maintained through the course of two major hurricanes in 2008. Its safety, operations and performance record is excellent.\n\nBP starts its latest attempt to stop the leak, using deep-sea robots to put a 6in-wide tube with a rubber stopper into the faulty pipe.\n\nPresident Obama slams the \"ridiculous spectacle\" of oil industry officials pointing the finger of blame at each other.\n\n\"We absolutely understand and share President Obama's sense of urgency over the length of time this complex task is taking,” Tony Hayward, BP Group chief executive, said. “We want to thank the President and his administration for their ongoing engagement in this effort.\n\n\"BP - working closely with scientists and engineers from across the whole oil industry, from government agencies and departments, and with local officials along the Gulf Coast - is focused on doing everything in our power to stop the flow of oil, remove it from the surface, and protect the shoreline. We are working with state and community leaders to mitigate the impact on the lives and livelihoods of those who have been affected.\n\n\"And while we continue in these efforts, we are participating fully in investigations that will provide valuable lessons about how to prevent future incidents of this nature.\"\n\nSubsea efforts continue to focus on, firstly, progressing options to stop the flow of oil from the well through interventions via the blow out preventer (BOP) and, secondly, attempts to contain the flow of oil at source to reduce the amount spreading on the surface. These efforts are  carried out in conjunction with governmental authorities and other industry experts.\n\nFurther investigation of the failed BOP, using remotely-operated vehicles and a variety of diagnostic techniques, increases understanding of the condition of the BOP and allows planning to continue for a number of potential interventions, including for a so-called “top kill” of the well. Plans for this option are being developed in preparation for potential application next week.\n\nWork to deploy a second system designed to contain the oil flow subsea continues. The deployment of this 'top hat' system is expected to be attempted within the next few days.\n\nAll of the techniques being attempted or evaluated to contain the flow of oil on the seabed involve significant uncertainties because they have not been tested in these conditions before.\n\nWork on the first relief well, which began on Sunday 2 May, continues. The drilling rig that will drill the second relief well is en route to the site, expected to arrive by Friday.\n\nWork continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea. Over 530 vessels are involved in the response effort, including skimmers, tugs, barges and recovery vessels.\n\nOver 120 flights have been made to apply dispersant to the spill since the response effort began.\n\nIntensive operations to skim oil from the surface of the water also continue. Some 97,000 barrels of oily liquid have now been recovered.\n\nThe total length of boom deployed as part of efforts to prevent oil reaching the coast is now more than 1.2 million feet, with a further 400,000ft staged in readiness for deployment.\n\nIn total over 13,000 personnel from BP, other companies and government agencies are  involved in the response to this incident. Over 16,000 people have registered to volunteer across four states. So far 6,700 claims have been filed, of which about 1,000 have already been paid. BP has also received 46,500 calls into its help lines, approximately 30 per cent of which have offered ideas to help the response or other assistance.\n\nThe cost to date of the response amounts to about $450m, including the cost of spill response, containment, relief well drilling, commitments to the Gulf Coast States, settlements and federal costs.\n\nBP executives appear before a congressional hearing in Washington. Senate energy committee chairman Jee Bingman says the rig explosion was a result of a \"cascade of errors\".\n\nSubsea efforts continue to focus on two fronts: first, reducing the flow of oil spilled by physical containment and second, further work on stopping the flow using a “top kill” option.\n\nThe containment dome that was deployed last week has been parked away from the spill area on the sea bed. Efforts to place it over the main leak point were suspended at the weekend as a build up of hydrates prevented a successful placement of the dome over the spill area.\n\nA second, smaller containment dome is being readied to lower over the main leak point. The small dome will be connected by drill pipe and riser lines to a drill ship on the surface to collect and treat oil. It is designed to mitigate the formation of large hydrate volumes. This operation has never been done before in 5,000ft of water.\n\nIn addition, further work on the blow out preventer has positioned us to attempt a “top kill” option aimed at stopping the flow of oil from the well. This option will be pursued in parallel with the smaller containment dome over the next two weeks.\n\nAll of the techniques being attempted or evaluated to contain the flow of oil on the seabed involve significant uncertainties because they have not been tested in these conditions before.\n\nThe company continues to do everything it can, in conjunction with governmental authorities and other industry experts, to find a solution to stem the flow of oil on the seabed.\n\nWork on the first relief well, which began on Sunday May 2, continues. It is expected to take some three months to complete.\n\nWork continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea. More than 275 vessels are being used, including skimmers, tugs, barges and recovery vessels.\n\nThe volume of dispersant applied to the spill on the surface amounts to over 315,000 gallons since the spill response began.\n\nIntensive operations to skim oil from the surface of the water also continued. Some 90,000 barrels of oily liquid has now been recovered.\n\nThe total length of deployed boom is now more than 1 million feet as part of the efforts to stop oil reaching the coast.\n\nBP announces it is to attempt to plug the broken pipe with a 'junk shot' consisting of golf balls, bits of tyres and mud.\n\nEfforts to stem the flow suffer a set-back, after crystal build-up within a specially-made 100t steel and concrete containment dome render it too buoyant. The dome had arrived on location from Port Fourchon, Louisiana. Once lowered to the sea bed, the next steps were to be to connect the 40x24x14ft steel dome to a vessel on the surface.\n\nWork on the first relief well, which began on Sunday 2 May, continues. It is expected to take some three months to complete.\n\nWork continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea. More than 260 vessels are being used, including skimmers, tugs, barges and recovery vessels.\n\n18 flights over the spill are carried out during the day and operations to skim oil from the surface of the water also continue as the seas become calmer.\n\nTo date the oil spill response team has recovered about 30,000 barrels of oil-water mix.\n\nThe total length of deployed boom is now over 700,000ft as part of the efforts to stop oil reaching the coast. Some one million feet is available and more than 300,000ft is on order.\n\nA BP-led effort to address shoreline clean-up continues. More than 4,000 people have been trained, out of about 30,000 volunteers, to deal with oil as it comes onshore.\n\nWork continues to attempt to bring the MC252 oil well under control, to stop the flow of oil and to contain the oil subsea. A valve that had been attached to the end of a broken drill pipe, one of the three points from which oil was leaking, was closed. This has stopped the flow from this point, but is not expected to affect the overall rate of flow from the well. BP continues to use remotely operated vehicles to monitor the flow of oil from the other two leak points.\n\nA containment dome is loaded aboard a transport vessel at Port Fourchon, Louisiana, and begins its transport to the MC252 well site. The 40x24x14 feet steel vessel, which weighs almost 100 tons, is expected to be lowered to the seabed today.\n\nThe drilling of the first relief well, which began on Sunday May 2, continues. It is estimated that it will take some three months to complete.\n\nWork continues to collect and disperse oil that has reached the surface of the sea and to protect the shoreline.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, 12 flights over the spill had been completed, delivering a total of 34,000 gallons of dispersant. During the day further in situ burning of oil on the surface of the water was carried out.\n\n80,000ft of boom is deployed during the day. This brings the total length of boom now deployed to protect the shore to over 100 miles.\n\nMore than 11,000 people have so far volunteered to assist in efforts to protect the coastline and in the clean up of any spill. More than 4,000 have already received training.\n\nBP announces it has stopped the flow of oil from one of the three existing leak points on the damaged MC252 oil well and riser in the Gulf of Mexico. While this is not expected to affect the overall rate of flow from the well, it is expected to reduce the complexity of the situation being dealt with on the seabed.\n\nSeparately, BP announces that it has made $25m block grants to each of the states of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida to help accelerate the implementation of Area Contingency Plans (ACPs). These approved plans address the removal of a worst case spill and are designed to mitigate or prevent a substantial threat to sensitive areas. The grants BP has made to the four states do not affect BP's MC252 response or existing claims process, but are supplemental to them and are intended to enable local businesses to support clean-up and recovery efforts. Each state will administer its $25m grant.\n\nTony Hayward, BP Group chief executive: \"We are continuing to do all we can to stop the flow of oil from the well and also attack and capture the spilled oil offshore. However, it is also vital that we work together with government and potentially impacted communities to protect the shoreline from any impact of the spill. We hope these grants will support the effective deployment of pre-prepared response plans in each state.\"\n\nAt the MC252 well, using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), a valve is installed on the end of a broken drill pipe, one of the three points from which oil was leaking. The ROVs first cut the end of the pipe to leave a clean end and the valve, weighing over half a ton, was placed in position on the seabed. Overnight the ROVs completed securely joining the valve to the broken drill pipe and then closed it, shutting off the flow from that pipe. The ROVs will continue to closely monitor the well and remaining flow points to look for any changes.\n\nBP continues to make plans for the loading and movement of a first containment dome from dock at Port Fourchon, Louisiana out to the well site. It is planned to lower the dome over one of the leak sites on the seabed and then connect it by pipe to a specialist vessel at the surface. This system is designed to help capture the oil at the seabed and collect it securely for processing. The dome is currently expected to be lowered to the wellsite seabed in around three days' time allowing the process of testing and commissioning to begin. Only once this is complete will the effectiveness of the system be demonstrated.\n\nBP's initial onshore response efforts focused on Louisiana, and rapidly expand with equipment and people staged and ready in Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. BP positions rapid response teams in Mobile, Alabama and Houma, Louisiana, to enable quick response and cleaning of areas where oil may come ashore. These 12-person teams will assess initial impacts, and then call in a larger contingent of trained responders and volunteers to clean the affected area. BP is also setting up a Rapid Response Team for Chandeleur Island.\n\nIn addition, BP has been hosting town hall meetings in Gulf Coast communities for those who wish to volunteer on a cleanup crew or to volunteer their vessels for marine work. More than 2,000 volunteers have been signed up and trained by BP.\n\nBP has a supply of boom and other resources on hand to cover the next seven to ten days of planned response activity, and has put in place a supply chain that should enable it to deliver additional supplies as needs arise. There are now nine staging areas across the Gulf Coast - four in Louisiana and three in Mississippi, and one each in Alabama and Florida.\n\nBP announces that work has begun to drill a relief well to intercept and isolate the oil well that is spilling oil in the US Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe drilling began at 15:00CDT (21:00BST) on Sunday 2 May. The new well, in 5,000ft of water, is planned to intercept the existing well around 13,000ft below the seabed and permanently seal it. The new drill site is about half a mile on the seabed from the leaking well in Mississippi Canyon block 252, and drilling is estimated to take some three months.\n\nBP Group Chief Executive Tony Hayward: \"This is another key step in our work to permanently stop the loss of oil from the well. At the same time we are continuing with our efforts to stop the leak and control the oil at the seabed, to tackle the oil offshore, and to protect the shoreline through a massive effort together with government agencies and local communities.\"\n\nThe company also carries out a second approved trial injection of dispersants directly into the oil flow at a point close to the main leak on the seabed. The technique is intended to efficiently mix the oil and dispersant, breaking up and dispersing accumulations of oil and allowing it to degrade naturally and reduce surface impact. The suggestion for this innovative technique came from the companies across the oil industry that BP approached last week for further ideas and expertise to help BP control the well and tackle the spill.\n\nRapid progress is also reported in constructing a coffer dam, or containment canopy. A 14 x 24 x 40 foot steel canopy has already been fabricated and other-sized canopies are under construction and being sourced. Once lowered over the leak site and connected by pipe, the canopy is designed to channel the flow of oil from the subsea to the surface where it could be processed and stored safely on board a specialist vessel. Weather permitting, first installation of a canopy on site is expected to start in a little over a week, allowing the process of testing and commissioning to begin. Only once this is complete will the effectiveness of the system be demonstrated.\n\nAt the seabed, BP continues to use up to eight remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to work on the blow-out preventer and subsea equipment.\n\nAccurate estimation of the rate of flow is difficult, but  estimates by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) suggest some 5,000 barrels (210,000 US gallons) of oil per day are escaping from the well.\n\nOn the surface, weather hampers surface operations over the weekend but is forecast to improve in coming days. BP currently has 230,000 gallons of dispersant available to deploy once the sea state is calm enough and a further 208,000 gallons on order. Offshore booms and specialist oil spill response vessels, skimmers and barges will return to operation in calmer seas, treating and collecting as much oil as possible before it reaches the coast.\n\nThe onshore activity is focused on six locations in the potentially affected states: Venice and Port Sulphur, Louisiana; Pascagoula and Biloxi, Mississippi; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida. Staging posts are in place stocked with people and material to help protect the shoreline in each area. Work is continuing to install marine protection booms along the coast. Hundreds of thousands of feet of boom have been deployed and, to date, 2,000 volunteers have been trained to assist in the response effort.\n\nWhilst difficult to accurately estimate, the cost to the MC252 owners of the efforts to contain the spill and secure the well is currently estimated to be more than $6m per day. This figure is rising as activity increases. It is too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated with the incident.\n\nBP's chief executive Tony Hayward states  it is BP's \"responsibility to deal with the leak and to clean up the oil\", and adds that \"This was not our accident.\"\n\nThe company stresses that, contrary to some media reports, the actions it has taken to date on the blow out preventer have not resulted in any observed reduction in the rate of flow of oil from the MC252 well.\n\nIn a sepetate matter BP chief executive Tony Hayward replies to President Obama: \"The US government leadership here has been excellent since day one. I agree with the President that the top priority right now is to stop the leak and mitigate the damage. I reiterated my commitment to the White House today that BP will do anything and everything we can to stop the leak, attack the spill off shore, and protect the shorelines of the Gulf Coast.\n\n\"We appreciate the tireless efforts of the many federal, state and local responders and the volunteers, men and women who have worked tirelessly since the date of the accident to mitigate the damage. Our teams are working hand in hand and we look forward to hearing more recommendations for action from the President's visit today.\"\n\nPresident Obama visits the region for the first time since the disaster, vows BP will pay for the \"massive\" damage caused, and warns of a \"potentially unprecedented environmental disaster\".\n\nBP's chairman Lamar McKay tell ABC's 'This Week' that \"a failed piece of equipment\" was to blame for the blast. He adds that engineers are working on a dome to be placed over the the well in six to eight days.\n\nDocuments emerge showing that BP downplayed the chances of a catastrophic accident at Deepwater Horizon. A 52-page exploration plan repeatedly states that it was virtually impossible for such an explosion to take place.\n\nPresident Obama orders  no new offshore oil drilling leases will be issued unless companies can prove that a repeat of the slick is impossible.\n\nBP continues to ramp up its response to the oil spill in the US Gulf of Mexico. Over 2,500 personnel are now involved in the response effort and well-advanced preparations are being made for a major protection and cleaning effort on the shorelines of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. A fourth onshore command centre, in Mobile, Alabama, opens.\n\nTony Hayward, BP Group chief executive: \"In the past few days I have seen the full extent of BP's global resources and capability being brought to bear on this problem, and welcome the offers of further assistance we have had from government agencies, oil companies and members of the public to defend the shoreline and fight this spill. We will be judged by the success we have in dealing with this incident and we are determined to succeed.\"\n\nWork progresses to install marine protection booms along the coast. As well as almost 220,000ft of boom already in the water, an additional 300,000ft is staged or in the process of being deployed, with more on the way.\n\nThe onshore activity focuses on five locations in the potentially affected states: Venice, Louisiana; Pascagoula and Biloxi, Mississippi; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida. Staging posts are in place stocked with people and material, including about 100,000ft of boom, to protect the shoreline in each area. A sixth staging post is set up in Port Sulphur, Louisiana.\n\nHayward adds: \"BP is fully committed to taking all possible steps to contain the spread of the oil spill. We are taking full responsibility for the spill and we will clean it up, and where people can present legitimate claims for damages we will honour them.\"\n\nBP continues to attack the spill on many fronts - making continuing attempts to prevent oil escaping from the subsea well, 5,000ft below the surface; collecting and separating the oil which enters the water; deploying innovative technology to disperse the oil at its seabed source; and drilling a relief well to permanently isolate and secure the leaking well.\n\nIn parallel, at the surface, BP's response expands to mobilise shoreline protection teams and equipment, and numbers of community liaison staff, while planning for in-situ burning several miles offshore. BP calls on expertise from other companies including Exxon, Shell, Chevron and Anadarko to help it activate the blow out preventer, and to offer technical support on other aspects of the response.\n\nBP announces that it has launched the next phase of its effort to contain and clean up the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, with a significant expansion of onshore preparations in case spilled oil should reach the coast.\n\nThe company ramps up preparations for a major protection and cleaning effort on the shorelines of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. To supplement its Houma, Louisiana incident command post, which oversees the offshore containment effort and onshore response in Louisiana, BP is now establishing a similar onshore incident command post in Mobile, Alabama to oversee the onshore response in Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.\n\nWork will continue to complete installing marine protection booms along the coast. As well as 180,000ft of boom already in the water, an additional 300,000ft is staged or in the process of being deployed, with more on the way.\n\nBP is mobilising its full resources to fight the oil spill. This includes efforts to stem the flow of oil into the water from the sub-sea well, to contain the spill offshore and to protect the Gulf coast.\n\nBP Group chief executive Tony Hayward: \"We are doing absolutely everything in our power to eliminate the source of the leak and contain the environmental impact of the spill. We are determined to fight this spill on all fronts, in the deep waters of the Gulf, in the shallow waters and, should it be necessary, on the shore.\"\n\n\"In the past few days I have seen the full extent of BP's global resources and capability being brought to bear on this problem, and welcome the offers of further assistance we have had from government agencies, oil companies and members of the public to defend the shoreline and fight this spill. We are determined to succeed.\"\n\nThe offshore operation has been addressing the spill on the surface offshore, both by skimming and collecting oil and by applying dispersants. There is concern, however, that weather and current patterns will shift and move the sheen closer to shore or onshore in the coming days.\n\nThe new onshore activity focuses on five locations in the potentially affected states: Venice, Louisiana; Pascagoula and Biloxi, Mississippi; Mobile, Alabama; and Pensacola, Florida. Staging posts are in place stocked with people and material, including about 100,000ft of boom, to protect the shoreline in each area.\n\nEach of the states has oil spill response plans already in place and trained community groups and volunteers will also be available to aid the response to the oil spill and deploy resources.\n\nParallel to these, BP sets up offices in each of these communities manned by company staff to provide information on what is happening, what is being done and any developments. These will connect with local government officials, community and other groups to provide information on developments.\n\nEfforts to stem the flow of oil from the well, currently estimated at up to 5,000 barrels a day, continue with six remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs) attempting to activate the blow out preventer (BOP) on the sea bed.\n\nBy this weekend the Transocean Development Driller III is scheduled to spud a relief well intended to secure the existing well. Drilling of this well is expected to take two to three months.\n\nWork continues to produce a subsea collection system capable of operating in deep water to funnel leaking oil to the surface for treatment. This is expected to be ready for deployment in the next few weeks.\n\nPreliminary estimates indicate that current efforts to contain the spill and secure the well are costing the MC252 owners about $6m per day. This figure is expected to rise as activity increases. It is too early to quantify other potential costs and liabilities associated with the incident.\n\nBP, operating with the US Coast Guard and other agencies, conducts a controlled burn on parts of an offshore oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as it continues to escalate its response plan.\n\nTony Hayward, BP Group chief executive: \"We are attacking this spill on all fronts, bringing into play all and any resources and advanced technologies we believe can help. Our action plan is safety-focused, multi-layered and has the full resources of the BP Group behind it.\n\n\"The scale of the surface response is truly unprecedented, both for BP and for the oil industry. At the seabed, we are applying all the resources available to us and also developing and adapting advanced technology to address this complex problem.\"\n\nOn the surface, BP continues to aggressively move forward with its oil spill plan. BP launches its comprehensive, pre-approved oil spill response plan.\n\nImproved weather for vessels and aircraft is aiding in the dispersion of the sheen that comprises the vast majority of the spill and is enabling skimming vessels to operate far offshore and aircraft to fly multiple dispersant sorties. Weathering and dispersion tactics are breaking down the oil into a frothy emulsion. Fire boom has also been deployed to contain and burn heavier pockets of oil. The latest response numbers are:\n\nBP works closely with Gulf Coast state environmental officials to implement an extensive shoreline protection plan. This includes deployment of more than 100,000ft of boom over the last two days to minimize impact to sensitive areas in the Mississippi River Delta area. Staging areas are also in place and ready to protect sensitive shorelines. These areas include: Biloxi, Miss., Pensacola, Fla. Venice, La., Pascagoula, Miss., and Theodore, Ala.\n\nBP, as operator of the MC252 lease, continues to work around the clock on Transocean’s subsea equipment. Remotely-operated vehicles monitor the well and riser. Monitoring has detected an additional leak on the riser closer to the well. ROVs also continue to methodically work through procedures aimed at subsea activation of the blow-out preventer on the MC252 well.\n\nIn parallel with these offshore efforts, advanced engineering design and fabrication of a subsea oil collection system has started onshore. This will be the first time this proven shallow water technology has been adapted for the deepwater. It is expected to be ready for deployment within the next four weeks.\n\nBP also today began preparations to drill a relief well into the MC252 exploration well following the arrival on site of the Transocean Development Driller III. Drilling plans have been approved by the US Minerals Management Service. A second drilling ship, Transocean’s Discoverer Enterprise, is also on its way to the site with plans being developed for a second relief well should it be necessary.\n\nPreliminary estimates indicate that current efforts to contain the spill and secure the well are costing the MC252 owners about $6m per day. This figure is expected to rise as activity increases. BP has a 65 percent interest in MC252.\n\nUS coastguard estimates that the pipeline is leaking 5,000 barrels per day, five times the quantity initially thought.\n\nBP today announced its support for and cooperation with US government investigations arising from the sinking of the Transocean drilling rig Deepwater Horizon in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (MC252) in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBP Group Chief Executive Tony Hayward: \"Losing 11 of our industry colleagues is a tragedy for the offshore community. As an industry, we must participate fully in these investigations and not rest until the causes of this tragedy are known and measures are taken to see that it never happens again.\"\n\nThe Department of the Interior and Department of Homeland Security announced a joint enquiry into the explosion and sinking of the Transocean Deepwater Horizon on April 22. The US House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources have also announced investigations.\n\nLast week BP launched its own investigation into the incident and has an investigation team at work in Houston, Texas.\n\nBP accelerates offshore oil recovery and continues well control efforts in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (MC252) following improvements in weather conditions in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBP Group Chief Executive Tony Hayward: \"The safety of the people working offshore is our top priority and the improved weather has created better conditions for our response. This, combined with the light, thin oil we are dealing with has further increased our confidence that we can tackle this spill offshore.\"\n\nBP, operating with the US Coast Guard and other agencies, launches its comprehensive, pre-approved oil spill response plan.\n\nAccording to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) experts participating in the spill response, the spill is \"very thin\" and consists of \"97 per cent sheen.\"\n\nIn Houma, Louisiana where the field operations response is being coordinated, more than 1,000 personnel on and offshore are deployed to coordinate the oil spill response.\n\nBP, as lease operator of MC252, also continues to work below the surface on Transocean’s subsea equipment using remotely operated vehicles to monitor the Macondo/MC252 exploration well, and is working to activate the blow-out preventer.\n\nThe Transocean drilling rig Development Driller III will arrive on location today to drill the first of two relief wells to permanently secure the well. A second drilling rig, Transocean’s Discoverer Enterprise, is en route.\n\nBP, as lease operator of Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (MC252), continues to forge ahead with a comprehensive oil well intervention and spill response plan following the 22 April sinking.\n\nBP Group chief executive Tony Hayward is in Texas and Louisiana to meet with response personnel: “We are attacking this spill on two fronts – at the wellhead and on the surface offshore. The team on the ground and those at sea have the Group’s full resources behind them.”\n\nBP continues to assist Transocean’s work below the surface on the subsea equipment, using remotely operated vehicles to monitor the Macondo/MC252 exploration well, and plans and mobilises to activate the blow-out preventer.\n\nBP prepares to drill relief wells to permanently secure the well. The drilling rig Development Driller III moves into position to drill a second well to intercept the Macondo well and inject a specialised heavy fluid to securely prevent flow of oil or gas and allow work to be carried out to permanently seal the well.\n\nThe oil spill response team has recovered more than 1,000 barrels of an oil-water mix, of which the vast majority is water. The material has been collected by skimming vessels and vessels towing containment boom. Dispersants have also been applied to the spill. Equipment available for the effort includes:\n\nIn Houma, La. where the field operations response is being coordinated, almost 500 personnel on- and offshore have already been deployed to coordinate the oil spill response. BP’s team of operational and technical experts are working in coordination with several agencies, organisations and companies including United States Coast Guard, Minerals Management Service, Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US Fish & Wildlife Service, Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries, and Marine Spill Response Corporation. More teams have been mobilized in Houston and New Orleans to support the effort.\n\nSteve Benz, President and CEO of the Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC): “At BP's request we are mounting the single, largest response effort in MSRC’s 20-year history. The many years of working together with BP on drills and exercises has proved invaluable to us as we move forward on this response effort.\"\n\nBP chief executive Tony Hayward: “Given the current conditions and the massive size of our response, we are confident in our ability to tackle this spill offshore.”\n\nAlong with the response teams in action, additional resources, both people and equipment, continue to arrive for staging throughout the Gulf states in preparation for deployment should they be needed.\n\nFollowing the fire, Deepwater Horizon sinks, leaving a five-mile oil slick. BP activates an extensive oil spill response in the US Gulf of Mexico.\n\nBP assists Transocean in an assessment of the well and subsea blow out preventer with remotely operated vehicles. The company  also initiates a plan for the drilling of a relief well, if required. A nearby drilling rig will be used to drill the well. The rig is available to begin activity immediately.\n\nBP mobilises a flotilla of vessels and resources that includes:\n\nPresident Barack Obama is briefed and the US administration states that it is monitoring developments.\n\nGroup Chief Executive Tony Hayward: \"We are determined to do everything in our power to contain this oil spill and resolve the situation as rapidly, safely and effectively as possible. We have assembled and are now deploying world-class facilities, resources and expertise, and can call on more if needed. There should be no doubt of our resolve to limit the escape of oil and protect the marine and coastal environments from its effects.\"\n\nIt is revealed that, as part of its planning and approval requirement prior to offshore activity, the area was evaluated for use of dispersants and the plans approved by the US Coast Guard which has now given the go-ahead for their use.\n\nBP offers its full support to drilling contractor Transocean Ltd and its employees after fire caused Transocean's semisubmersible drilling rig Deepwater Horizon to be evacuated overnight, saying it stood ready to assist in any way in responding to the incident.\n\nGroup Chief Executive Tony Hayward says: \"Our concern and thoughts are with the rig personnel and their families. We are also very focused on providing every possible assistance in the effort to deal with the consequences of the incident.\"\n\nBP, which operates the licence on which Transocean's rig was drilling an exploration well, says it is working closely with Transocean and the US Coast Guard, which is leading the emergency response, and offering its help, including logistical support.\n\nTransocean had reported the fire on Mississippi Canyon block 252, saying that a \"substantial majority\" of the 126 personnel on board were safe, but some crew members remained unaccounted for. A number of personnel were reported to be injured.\n\nTransocean's Emergency and Family Response Teams reported to be working with the US Coast Guard and lease operator BP Exploration & Production, Inc. to care for all rig personnel and search for missing rig personnel.\n\n\"A substantial majority of the 126 member crew is safe but some crew members remain unaccounted for at this time. Injured personnel are receiving medical treatment as necessary. The names and hometowns of injured persons are being withheld until family members can be notified.”\n\nAn explosion takes place on BP's Deepwater Horizon rig, at approximately 10:00pm central time, 42 miles off the coast of Louisiana. Eleven workers lose their lives in the blast, around 100 others are evacuated.\n\nBP officials inform federal regulators that they are struggling with a loss of 'well control', following problems on the rig that included drilling mud falling into the formation, sudden gas releases and a pipe falling into the well.\n\nDeepwater Horizon drilling rig begins drilling on the Macondo Prospect, aiming to drill a well 18,000ft below sea level.\n\nThe Transocean Marianas semi-submersible rig begins drilling the Macondo well.\n\nMark E Hafle, a senior drilling engineer at BP, warns in an internal report that the metal casing for the blowout preventer might collapse under high pressure.\n\nBP files an exploration and environmental impact plan for the Macondo well, located in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 in the United States sector of the Gulf of Mexico. The plan states that it is \"unlikely that an accidental surface or subsurface oil spill would occur from the proposed activities\". In the event of an accident, the plan states that due to the well being 48 miles from shore and the response capabilities that would be implemented, no significant adverse impacts would be expected. The Department of the Interior exempts BP's Gulf of Mexico drilling operation from a detailed environmental impact study after concluding that a massive oil spill is unlikely.",

reported as a blowout a blowout is when abnormal pressure from the well rises upwards through the pipes and ignites it is still too early to fully gauge the economic impact some experts are predicting huge economic fallout the harte research institute for gulf of mexico studies in corpus christi are estimating a 16 billion annual loss for tourism fishing and even less tangible services like the

for the current crisis in the gulf of mexico the offshore rigs of today are far better at reducing their footprints on our environment it is ironic however that gingrichs paper being wholly for offshore drilling mentions items that negatively affects fish mammals and the fishing industry with regards to the current oil spill in the gulf of mexico jacqueline savitz a senior scientist at oceana a nonprofit environmental group says that spills are bad for marine life as soon as it hits the water you have endangered sea turtles the larvae of bluefin tuna shrimp and crabs and oysters grouper broder et al spill size doesnt matter there are various factors that can determine the damage caused by an oil spill location timing and ecological vulnerabilities all play a part the 1993 braer spill off the uk which released almost 600000 barrels only resulted in sublethal impacts in gray seals compared to the high mortalities following the smaller exxon valdez spill as such smaller spills can cause significant environmental damage gingrich 5 before you can drill you need to explore oil companies use what is called seismic testing to locate potential traps in the ocean floor that could produce oil even with such testing the certainty of finding oil is not known until you drill its really a crap shoot even seismic activities have been shown to have adverse effects on the fishing industry according to gingrichs paper most of the literature that he has found points to a decrease in local fish due to seismic testing this can have a very real economic impact to local markets people involved in the fishing industry have complained that they are getting smaller catches of fish due to geophysical surveys a scientific study was conducted that supports this theory using air guns gingrich 1112 studies also suggest that mammals are also affected by seismic activities this is yet another example of how mankinds lust for oil has a profound impact on our marine life there are scientists that believe seismic surveys damage the hearing of marine mammals and mask important sounds such as contact calls one scientist goes so far as to say seismic surveys represent the most severe acoustic insult to the marine environment i can imagine short of naval warfare quoted in gingrich 12 its been found that a zone of many kilometers around a seismic source had caused behavioral impacts on mammals including communication finding food or avoiding predators we can clearly discern from these sources the high risk to marine life and the coastal ecosystem how frail they are and the long term effects of such damage perhaps one day this geopolitical topic will unite scientists from both sides to come together and create a defacto standard to be used as a baseline by the oil industry in safeguarding our world or to reduce our footprints on it benefits from lower gas prices are marginal at best it takes years to find potential drilling sites and obtain contracts and permits according to the opinion of charles clusen director of national parks and alaska projects for the natural resources defense council gas prices would decrease by three cents twenty years from now nixon 3 eliminating our dependency on foreign oil with domestic offshore drilling is not a viable solution google searches and emails claim that the bakken formation located in the dakotas and montana is the worlds largest oil reserve this is simply not true the truth is that the us potentially has eight hundred billion barrels of oil shale the technology to extract such oil is not yet commercially viable and even then production of one million barrels per day is probably more than twenty years away bank 1 even so its unclear if market prices would support such an endeavor it can be difficult to discern credible information from opinions this in turn makes the debate more challenging there is an online editorial at readingeaglecom that appears factual however it is misleading according to the article the proposal to lift the ban on offshore drilling by president obama is nothing more than pillow talk to republicans in hopes that they will support his capandtrade energy policy the article also claims that obamas executive order is hot air because of a three decade congressional ban on offshore drilling in fact obamas proposal is to lift the congressional ban the article also noted that coastal areas would only be able to produce 18 billion barrels of oil a decade from now and that the us consumes over 21 million barrels a day using those numbers we would only have enough oil to last approximately 29 months this is hardly a solution to our energy crisis the article appears to be using the department of energy as a source however it is not cited with all of the risk and little return it seems that we really need alternatives to our energy problems we learn in high school biology how every animal big and small is affected by the other we are all interconnected that way to ensure the balance is kept and not jeopardize our food supply we need alternatives we only need to look around to see societys impact on the world smog depleted rain forest global warming toxic waste dumps etc i hope that for those who chant drill baby drill will wake up and look beyond the oil industry and see our future on the horizon there are alternatives that are worth our exploration nuclear energy wind turbines and solar power are just a few perhaps one day we will harness the power of the sea to give us green energy without harmful side effects there is a substantial investment in time money and resources to find and produce oil we find it a wise and prudent endeavor to channel our efforts into green technologies and save whats left of our world our

Recently, President Barack Obama proposed to open vast expanses of water along the Atlantic coastline, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and the north coast of Alaska.\n\nOffshore drilling raises many questions. What are the environmental risks of offshore drilling? What effects will this have at the gas pump? Can we eliminate our dependency on foreign oil? While there are no definitive answers, there is persuasive evidence that oil spills can cause substantial risk to our ecosystem, which can have negative effects on the food chain. Even oil wells that operate safely are of concern as they remain a constant source of pollution. We would not see any short term reduction in gas prices as it takes years for new drilling rigs to become operational. America simply can not produce more than it consumes. In the end, the risk far outweighs the rewards.\n\nResearching the environmental impact of oil spills is a daunting task. Government studies and scientific journals on the subject are full of high level data that requires patience for the average reader to understand. One area of concern seems to involve polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or \"PAH\". PAH is composed of benzene rings that can be used to identify the source of toxins. (Renner, 2092)\n\nSurprisingly, Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the house, has a working paper on offshore drilling. In Gingrich's paper he lists a host of sources, government studies, commissions, and scientific research papers.\n\nPAH can be found in \"produced water\", which is water that is extracted with oil, chemically cleaned and dumped back into the sea. PAH is also derived from burning oil and coal, as well as other combustible sources, which are routinely discharged. (Gingrich, 7)\n\nAccording to Jeff Short, a supervisory researcher for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), due to the paucity of baseline studies, the true environmental impact of oil drilling is hard to study. Animals can flush out PAH. However, their immune response can lead to cancer if they are steadily exposed due to living near an oil platform. It should be noted that Mr. Short does not reference a source for his comments; however, he is considered a subject matter expert. Short goes on to say, in high concentration, PAH is deadly. In low concentration, per lab experiments, birth defects, impaired growth, and skewed sexes were reported. It is also interesting to note that oil spreads on water at a rate of one-half a football field per second. (Nixon, 2)\n\nThe Exxon Valdez oil spill that occurred on March 24th, 1989 in Alaska's Prince William Sound is unfortunately the most famous, on-going, \"research studies\" of all. Twenty years later, we can still find oil on beaches of Prince William Sound. Over 35,000 birds were lost due to the spill alone, not counting other animals, according to the National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. (20 Years, 2)\n\nIn 2001, Jeff Short led a team of scientists who uncovered a potential link between long-term damages and oil spills. Before the finding, oil spills were generally regarded as short term disasters, only affecting beaches at the surface. They found substantial amounts of oil, buried beneath the surface of some of the beaches that had been heavily oiled by the Exxon Valdez's spill. (Renner, 1092) In a separate study by Jeff Short and other scientists, they found that oil from the Exxon Valdez had persisted for 16 years. Annualized loss rates were 68%/yr prior to 1992 and 4%/yr after 2001. Weathering processes diminished in oil sediments and residual emulsified oil, \"oil mousse\". PAH was still found in their tests. The results indicate that subsurface oil may persist for decades with little change. (Short et al, 1)\n\nAs you can imagine, local economies that depend on tourist and fishing are drastically affected by such damage to the ecosystem. Currently, this is the topic on everyone's mind. As reported in the NY Times. On April 20, 2010, an explosion occurred on BP's oil rig, Deepwater Horizon. The explosion is widely reported as a blowout. A blowout is when abnormal pressure from the well rises upwards through the pipes and ignites. It is still too early to fully gauge the economic impact. Some experts are predicting huge economic fallout. The Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies in Corpus Christi are estimating a $1.6 billion annual loss for tourism, fishing and even less tangible services like the storm protection provided by wetlands. As of May 3, 2010 it is estimated that 210,000 gallons of oil is pouring into the Gulf of Mexico (Broder et al, 3)\n\nWhat about today's offshore drilling industry? Except for the current crisis in the Gulf of Mexico, the offshore rigs of today are far better at reducing their footprints on our environment. It is ironic, however, that Gingrich's paper, being wholly for offshore drilling, mentions items that negatively affects fish, mammals and the fishing industry.\n\nWith regards to the current oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Jacqueline Savitz, a senior scientist at Oceana, a nonprofit environmental group, says that spills are bad for marine life as soon as it hits the water. You have endangered sea turtles, the larvae of bluefin tuna, shrimp and crabs and oysters, grouper.\" (Broder, et al)\n\nSpill size doesn't matter. There are various factors that can determine the damage caused by an oil spill; location, timing and ecological vulnerabilities all play a part. The 1993 Braer spill off the U.K., which released almost 600,000 barrels, only resulted in sublethal impacts in gray seals compared to the high mortalities following the smaller Exxon Valdez spill, as such, smaller spills can cause significant environmental damage. (Gingrich, 5)\n\nBefore you can drill, you need to explore. Oil companies use what is called seismic testing to locate potential \"traps\" in the ocean floor that could produce oil. Even with such testing, the certainty of finding oil is not known until you drill; it's really a crap shoot.\n\nEven Seismic activities have been shown to have adverse effects on the fishing industry. According to Gingrich's paper, most of the literature that he has found points to a decrease in local fish due to seismic testing. This can have a very real economic impact to local markets. People involved in the fishing industry have complained that they are getting smaller catches of fish due to geophysical surveys. A scientific study was conducted that supports this theory using air guns. (Gingrich 11-12)\n\nStudies also suggest that mammals are also affected by seismic activities. This is yet another example of how mankind's lust for oil has a profound impact on our marine life. There are scientists that believe seismic surveys damage the hearing of marine mammals and mask important sounds, such as contact calls. One scientist goes so far as to say, \"Seismic surveys represent the most severe acoustic insult to the marine environment I can imagine short of naval warfare -- \" quoted in, (Gingrich, 12) It's been found that a zone of many kilometers around a seismic source had caused behavioral impacts on mammals, including communication, finding food or avoiding predators.\n\nWe can clearly discern from these sources the high risk to marine life and the coastal ecosystem, how frail they are and the long term effects of such damage.\n\nPerhaps one day this geo-political topic will unite scientists from both sides to come together and create a de-facto standard, to be used as a baseline by the oil industry in safeguarding our world or to reduce our footprints on it.\n\nBenefits from lower gas prices are marginal at best. It takes years to find potential drilling sites and obtain contracts and permits. According to the opinion of Charles Clusen, director of National Parks and Alaska Projects for the Natural Resources Defense Council, gas prices would decrease by three cents, twenty years from now. (Nixon 3)\n\nEliminating our dependency on foreign oil with domestic offshore drilling is not a viable solution. Google searches and emails claim that the Bakken Formation, located in the Dakotas and Montana, is the world's largest oil reserve. This is simply not true. The truth is that the U.S. potentially has eight hundred billion barrels of oil shale. The technology to extract such oil is not yet commercially viable, and even then, production of one million barrels per day is probably more than twenty years away. (Bank, 1) Even so, it's unclear if market prices would support such an endeavor.\n\nIt can be difficult to discern credible information from opinions.

Nuclear energy, wind turbines and solar power are just a few. Perhaps one day we will harness the power of the sea to give us green energy without harmful side effects. There is a substantial investment in time, money and resources, to find and produce oil.

off the coast of new orleans in a bid to stem what president obama called a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster the effort comes as the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said the oil slick appears to be drifting toward the alabama and florida coasts including the chandeleur islands off louisianas southern tip president obama visited louisiana on sunday afternoon for a firsthand look at the response effort while officials for bp described in detail their desperate efforts to seal the gushing well the oil that is still leaking from the well could seriously damage the economy and the environment of our gulf states and it could extend for a long time mr obama said it could jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of americans who call this place home on monday bp said it would pay all necessary and appropriate cleanup costs from the disaster bp takes responsibility for responding to the deepwater horizon oil spill we will clean it up the company said in a statement bp was leasing the deepwater horizon oil rig that exploded on april 20 two days later it collapsed into the gulf and the oil began leaking bp working with an array of government agencies and private companies has been unable to stop the flow of crude from the well bob fryar the companys senior vice president for operations in angola who was brought to a command center in houston for the engineering effort said that on monday bp hoped to install a shutoff valve on one of the three leaks that may stop some of the oil flow mr fryar said but the biggest leak at the end of the riser pipe which mr fryar said was the source of most of the spewing oil can not be shut off this way the company intends to address that leak by lowering a containment dome over it and then pumping the oil to the surface that effort is still at least six days away mr fryar said another containment dome for the third leak which is on the riser near the wellhead would follow two to four days after the first the root of the problem appears to be a towering stack of heavy equipment 5000 feet below the surface of the gulf known as a blowout preventer it is a steelframed stack of valves rams housings tanks and hydraulic tubing that is designed to seal the well quickly in the event of a burst of pressure it did not work when the deepwater horizon oil rig exploded mr fryar and charlie holt bps drilling operations manager for the gulf described an audacious plan to confront the blowout preventer problem in this approach they would seal the well by cutting the riser at the wellhead sliding a huge piece of equipment called the riser package out of the way and bolting a second blowout preventer atop the first one the risk in attempting such a maneuver — which would be performed as all the undersea work has been by robotic submersibles tethered to support ships 5000 feet above — is that the pressure of the oil rising from the well could be overwhelming and the well could gush oil at a far higher rate mr fryar said a pressure gauge would be installed soon to determine if it was safe to attempt the operation speaking of the accident mr fryar said the blowout preventer has lots of redundancies there are lots of opportunities to shut these off none of these worked whether the equipment was faulty or it was damaged in the accident was unclear officials still plan to drill relief wells which would allow crews to plug the gushing cavity with heavy liquid drilling of a first relief well was set to begin as soon as the weather clears mr fryar said drilling for a second well was expected to begin in two weeks the relief wells however will take months to execute cleanup efforts were hampered again sunday by bad weather and 7 to 10foot swells which prevented planes from dropping chemical dispersants and oil skimmers from corralling the slick on the surface mr fryar said that for a second day crews were injecting chemical dispersant into the oil as it flowed from the main leak dispersant which is more conventionally used on the water surface breaks the oil into small droplets and reduces its buoyancy so it will sink to the bottom mr fryar said technicians were trying to determine whether it would be possible to inject the dispersant directly into the riser deep under the water so that it would mix better with the flowing oil we think this dispersant is highly effective he said were hoping the oil wont make it to the surface the impact of chemical dispersants on deepwater ecology is unclear closer to land crews continued to put out booms to stop the oil and were training volunteers in mississippi and florida to help minimize the impact if the slick reaches the beach said john curry head of external affairs at bp speaking to reporters in the rain in venice la after talking with response teams that have amassed on the coast to try to stem the tide of oil lapping the shoreline mr obama vowed that the government would keep up the pressure on bp while he did not criticize the company in his public remarks mr obamas comments reflected increased frustration in the administration with bps inability to plug the oil leak the president again reiterated that american taxpayers would not foot the bill bp is responsible for this leak — bp will be paying the bill mr obama said mr obama had initially not planned to visit the region until later this week at the earliest white house officials said friday afternoon but by late friday night with criticism mounting that the governments response was too slow white house officials decided that the president needed to make the trip to the gulf on sunday white house officials sent two cabinet officials to appear on the sunday television talk shows with the message that the administration was doing everything it could to take control of the spill and that it had been involved from the beginning homeland security secretary janet napolitano said on fox news sunday that the government had an all hands on deck approach to the disaster for mr obama the widening environmental calamity in the gulf is made even more complicated politically by the fact that the spill occurred just a month after

We will clean it up,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nBP was leasing the Deepwater Horizon oil rig that exploded on April 20. Two days later, it collapsed into the gulf, and the oil began leaking. BP, working with an array of government agencies and private companies, has been unable to stop the flow of crude from the well.\n\nBob Fryar, the company’s senior vice president for operations in Angola, who was brought to a command center in Houston for the engineering effort, said that on Monday, BP hoped to install a shut-off valve on one of the three leaks. That may stop some of the oil flow, Mr. Fryar said.\n\nBut the biggest leak, at the end of the riser pipe, which Mr. Fryar said was the source of most of the spewing oil, cannot be shut off this way. The company intends to address that leak by lowering a containment dome over it and then pumping the oil to the surface. That effort is still at least six days away, Mr. Fryar said.

It is a steel-framed stack of valves, rams, housings, tanks and hydraulic tubing that is designed to seal the well quickly in the event of a burst of pressure. It did not work when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded.\n\nMr. Fryar and Charlie Holt, BP’s drilling operations manager for the gulf, described an audacious plan to confront the blowout preventer problem.

            "text": "Yesterday, Tom Zeller Jr. and John Broder wrote a piece of news analysis that ran on the front page of the New York Times, suggesting that many of the fears surrounding the gulf oil crisis were overblown. The article aggravated many in the conservation community, because it was hung up on questions of just how big of deal this would turn out to be in the history books, instead of analyzing actual damage that was being done. They spoke to a number of experts who were oddly optimistic in their outlook -- and now, it turns out that there's a reason that at least one of them was so sunny: his conservation group has strong ties to the oil industry. ProPublica has the story:\n\nWith crude oil pouring into the Gulf of Mexico every day, the conventional wisdom about last month's explosion and spill has been that this is an environmental disaster of unpredictable scale. The New York Times, in a story published today on Page One [2], challenged this conventional wisdom by citing several experts. One of those was from a nonprofit group called the Gulf of Mexico Foundation: \"The sky is not falling,\" said Quenton R. Dokken [3], a marine biologist and the executive director of the Gulf of Mexico Foundation, a conservation group in Corpus Christi, Tex. \"We've certainly stepped in a hole and we're going to have to work ourselves out of it, but it isn't the end of the Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nsite says the group represents a \"wide range of interests,\" including \"agriculture, business, fisheries, industry, tourism, and the environment.\" But as it turns out, industry appears to be the most represented of those interests. At least half of the 19 members of the group's board of directors [5] have direct ties to the offshore drilling industry. One of them is currently an executive at Transocean, the company that owns the Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded last month, causing millions of gallons of oil to spill into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThat seemed to be a pretty lax response to a veritable underground volcano of oil, pumping at the very least 210,000 gallons of oil into the Gulf a day -- so ProPublica decided to look into it. Anyone want to guess what they found out? Yes, that the Gulf of Mexico Foundation has extensive ties to the oil industry, and can therefore be reasonably said to have an interest in telling the New York Times that the spill isn't such a big deal. Here's what the non-profit journalist group found out: the Gulf of Mexico Foundation'sSeven of the GOM's other board members also work for oil companies, and oil companies routinely sponsor events held for the board of directors. Read the full account at ProPublica\n\nNow, ProPublica's reporting has lead another of other sources to pick up the story, and the Times to print a correction in today's paper -- good thing there are such watchdog groups out there. Otherwise, we'd have no idea that the narrative about what's shaping up to be the biggest oil disaster in decades be shaped by spokespeople from the oil industry. It's an important principle to keep in mind, too, as you sift through all the reports bubbling up -- who has an interest in saying what? I'll be looking more closely into who may be in BP's pocket, for instance, in future posts.\n\nMore on the Gulf Oil Spill\n\nGulf of Mexico Oil Spill : The What, When and Where\n\nBP Oil Spill : Videos to Catch Up",

restricting the flow to 5000 barrels or 210000 gallons per day if the wellhead is lost oil could leave the well at a much greater rate perhaps up to 150000 barrels or more than 6 million gallons per day based on government data showing daily production at another deepwater gulf well by comparison the exxon valdez spill was 11 million gallons total the gulf spill could end up dumping the equivalent of 4 exxon valdez spills per week typically a very good well in the gulf can produce 30000 barrels a day but thats under control i have no idea what an uncontrolled release could be said

19000 barrels a day according to an official with the us geological survey mongabay heard your mention of the oil disaster in the gulf of mexico this morning and you and most everyone else except maybe george noory are totally missing the boat on how big and bad a disaster this is first fact the original estimate was about 5000 gallons of oil a day spilling into the ocean now theyre saying 200000 gallons a day thats over a million gallons of crude oil a week im an engineer with 25 years experience ive worked on some big projects with big machines maybe thats why this mess is so clear to me first the bp platform was drilling for what they call deep oil they go out where the ocean is about 5000 feet deep and drill another 30000 feet into the crust of the earth this it right on the edge of what human technology can do well this time they hit a pocket of oil at such high pressure that it burst all of their safety valves all the way up to the drilling rig and then caused the rig to explode and sink take a moment to grasp the import of that the pressure behind this oil is so high that it destroyed the maximum effort of human science to contain it when the rig sank it flipped over and landed on top of the drill hole some 5000 feet under the ocean now theyve got a hole in the ocean floor 5000 feet down with a wrecked oil drilling rig sitting on top of it spewing maybe up to 200000 barrels of oil a day into the ocean take a moment and consider that will you first they have to get the oil rig off the hole to get at it in order to try to cap it do you know the level of effort it will take to move that wrecked oil rig sitting under 5000 feet of water that operation alone would take years and hundreds of millions to accomplish then how do you cap that hole in the muddy ocean floor there just is no way no way the only piece of human technology that might address this is a nuclear bomb im not kidding if they put a nuke down there in the right spot it might seal up the hole nothing short of that will work if we cant cap that hole that oil is going to destroy the oceans of the world it only takes one quart of motor oil to make 250000 gallons of ocean water toxic to wildlife are you starting to get the magnitude of this were so used to our politicians creating false crises to forward their criminal agendas that we arent recognizing that were staring

stadium in chicago fermi lab when did the spacecraft and humanoids land at edwards afb some time around 1964 that would have been 20 years after the manhattan project to develop the atomic bomb thats right the thing was that albert einstein had a theory that light was the source of all the laws of physics that it would tie in with the planets with the speed of sound speed of light tie in with everything and if so why shouldnt light tie in with human beings there would be somewhere that light had something to do with us humans depending upon the genes we had in our bodies thats why we had all those medical scientists up there working we were trying to find things in the human system that no one had ever found before we knew we are producing electricity in our bodies yes there is current running through humans einstein died in 1955 still trying to work that theory out but i have racks of papers that he and fermi myself and robert oppenheimer worked on edward teller was distant

The Gulf Of Mexico Oil Spill Continues To Spread � And Nobody Seems To Know How To Stop It In the three weeks since the April 20th 2010 explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, and the start of the subsequent massive (and ongoing) oil leak, many attempts have been made to contain and control the scale of the environmental disaster. Oil dispersants are being sprayed, containment booms erected, protective barriers built, controlled burns undertaken, and devices are being lowered to the sea floor to try and cap the leaks, with little success to date. While tracking the volume of the continued flow of oil is difficult, an estimated 5,000 barrels of oil (possibly much more) continues to pour into the gulf every day. While visible damage to shorelines has been minimal to date as the oil has spread slowly, the scene remains, in the words of President Obama, a \"potentially unprecedented environmental disaster.\" The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has grown to an estimated 3.5 million gallons. The massive concrete and steel dome that BP officials lowered over the leak to try to contain it did not work. BP's next plan involves throwing trash at the leak. Seriously. BP engineers are examining whether they can close the failed blowout preventer by stuffing it with trash.The foul stench of the oil spill has already drifted over some parts of southwestern Louisiana. \n\n \n\n This satellite photo made Thursday, April 29, 2010 and provided by NASA shows the oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico as it closes in on the Pass a Loutre area of Plaquemines Parish, La. As the oil from the massive spill in the Gulf of Mexico was starting to ooze ashore Friday, officials told the Press-Register that the worst-case scenario could arise should a wellhead at the Deepwater Horizon rig site fail. [ AP Photo/NASA ] The worst-case scenario for the broken and leaking well gushing oil into the Gulf of Mexico would be the loss of the wellhead currently restricting the flow to 5,000 barrels -- or 210,000 gallons per day. If the wellhead is lost, oil could leave the well at a much greater rate, perhaps up to 150,000 barrels -- or more than 6 million gallons per day -- based on government data showing daily production at another deepwater Gulf well. By comparison, the Exxon Valdez spill was 11 million gallons total. The Gulf spill could end up dumping the equivalent of 4 Exxon Valdez spills per week. \"Typically, a very good well in the Gulf can produce 30,000 barrels a day, but that's under control. I have no idea what an uncontrolled release could be,\" said Stephen Sears, chairman of the petroleum engineering department at Louisiana State University. \n\n Oil flows out of the top of the transition spool, which was placed into BP's gushing wellhead and will house the new containment cap, at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico earlly Monday.

MONGABAY \"Heard your mention of the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico this morning, and you (and most everyone else except maybe George Noory) are totally missing the boat on how big and bad a disaster this is. First fact, the original estimate was about 5,000 gallons of oil a day spilling into the ocean. Now they're saying 200,000 gallons a day. That's over a million gallons of crude oil a week! I'm an engineer with 25 years experience. I've worked on some big projects with big machines. Maybe that's why this mess is so clear to me. First, the BP platform was drilling for what they call deep oil. They go out where the ocean is about 5,000 feet deep and drill another 30,000 feet into the crust of the earth.

When the rig sank it flipped over and landed on top of the drill hole some 5,000 feet under the ocean. Now they've got a hole in the ocean floor, 5,000 feet down with a wrecked oil drilling rig sitting on top of it spewing [maybe] up to 200,000 (?) barrels of oil a day into the ocean. Take a moment and consider that, will you! First they have to get the oil rig off the hole to get at it in order to try to cap it. Do you know the level of effort it will take to move that wrecked oil rig, sitting under 5,000 feet of water? That operation alone would take years and hundreds of millions to accomplish.

[ Unable to source the author ]. Linda Moulton-Howe: \n\n Dolphins, sharks, crabs, stingrays, mullets and schools of fish are swimming unusually close to Gulf of Mexico shores, apparently because the outer waters are now so badly polluted by BP's gushing crude oil disaster that is causing life-giving oxygen levels in the Gulf to drop dangerously low. The BP oil contains 40% methane compared to typical crude oil that has 5% methane. Shoreline water is cleaner and has more oxygen. When oxygen levels decrease and marine organisms die, the natural breakdown of the oil also stops, compounding the environmental threat. Further, there is growing concern about new fissures and cracks visible in BP's live video feeds from the gushing hole a mile down. Experts say the pressure of the methane gas underneath BP's �Macondo� oil hole could be as high as 100,000 pounds per square inch (psi). There is no oil industry technology that can cap such ultra high pressure. What happens if the methane gas explodes uncontrollably? A Gulf tsunami could hit Gulf beaches. Update: Also on June 23, 2010, Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen reported that BP's containment cap was removed after a robotic vehicle bumped into a cap vent and closed it, which could cause a build up of hydrate crystals. Allen also said that two oil recovery workers in the Gulf of Mexico died, one swimming and the other operating a boat. Mongabay [ http://inspire.mongabay.com ] \n\n Methane and Climate Change: From the Amazon to the Gulf of Mexico \n\n (20/6/2010) In surveying the environmental damage unleashed from the BP oil spill, could we be missing the 800-pound gorilla in the closet? While oil poses undeniable ecological risks, methane (CH4) could prove daunting as well. As it turns out, crude which is destroying the Gulf of Mexico contains about 40 percent methane which may suffocate marine life and create vast �dead zones� where oxygen becomes so depleted that nothing is allowed to live. \n\n May 8, 1997, Interview with Edward Leverne Moragne, Ph.D.: \n\n Howe: �Well, that's true pretty much.

That crew burned and boiled at that craft for a week or ten days. \n\n L.M.H. - FOR A WEEK OR TEN DAYS, OUR MILITARY TRIED TO CUT INTO THE SPACECRAFT? \n\n E.L.M. - Yeah, they tried all different spots along the craft. \n\n WERE THERE ANY BURN MARKS OR CUTS? \n\n No. You couldn't even tell where they were trying to burn that craft! \n\n DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THAT CAUSED THE SPACECRAFT AND THE HUMANOIDS TO LAND AT EDWARDS AFB? \n\n No, I wasn't out there at that time. I was in Chicago - we were working in the stadium in Chicago (Fermi lab). \n\n WHEN DID THE SPACECRAFT AND HUMANOIDS LAND AT EDWARDS AFB? \n\n Some time around 1964. \n\n THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 20 YEARS AFTER THE MANHATTAN PROJECT TO DEVELOP THE ATOMIC BOMB? \n\n That's right.

I'm pretty sure it was 1964 when we got that call from Edwards AFB because I had just bought a new car and they had changed the models. It was a Thunderbird and the prettiest car I'd ever seen. It was a low car and I'd gotten a light blue color. I was driving from Chicago. By the way, it didn't start at Edwards AFB. It was up there in Nevada in the desert where the big disc landed, out in the boondocks. There were some sheep ranchers that called the U. S.

I've never seen levels like this in the ocean before.� - John Kessler, Ph.D., Chemical Oceanographer, Texas A & M Univ. Based on U. S. government estimates, today the British Petroleum (BP) oil disaster will break the record for most massive oil spill in Gulf of Mexico history when the methane-rich crude oil passes the140 million gallon mark. Until now, the Permex Ixtoc I oil blowout in the Gulf was the biggest, lasting from June 3, 1979, until March 23, 1980, spilling 3 million barrels (126 million gallons). The BP oil hole is spewing crude that is 40% natural gas/methane that can end up depleting oxygen and causing one or more dead zones where marine life cannot live. If this methane ignites, the actual atmosphere will go up in flames in the area In the work I am doing on the Hidden Texts of Nostredamus, he says for the decoder/s to work on the FIRE chapter next, and that next year will be the �heating year�.

            "text": "If you're looking for a top-tier matchup absolutely loaded with some of the best players in the country, you've obviously come to the right place, giving you plenty of reasons to snag a few tickets and get ready to see a big game you won't soon forget. On the gridiron, both programs have also had plenty of amazing players as well, helping to make each and every one of their gridiron battles something to behold, complete with two passionate fan bases that always show up in droves to provide the backbone of a big game. When it comes to hoops, these two teams also have developed a major rivalry, as both programs have histories filled with top-tier players, many of whom have gone on to stardom on the next level.\n\nAnd that's really only the tip of the iceberg, as Clemson-Wake Forest has a great rivalry that spans well beyond basketball and football. Grab your favorite team gear and get right into the middle of the action and you'll see what all the buzz is about, as it doesn't get any better than when Clemson and Wake Forest are in the middle of a great game that everyone around town is talking about. Though the pros are great to watch too, there's something extra special when it's just team pride on the line, and that's exactly what you're going to get whenever the Tigers take on the Demon Deacons of Wake Forest.\n\nMore than anything, the Demon Deacons of Wake Forest are a terror on the hardwood. The Wake Forest Demon Deacons have seen a lot of great players hit the court over the years, and those payers have been a big part of the enduring success that this program has boasted for a long time. With big-time alumni like NBA stars Chris Paul and Tim Duncan, you never know when the next premier player is going to walk through the doors at Wake Forest University, making it always the perfect time to get out and show your support as the Deacons look to give their fans another memorable season. For the Tigers, many of their top players even go on to play in the NBA as well, such as former Chicago Bulls forward Horace Grant and former Indiana Pacers forward Dale Davis.\n\nOn the gridiron, there have been plenty of amazing players as well, and neither university is lacking when it comes to prominent players around their various sports. As soon as you're there watching the game the way it was meant to be seen, you'll understand why these two programs have such an incredible history of success. When the buzz of the fans is rising in anticipation of an epic finale, you'll see the difference between the arena and watching from home with crystal clarity.\n\nOnce you've been in the stands for a big game between the Demon Deacons and the Tigers alongside your fellow fans, it will be hard to go back. No matter how many other sports there are, it doesn't get any better than top-tier college athletics, as there's something special about seeing the best amateur athletes in the world when it's only team pride on the line. With two close universities and excitable fan bases, these matchups tend to be just about as good as it gets for college sporting events, and that's not something likely to change anytime in the near future as they continue to battle for supremacy in the ACC.\n\nThese are two programs that go back a very long time, and over the years they've built a major rivalry that makes every one of their matchups highly anticipated around campus. With 19 different varsity teams, the Clemson Tigers have plenty of great athletes, which is where they have lots of common ground with the Demon Deacons, who have 16 different varsity programs and a trophy case just as impressive. Wake Forest happens to be the older of the two universities, dating back to 1834, but Clemson also has a very old and respected university as well, with its inaugural year happening all the way back in 1889.\n\nDid you know that Wake Forest once had John Heisman coaching the program?\n\nKnown for being the namesake of the Heisman Trophy, John Heisman was, well, one of the greatest college athletes/coaches of all-time, and he came through campus to guide the Tigers from 1900-1903 on the gridiron.\n\nIt doesn't get any better than when they're taking each other on during a football matchup, as these two universities both have talented programs on a regular basis, giving you plenty of reasons to head out and see the action for yourself. Don't forget about the hoops matchups, though, as both the men's and women's teams have strong programs and are never shy on electrifying playmakers. Both of these universities have proud athletic programs that seem to only get better from year to year, guaranteeing that Clemson-Wake Forest matchups remain as good as it gets for college athletics.",

            "text": "In the middle of potentially America’s worst environmental disaster, BP is attempting to squarely shift the blame for the Deepwater Horizon disaster from itself to Transocean.\n\nAs BP’s CEO Tony Hayward prepares to meet key Congressmen in Washington today, you can see part of BP‘s PR strategy in play with the simple message: We are not to blame, although we will clean up the mess.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC yesterday, Hayward said: “This was not our accident … This was not our drilling rig. This was not our equipment. It was not our people, our systems or our processes. This was Transocean’s rig. Their systems. Their people. Their equipment.”\n\nBut this was not the only crucial equipment that was missing:\n\nBP is also in denial about the success of BP’s response to the spill. “We have contained the oil in the offshore”, said Hayward, calling the response plan “a success”.\n\nHe went on to add that “There is today no oil on the shore, there is no oil forecast to be on the shore.”\n\nThis is in complete contrast to news stories that have oil already washed up on the shore and maps plotting the course of the main spill expecting it to hit land today.\n\nAnd even if the wind changes and much of the oil stays at sea, this is hardly good news.  Jacqueline Savitz, a senior scientist at Oceana, a nonprofit environmental group, argues “Some people are saying, it hasn’t gotten to shore yet so it’s all good.”\n\nShe continues: “But a lot of animals live in the ocean, and a spill like this becomes bad for marine life as soon as it hits the water. You have endangered sea turtles, the larvae of bluefin tuna, shrimp and crabs and oysters, grouper. A lot of these are already being affected and have been for 10 days. We’re waiting to see how bad it is at the shore, but we may never fully understand the full impacts on ocean life.”\n\nSo when Congressmen grill Hayward later today, they should grill him over BP’s record of trying to oppose enhanced safety features on the rigs.\n\nThey should grill him about putting profit over safety and the environment.\n\nBrent Coon, a lawyer who sued BP over a previous deadly oil facility explosion, is now representing a 24-year-old roustabout who was working on the rig at the time of the blast.\n\n“BP stands apart, heads and shoulders above all the rest of them, with respect to their conduct,” argues Coon. “It’s like they just don’t care.”\n\nSo Mr. Hayward it is your accident.\n\nAnd no matter what you think, the public rightly believes you are to blame.",

            "text": "A hard hat covered in oil that was found in Louisiana waters Monday. One Russian consultant suggested stopping the leak with a nuclear blast Tuesday.\n\nA growing environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico from a huge oil spill is raising red flags among Russian environmentalists, who warned on Tuesday that local oil companies must act to avoid a similar occurrence at home.\n\nUp to 5,000 barrels of oil have been leaking into gulf waters every day since an explosion sank a drilling rig on April 22. President Barack Obama has warned of a \"potentially unprecedented\" environmental disaster as the oil slick spreads toward the U.S. coastline.\n\nThe cleanup could cost BP an estimated $15 billion. The company, whose shares have plummeted by 15 percent since the blast, has blamed the rig's contractor, Transocean, for the accident. But as the oil field's operator, BP has to cover the cost of the cleanup under U.S. law.\n\nA neglect of safety measures at Russian oil fields has put the Arctic, the Perm region and the Komi republic at particular risk of oil spills, environmentalists said.\n\n“No companies are able to 100 percent prevent those kind of catastrophes,” said Vladimir Chuprov, a senior official with Greenpeace Russia\n\nSince Russia has a relatively small number of drilling platforms, aging pipelines pose the main risk, environmentalists said.\n\n“Oilmen are behaving badly, with a particularly bad attitude toward oil transportation,” said Alexei Yablokov, a leading Russian environmentalist and an adviser to the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nRussian oil pipelines spring 30,000 to 40,000 leaks every year, most of which go unknown to the public and media, he said.\n\nThe Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean pipeline, run by state pipeline operator Transneft, has sprung at least three oil leaks since January, according to Greenpeace Russia. One of the leaks, near the city of Lensk in the Sakha republic, spilled oil over 20,000 square meters.\n\nKomi, near the Finnish border, suffered the most serious environmental disaster in recent years when more than 100,000 tons of oil leaked through a rusty pipeline operated by the Komineft oil company in 1994, covering 70 hectares of land. Another large oil spill occurred in the same region in 2006, this time from a leaky pipeline operated by LUKoil.\n\nEven though 15 years have passed since the Komineft disaster, the local population is still suffering, said Chuprov of Greenpeace. “The oil is gone, but the pastures are still damaged and people still eat fish that smells of gasoline,” he said.\n\nA LUKoil spokesman said Tuesday that he could not comment on the issue of oil spills. Komineft and Transneft officials were unavailable for immediate comment.\n\nBut Transneft has agreed to create an environmental task force in Sakha in response to the recent leaks, Alexander Morozkin, deputy speaker of the republic's legislature, told reporters last week.\n\nThe Emergency Situations Ministry, which has a task force to combat environmental disasters, declined to provide comment on its readiness to fight an oil spill similar to the one in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe remote locations of Russia's oil drillers make it difficult — and prohibitively expensive — to draft a contingency plan to deal with a leak, said a senior official with a Russian consulting company that provides expertise on preventing oil spills.\n\n“It is expensive for them to spend money on the environment,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to damage his company's relations with its clients, which include several major oil firms.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian company Centurion Group, which operates a Japanese-made vessel designed to collect oil from the surface of the water, has offered help to U.S. authorities in the Gulf of Mexico, its head, Alexander Gorshenin, told RIA-Novosti on Tuesday.\n\nAlexander Moskalenko, head of GCE, a St. Petersburg-based group that advises oil companies, suggested that U.S. authorities conduct an underwater nuclear explosion to bury the leaking well.\n\nThe Gulf of Mexico is also seen by Russian oil companies as a promising place to drill. Last year, state-owned Zarubezhneft signed several agreements with Cuba's Cubapetroleo to search for oil fields there.",

Pictures of birds coated in the black substance have covered the front pages of newspapers and have been splashed across various news reports. What you haven’t heard so much about is what damage this disaster has had and could potentially continue to have for a long long time for the marine ecology.\n\nSome people are saying, “It hasn’t gotten to shore yet so it’s all good,”.But we’re forgetting about the thousands of species that live in the ocean and a spill like this is bad for marine life as soon as it hits the water. You have endangered sea turtles, the larvae of bluefin tuna, shrimp, crabs, oysters, grouper and dolphins to name a few creatures already affected by the slick. Dolphins bodies saturated in oil have washed up on shores. These creatures are so badly affected due to their necessity to surface twice a minute to breathe and all they inhale is the fumes from the spill. What can’t be assessed is the loss in the form of fish eggs, larvae and hatch-lings in their most sensitive stages of life that will be wiped out in such numbers that could move species into extinction or dangerously low numbers.\n\nThe undersea oil poses a direct threat to marine wildlife, such as fish, sharks and cetaceans and also to the tiny stuff, including zooplankton, shrimp, corals, crabs and worms. By endangering these latter populations, the foundation of the marine food chain, the oil could have chronic long-term effects on the wider Gulf ecosystem.\n\nAnother worry is that the oil could soon extend its reach, traveling around the tip of Florida and entering Atlantic waters. The oil which entered the Gulf of Mexico’s fast-moving Loop Current, a powerful conveyor belt that carries the warm Gulf water through the Straits of Florida. Eventually, the Gulf Stream becomes the North Atlantic Current, destined for Western Europe where its fan-like tendrils become the Norwegian Current. The moment this oil makes it to the Atlantic, it becomes global! But for right now, the 5,000-7,000 year old shallow coral reefs along the Florida coast especially the Keys with its 500 odd species of fish and marine life including spiny lobsters, snow crabs, Caribbean manatees, American crocodiles, leatherback, loggerhead, Kemp’s ridley and green sea turtles are in eminent danger of the spreading oil. This reef being the 3rd largest coral reef formation on Earth, could potentially spell major marine ecological disaster!\n\nSo even if the spilling oil can finally be capped, mitigating the damage…the damage is already done! If there can be any silver lining to this catastrophe, it may be that it is the wake-up call we’ve needed to start moving more rapidly away from fossil fuels to a clean, renewable energy future and opt for clean and green energy sources whenever possible.",

prove its point with anonymous sources and experts with ties to the oil industry itself under the headline bad but an apocalypse reporters john m broder and tom zeller jr attempt to put recent events in historical perspective reminding us of the damage wreaked by such memorable spills as the exxon valdez in 1989 or the ixtoc 1 in 1979 which dumped 140 million gallons of crude oil after quoting president obamas assertion that the spill is potentially unprecedented the reporters counter with several unprovable assertions designed to suggest that the presidents concerns may be misplaced a view presumably shared by the corporate interests charged with cleaning up the horrific mess they made yet the deepwater horizon blowout is not unprecedented the reporters assert without explanation or attribution nor is it yet among the worst oil accidents in history how does the nyt know this an expert told them which expert oh you knowan unnamed expert and to add to the problem its an unnamed expert who speaks in meaningless metaphors and is allowed to do so in the storys fifth paragraph right there on the front page of the nyt as one expert put it broder and zeller write this is the first inning of a nineinning game no one knows the final score yikes lets just hope our team wins and the game doesnt go into extra innings to be sure broder and zeller take note of those who worry that this latest spill may hurt the regions land areas and wildlife no one the reporters declare not even the oil industrys most fervent apologists is making light of this accident what a relief to know that bp executives havent started regaling themselves with oil slick jokes but the news analysis moves quickly to quote experts who suggest that favorable wind conditions mean the worst could be avoided the nyt turns next for a quote to edward b overton professor emeritus of environmental science at louisiana state who compares this spill favorably with the exxon valdez right now what people are fearing has not materialize people have the idea of an exxon valdez with a gunky smelly black tide looming over the horizon waiting to wash ashore i do not anticipate this will happen down here unless things get a lot worse but overton has been quoted elsewhere in the media making the opposite statement arguing that this spill has been among the most devastating in history specifically overton has warned that based on early analysis the spill could include a heavy crude oil potentially devestating to the environment of the region from the los angeles times on may 1 just three days ago the analysis is based on only a single sample but it has caused my level of apprehension to go way up said environmental scientist edward b overton of louisiana state university who is analyzing the oil for the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration so far he appears to be the only researcher who thinks there may be a biggerthanexpected problem with the oil were hoping and praying that it is louisiana sweet crude overton added but if it is notthis is going to be a very unique spill we have never seen a spill with this high an asphaltenic content why is the nyt now quoting overton making the opposite point the nyt story goes on to says that while the potential for catastrophe remained there were reasons to remain guardedly optimistic to support that point the reporters deliver the ultimate cliche quote and from an expert with direct though undisclosed ties to the oil industry itself the sky isnt falling quenton r dokken executive director of the gulf of mexico foundation told the nyt weve certainly stepped in a hole and were going to have to work ourselves out of it but it isnt the end of the gulf of mexico the gulf of mexico foundation in case you were wondering is a nonprofit organization supported largely by grants from the oil companies themselves most of the members of its board of directors are executives at the oil companies currently on the foundations board of directors dr ian hudson head of corporate responsibility at transocean the offshore drilling contractor that owned the deepwater horizon thats the rig that exploded last month leading to the spill of course this doesnt officially taint dokkens quotes but as an executive whose fortunes are tied to partnerships between his group and the oil and gas companies that fund it including bp conocophillips marathon etc hes hardly an objective observer of corporate malfeasance it isnt until well into the second half of the news anaylysis that zeller and broder get around to interviewing those who think the sky may in fact be falling after all some people are saying it hasnt gotten to shore yet so its all good said jacueline savitz a senior scientist at oceana a respected nonprofit environmental group with no ties to industry but a lot of animals live in the ocean and a spill like this becomes bad for marine life as soon as it hits the water you have endangered sea turtles the larvae of bluefin tuna shrimp and crabs and oysters grouper a lot of these are already being affected and have been for 10 days were waiting to see how bad it is at the shore but we may never fully understand the full impacts on ocean life sounds pretty horrible to us why would the nyt feel compelled to present an essentially proindustry story on its front page so soon after the spill and the public outcry over its effects its hard to know but its easy to see that whatever its intentions the story failed on its most basic task of providing informative objective and ontherecord quotes to readers and letting them make the best possible judgement based on the facts update a nyt editors note wednesday morning acknowledges that yesterdays pageone news analysis of the gulf oil spill should have made clear that one of the sources it quoted who told the nyt the sky isnt falling with regard to the spill works for an organization with strong ties to the oil industry those industry connections were first reported yesterday morning by the nytpicker the story by reporters john m broder and tom zeller jr quoted quenton r dokken executive director of the gulf of mexico foundation as an objective expert on the crisis in the gulf but as the nytpicker noted yesterday the foundation includes several industry leaders on its board including an official at transocean the offshore drilling contractor that owned the deepwater horizon the rig that exploded last month leading to the spill heres the full text of the editors note a frontpage news analysis article on tuesday discussed the uncertainty over the ultimate environmental impact of the oil spill in the gulf of mexico one expert quoted was quenton r dokken a marine biologist who is the executive director of the gulf of mexico foundation he said the spill isnt the end of the gulf of mexico but also said that weve always got to ask ourselves how long can we keep heaping these insults on the gulf and having it bounce back the article described the gulf of mexico foundation simply as a conservation group it should have included more information about the organization a nonprofit group that says its mission is to promote and facilitate conservation of the health and productivity of the gulf of mexico and its resources through research and other programs while the group says the majority of its funding comes from federal and state grants it also receives some money from the oil industry and other business interests in the gulf and includes industry executives on its

danger that this oil spill represents if it continues to spread hundreds of species of animals and plants are at risk millions of living things in the gulf of mexico are going to die the entire region

really really really bad just consider the following quote from richard charter of the defenders of wildlife it is so big and expanding so fast that its pretty much beyond human response that can be effective youre looking at a longterm poisoning of the area ultimately this will have a multidecade impact so just how much oil is flowing into the gulf of mexico at this point well bp spokeswoman ayana mcintoshlee said on monday that the damaged well is releasing 210000 gallons of oil a day into the gulf of mexico barack obama is calling this oil spill a potentially unprecedented environmental disaster in fact federal officials have already closed a portion of the northern gulf of mexico to all fishing it would be hard to underestimate how serious this is for folks who live along the gulf coast residents of the gulf region are starting to fear that the damage from this oil spill will be worse than the damage caused by hurricane katrina one louisiana resident recently put it this way a hurricane is like closing your bank account for a few days but this here has the capacity to destroy our bank accounts but there are signs that this disaster is going to get even worse before it starts to get better it is being reported that a confidential government report on the disaster in the gulf makes it clear that the coast guard now fears the damaged well could become an unchecked gusher shooting millions of gallons of oil per day into the gulf one alabama newspaper has posted excerpts from this alarming report the following is not public reads the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations emergency response document dated april 28th that was posted on two additional release points were found today in the tangled riser if the riser pipe deteriorates further the flow could become unchecked resulting in a release volume an order of magnitude higher than previously thought if that report is even partially true then we may not have even seen the worst of things yet even if things remain as they are it is already being projected that this could be the most costly environmental disaster in history estimates vary at this point but it is being reported that some analysts are already projecting that the costs related to the oil spill could exceed 14 billion dollars the cost to the fishing industry in louisiana alone could top 3 billion dollars and it is being projected that the tourism industry in florida could lose even more than that but the truth is that it is way too early for estimates because as long as the damaged well keeps gushing oil the nightmare is only going to get worse so how long until things get better well us representative charlie melancon of louisiana has made a couple of statements about this disaster which are extremely chilling the bestcase scenario is that this lasts for a couple of weeks the worst case is that weve got several months to go in fact the obama administration and bp are both now indicating that the worst case scenario is more likely officials said on monday that it might take up to three months to completely seal off the leaking oil well that is not good news bp is certainly freaked out about all of this and they are already trying to claim that it was not their accident that caused all of this tony hayward the ceo of british petroleum told nbcs meredith vieira on monday that his company was not responsible for creating the oil spill in the gulf of mexico but that they are responsible for cleaning it up it wasnt our accident but we are absolutely responsible for the oil for cleaning it up and thats what we intend to do that sad thing is that this is the type of world we live in a world where the lawyers are in charge and nobody takes responsibility for anything for once it would be really nice to see a ceo stand up and admit responsibility for something but that just isnt going to happen meanwhile the more we learn about this oil spill the more frightening it becomes the reality is that we simply do not know at this point just yet how incredibly destructive this disaster may become in his recent article the oil mess the takedown of world economy george ure posted a message from one of his readers this is extremely troubling the reader is a very experienced engineer and his diagnosis of the danger that we are facing from this oil spill is incredibly frightening if what he says is true then we are headed for a complete and total nightmare a reader who is an engineer of considerable experience says watch this one evolve carefully because it is destined to continue to grow and he shares this long but worthy explanation why heard your mention of the oil disaster in the gulf of mexico this morning and you and most everyone else except maybe george noory are totally missing the boat on how big and bad of a disaster this is first fact the original estimate was about 5000 gallons of oil a day spilling into the ocean now theyre saying 200000 gallons a day thats over a million gallons of crude oil a week im engineer with 25 years of experience ive worked on some big projects with big machines maybe thats why this mess is so clear to me and is so unclear to the millions without such knowledge first the bp platform was drilling for what they call deep oil they go out where the ocean is about 5000 feet deep and drill another 30000 feet into the crust of the earth this it right on the edge of what human technology can do well this time they hit a pocket of oil at such high pressure that it burst all of their safety valves all the way up to the drilling rig and then caused the rig to explode and sink take a moment to grasp the import of that the pressure behind this oil is so high that it destroyed the maximum effort of human science to contain it when the rig sank it flipped over and landed on top of the drill hole some 5000 feet under the ocean now theyve got a hole in the ocean floor 5000 feet down with a wrecked oil drilling rig sitting on top of is spewing 200000 barrels of oil a day into the ocean take a moment and consider that will you first they have to get the oil rig off the hole to get at it in order to try to cap it do you know the level of effort it will take to move that wrecked oil rig sitting under 5000 feet of water that operation alone would take years and hundreds of millions to accomplish then how do you cap that hole in the muddy ocean floor there just is no way no way the only piece of human technology that might address this is a nuclear bomb im not kidding if they put a nuke down there in the right spot it might seal up the hole nothing short of that will work if we cant cap that hole that oil is going to destroy the oceans of the world it only takes one quart of motor oil to make 250000 gallons of ocean water toxic to wildlife are you starting to get the magnitude of this were so used to our politicians creating false crises to forward their criminal agendas that we arent recognizing that were staring straight into possibly the greatest disaster mankind will ever see imagine what happens if that oil keeps flowing until it destroys all life in the oceans of this planet who knows how big of a reservoir of oil is down there not to mention that the oceans are critical to maintaining the proper oxygen level in the atmosphere for human life were humped unless god steps in and

            "text": "If hip-hop is party music, then Ceschi Ramos’s third solo outing, The One Man Band Broke Up, is music for the saddest party in recorded human history. Although my fiancée insists I possess the most depressing record collection in the world, I honestly cannot remember the last time I encountered an album as gruelingly and relentlessly bleak as this. Revolving around the suicide of a musician and titular one-man band named Julius, the record forgoes any kind of linear narrative. Instead, Ramos pours most of his energy into isolating the emotional realities that pushed the protagonist toward his end — loneliness, frustration, and ultimately disillusionment with not only the music industry but the act of creation itself — and he hammers these with an unremitting intensity.\n\nRamos is like a Krav Maga master with a mic; every utterance seems calculated to inflict maximum damage. Some of the songs contain nested allusions that only reveal themselves upon multiple listens. In one of the most prominent lyrics in the title track, Ramos proclaims, “The moral of the story is/ No one really gives a shit/ Don’t cry for the swatted flies/ They loved what they did.” A grim enough sentiment in its own right, but it takes on a whole new level of ugliness and misanthropy when you realize that, just a second ago, he said of the protagonist, ”Loving what you did/ Only got you/ So far through these years.” And that’s really only the tip of the iceberg. Take a look at a few more of the more inspirational passages:\n\n”All these animals/ With their paws in traps/ All the animals/ In this bar make me laugh/ It’s the way that their faces sink at half-mast/ It’s the way that our bodies stink” ”When all our flesh disintegrates/ We’ll perform for the worms” ”But he was only 45 when he died/ With no family left behind/ Just instruments and a mic/ And the story goes/ That he cried like a baby/ As he tied the noose waiting/ For someone to come and save him”\n\nBut while Ramos may be this year’s top contender for the “Artist Most in Need of a Hug” award, on a purely cursory listen, One Man Band comes off affably enough. The beats (provided by producer and labelmate DJ Scientist with some contributions from Ramos himself) are pure hipster-hop: plenty of strings, horns, and guitar, but with enough of a bass-drum to help the emcees keep time. Ramos’ machine-gun delivery is impressive, even invigorating at times, although his voice betrays an unfortunate and unmistakable similarity to former House of Pain front man Everlast. In true hipster-hop fashion, the album occasionally digresses into baroque rock territory. These forays, like “Lament for Captain Julius” and “For My Disappointing Hip Hop Heroes,” are a let-down. They often approach a solid hook or an interesting melody but either stop short or abruptly change direction before becoming fully realized.\n\nThe stylistic mish-mash detracts from the overall effect of the album, but the laser focus of the concept still holds it together as a coherent work, at times almost to a fault. I’ve listened to this front-to-back searching for some kernel of hope, some meager validation of the protagonist’s existence, but there’s just nothing there. The closest Julius ever comes to any kind of real human connection is in the song “No New York,” when an unnamed acquaintance repeats, “I tried to tell you backstage/ But the women got in the way/ And the drugs had already hit your brain.” What the speaker wanted to say — whether it was a warning or even some small token of affection or affirmation — is lost, forever unspoken.\n\nI don’t know what the overall takeaway is supposed to be when the album’s worldview is clearly so hopeless and mercilessly bitter, but Ramos deserves credit for his unflinching depictions of humanity at absolute rock bottom. The One Man Band Broke Up isn’t an easy listen, nor a uniformly enjoyable one, but if you’ve got the stomach for it, it will take you places that few other artists dare to tread.",

            "text": "Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. US President Barack Obama has described a sprawling oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico as a \"potentially unprecedented\" environmental disaster. Speaking in Louisiana, Mr Obama said his government would do whatever it takes to clean up the oil, adding that BP was responsible and must pay. He said the focus was now on preventing any further damage to the Gulf coast. BP says it will be at least a week before temporary measures to stem the leak are in place. But it could take up to three months to drill relief wells that could fully contain the spillage, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar warned on Sunday. BP is responsible for this leak, BP will be paying the bill \n\n Your stories of the oil spill The Deepwater Horizon rig, which was carrying out work on behalf of BP, sank on 22 April, two days after a huge explosion that killed 11 workers. Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal has warned the spill threatens the way of life in his state. Mr Obama flew to Louisiana on Sunday to see for himself the damage. Speaking in the town of Venice, he said: \"We're dealing with a massive and potentially unprecedented environmental disaster. \"The oil that is still leaking from the well could seriously damage the economy and the environment of our Gulf states. \"And it could extend for a long time. It could jeopardise the livelihoods of thousands of Americans who call this place home.\" The president said the slick was now nine miles (14km) off the coast of south-eastern Louisiana. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. And he warned: \"BP is responsible for this leak. BP will be paying the bill.\" BP chief executive Tony Hayward, who is in Louisiana to oversee the company's clean-up, said: \"I agree with the president that the top priority right now is to stop the leak and mitigate the damage.\" The company has said it will honour legitimate claims for damages. BP chairman Lamar McKay said they hoped to lower a hastily made dome a mile below the surface to cap the wellhead in the next six to eight days, as a short-term option. There have been warnings that within weeks the spill, if unchecked, could eclipse the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster as the worst in US history. The Louisiana wetlands host a multi-billion-dollar fishing industry and are a prime spawning area for fish, shrimp, crabs and oysters. Mississippi, Alabama and Florida have also declared a state of emergency and are considering their legal options.",

            "text": "On February 10, 2014, the Superior Court of California found sufficient cause to allow the California Department of Toxic Substance Control to take action against Clearwater Environmental Management for a variety of violations. Those actions have also resulted in the arrests of two key company officials on February 11th.\n\nIt’s yet another cautionary tale to “know your waste hauler” and this one proves that not only smaller hazardous waste generators can get duped; Clearwater’s clients included BART and several well-known environmental consulting companies. In a saga befitting of Erin Brockovich, the DTSC complaint demonstrates that Clearwater knowingly colluded with others to produce falsified manifests even after losing its license to transport hazardous waste in 2007.\n\nUsing the name of at least one other “waste broker” UNI Waste, Clearwater CEO Kirk Hayward and VP of Operations Charles Seaton essentially “hid in plain sight” (according to the complaint), by using the identity and license of UNI, going so far as to disguise their transport as UNI trucks. And that’s really only the tip of the iceberg with Clearwater. The company is also charged with Grand Theft on behalf of the many clients who paid them to legally dispose of their hazardous waste. As the complaint states, Clearwater…”systematically undermined their customer’s attempts to comply with the law, and cheated their customers out of significant sums of money.”\n\nOf equally deep concern is the fact that regulators have been unable to determine where Hayward and Seaton sent most of the missing waste. The paper trail shows it being shipped to a small oil recycling facility in Nevada – claims that are not substantiated.\n\nMostly it’s just hard to believe that companies continued to hire Clearwater, especially after the company lost its license to transport hazardous waste in 2007 and Hayward was sentenced to 60 days in jail and a $70,000 fine at that time. And the fact is, there is new leadership at the DTSC and they are committed to stopping these types of violations, and they are going to be making examples of the perpetrators. The moral to the story: don’t hesitate to ask for proof of compliance and government certifications from your waste management company. Routine questions to ask your waste management service provider are:\n\n1. Current and valid transporter registrations with the DTSC\n\n 2. Current ACORD statement showing levels of insurance and policy numbers\n\n 3. Motor Carrier permit issued by the DMV\n\n 4. Hazardous Materials Transportation License issued by the CHP\n\n 5. Hazardous Materials Certificate of Registration issued by the US DOT.",

            "text": "A MARINE scientist who led the oil clean-up operation after 1996’s Sea Empress disaster has spoken of the massive and prolonged environmental threat facing the US Gulf Coast.\n\nA MARINE scientist who led the oil clean-up operation after 1996’s Sea Empress disaster has spoken of the massive and prolonged environmental threat facing the US Gulf Coast.\n\nDrawing on his experience tackling 1996’s 72,000-tonne oil-spill off West Wales, Blaise Bullimore last night feared the damage now threatening parts of America’s coastline following last month’s oil rig blast would, by comparison, be far harder to undo.\n\nThe 57-year-old scientist, who lives near Haverfordwest, said much of the oil in the US will end up on soft salt marsh leaving disaster workers with a near impossible task of removing it.\n\nHe said attempting to use machinery to remove it from boggy salt marsh can cause more damage than the oil itself. When the Sea Empress hit rocks on her way to Milford Haven much of the ship’s oil was spilled onto shoreline, he said, offering easier access than US disaster workers now have.\n\nMeanwhile President Barack Obama has vowed that British energy giant BP will pay for the “massive” damage caused after their oil well exploded. The US leader flew to Louisiana on Sunday to inspect efforts to combat the effects of what he described as a “potentially unprecedented environmental disaster”.\n\nMr Bullimore said: “They’re really going to be very badly hit with the amount of marsh and enclosed waterways they’ve got there. Marshlands are the sort of places that oil persists for a very long time.\n\n“Most of the shore that the oil from the Sea Empress came ashore on was open coast and rock and the activity of the sea helped naturally to clean it.\n\n“On the Mississippi and Louisiana coast they’ve just got miles and miles of marshland and coastal flooded woodland and once it gets in there they won’t be able to clean it out without destroying the place.”\n\nLayers of oil spilled after ships’ tankers were bombed during World War II can still be found under salt marshes at Milford Haven so difficult is it to remove, said Mr Bullimore.\n\nThe scientist said this is the “probable scenario” facing the Gulf Coast.\n\nHe said most of Pembrokeshire’s wildlife had overcome the damage caused by the slick within five to 10 years of the 1996 disaster, though some algae and fungus living on the shore are still recovering.\n\nBecause of the scale of the disaster, native wildlife on the Gulf Coast may take longer to return to pre-slick levels, said Mr Bullimore.\n\nThe Gulf Coast blast on April 20 in the mile-deep well claimed the lives of 11 workers. Its full environmental consequences, however, remain to be seen amid fears for the habitats of hundreds of species of wildlife.\n\nAn estimated 1.6 million gallons of oil are estimated to have spilled since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank, creating a slick more than 130 miles long and 70 miles wide.\n\nFollowing the Exxon Valdez tanker disaster in 1989, 10.8 million gallons of oil leaked into the sea off the Alaska coast. Some marine species never recovered.\n\nMr Bullimore added: “From what I’ve seen of the maps it [the Gulf Coast spill] could well be very extensive and you could well be knocking out an awful lot of reproductive reservoir.\n\n“It could take a long time for some of that to recover.”\n\nAfter the Sea Empress disaster 120 miles of Welsh coastline were contaminated and the total cost of the clean-up operation was put at £60m.\n\nExperts warn that the cost of clearing up the Gulf Coast spill could run into billions of dollars.\n\nBP chairman Lamar McKay was unable to say when the well that continues to spew oil into the sea might be plugged. But he said a 74-tonne metal and concrete box could be placed over the well in six to eight days.\n\nHe added that BP officials were working to reactivate a “blow-out preventer” meant to seal off the geyser.\n\nIn a 2009 environmental impact analysis for the well, BP said an accident leading to a giant crude oil spill was unlikely or virtually impossible.\n\nBP chief executive Tony Hayward has said they will “absolutely be paying for the clean-up operation”.",

Any oil that does wash up is likely to be in the form of tarballs which are a \"little easier to manage\", Rear Adm Peter Neffenger said in testimony. Reports from the White House say a presidential commission will be set up to investigate the disaster. And a top official who oversaw offshore drilling has announced he is retiring. Chris Oynes said he would step down at the end of this month. There was no official comment on the reasons for the resignation of Mr Oynes from the Minerals Management Service (MMS). Senior officials there have been accused of becoming too close to the industry. Oil has been spewing into the Gulf since BP's Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on 20 April. US President Barack Obama has described it as a \"potentially unprecedented\" environmental disaster. An unnamed Obama administration official told the Associated Press news agency that President Barack Obama would establish a commission by executive order. Tarballs of oil are said to be more manageable It would, the official said, be similar to panels created to investigate the space shuttle Challenger disaster and the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island. It would study oil industry practices, rig safety, regulation and governmental oversight, as well as the \"structure and functions\" of the MMS, an official told Reuters news agency. At the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Rear Adm Peter Neffenger said that the government was closely watching whether the oil would be swept up into the \"loop current\" that moves around Florida. \"Currently it shows to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 40-50 miles [65km-80km] from the southern edge of the spill,\" he said. \"We are watching that carefully and as a result of that we are preparing for potential impact on the southern Florida coast and impacts around the southern Florida coast.\" I think we ought to be cautious in terms of defining what plumes are out there and how they're behaving \n\n Tarballs would, he suggested, be \"a more manageable piece\" than the slick in the Gulf of Mexico.
