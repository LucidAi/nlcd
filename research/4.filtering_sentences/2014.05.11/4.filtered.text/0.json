    "text": "UNITED NATIONS — Chemical weapons were used repeatedly in the Syria conflict this year, not only in a well-documented Aug. 21 attack near Damascus but also in four other instances, including two subsequent attacks that targeted soldiers, the United Nations said in a report released Thursday.\n\nThe report, prepared by chemical weapons specialists and doctors who traveled to Syria to conduct interviews and collect samples amid fighting, is the most comprehensive independent assessment of facts and allegations surrounding the use of chemical weapons in the conflict.\n\nIt was the first time the United Nations asserted as fact that chemical weapons had been used on multiple occasions in the fighting between the forces of President Bashar al-Assad and the insurgents seeking to topple him, including chemical weapons use after world outrage over the Aug. 21 attack, which killed hundreds of civilians, including children.\n\nA preliminary version of the report, which was released on Sept. 16 and focused only on the Aug. 21 attack near Damascus, played a role in developments that ultimately led to an agreement in which the Syrian government pledged to destroy all of its chemical munitions.\n\nThe destruction, which the United Nations is helping to oversee, has been proceeding for two months and is considered a conspicuous success in what is an increasingly grim conflict that has claimed more than 100,000 lives.\n\n“The United Nations Mission concludes that chemical weapons have been used in the ongoing conflict between the parties in the Syrian Arab Republic,” the final United Nations report stated.\n\nSecretary General Ban Ki-moon received the final version on Thursday and made it public about half an hour later.\n\nThe authors, members of a panel led by the Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom, studiously avoided saying who was responsible in any of the attacks, saying it was their mandate only to ascertain whether they had taken place.\n\nIn the preliminary report on the Aug. 21 attack, findings implicated Mr. Assad’s military by documenting the shape of the munitions and the precise direction from which two had been fired. But in the other attacks investigated by the panel in the final report, it is much less clear who was responsible.\n\nIn some, the panel said it could not establish a link between the actual attack and the victims, either because the investigators could not travel to the site or because they could not directly collect chemical or medical samples.\n\nThe report said the panel had corroborated “credible allegations” that chemical weapons were used in the first reported attack — a March 19 episode involving soldiers and civilians in Khan al-Assal in the country’s north. The investigators could not travel there, though, so verification was impossible.\n\nUnited Nations officials had been locked in an argument with the Syrian government for months over access to that site. It became inaccessible later because of heavy fighting. The United Nations disarmament chief, Angela Kane, said in an interview this fall that the failure to investigate that first chemical attack had haunted her.\n\nEach side in the conflict accused the other in that attack. The Syrian government pressed the United Nations to investigate that site alone, but the United Nations insisted on investigating other sites as well, which Syria refused. In the following months, the Khan al-Assal area was seized by insurgents linked to Al Qaeda, rendering travel there by the weapons inspectors too risky.\n\nAnd so, the panel of experts said, they interviewed medical and military personnel involved in the rescue operations at Khan al-Assal. The report said, “None of the parties in the Syrian Arab Republic denied the use of chemical weapons” in Khan al-Assal.\n\nSyria also insisted that chemical weapons had been used against its soldiers after the Aug. 21 attack. The report said there was evidence supporting “the probable use of chemical weapons” in two episodes in the Damascus area — in Jobar on Aug. 24 and Ashrafiah Sahnaya on Aug. 25. In both cases, the report said, chemical weapons may have been used on “a relatively small scale against soldiers.”\n\nThe report also concluded that chemical weapons had been used in the northwest town of Saraqeb on April 29, based on evidence that included interviews with medical clinicians, medical records and organ samples of a deceased victim.",
