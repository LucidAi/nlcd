            "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today is the first day of National Charter Schools Week. In celebration of the week, President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 4 – 10, 2014 National Charter Schools Week. President Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan are both strong supporters of public charter schools and regularly promote the innovation and opportunity charter schools bring to our schools and students.\n\nDuring National Charter Schools Week, we pay tribute to the role our Nation’s public charter schools play in advancing opportunity, and we salute the parents, educators, community leaders, policymakers, and philanthropists who gave rise to the charter school sector. As independent public schools, charter schools have the ability to try innovative approaches to teaching and learning in the classroom. This flexibility comes with high standards and accountability; charter schools must demonstrate that all their students are progressing toward academic excellence. Those that do not measure up can be shut down. And those that are successful can provide effective approaches for the broader public education system. They can show what is possible — schools that give every student the chance to prepare for college and career and to develop a love of learning that lasts a lifetime…\n\nI commend our Nation’s charter schools, teachers, and administrators, and I call on States and communities to support high quality public schools, including charter schools and the students they serve.\n\nClick here to read the full presidential proclamation.\n\nSince 2010, all but one independent research study has found that students in charter schools do better in school than their traditional school peers. For example, one study by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford University found that charter schools do a better job teaching low income students, minority students, and students who are still learning English than traditional schools. Separate studies by the Center for Reinventing Public Education and Mathematica Policy Research have found that charter school students are more likely to graduate from high school, go on to college, stay in college and have higher earnings in early adulthood.\n\nFor more information about National Charter Schools Week, please visit publiccharters.org/charterschoolsweek.\n\nAbout the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools\n\nThe National Alliance for Public Charter Schools is the leading national nonprofit organization committed to advancing the public charter school movement. Our mission is to lead public education to unprecedented levels of academic achievement by fostering a strong charter sector.

practices even so charter schools were not included in the initial group education experts said it might prove difficult to encourage the kind of sharing of ideas that charter schools were originally supposed to foster given competitive dynamics charter schools serve about 5 percent of publicschool students nationwide according to the national alliance for public charter schools up from about 1

Our Nation can only realize this idea through the guarantee of a world-class education for every child. During National Charter Schools Week, we pay tribute to the role our Nation's public charter schools play in advancing opportunity, and we salute the parents, educators, community leaders, policymakers, and philanthropists who gave rise to the charter school sector.\n\nAs independent public schools, charter schools have the ability to try innovative approaches to teaching and learning in the classroom. This flexibility comes with high standards and accountability; charter schools must demonstrate that all their students are progressing toward academic excellence. Those that do not measure up can be shut down. And those that are successful can provide effective approaches for the broader public education system. They can show what is possible -- schools that give every student the chance to prepare for college and career and to develop a love of learning that lasts a lifetime.\n\nAmericans pursue individual success, but we also understand that we have a stake in each other. If we make an investment in every child, then all our children will enjoy a stronger Nation and a brighter world. This week, let us do our part to ensure our young people can go as far as their passions and hard work will take them, and recommit to restoring the American dream for generations to come.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 4 through May 10, 2014, as National Charter Schools Week. I commend our Nation's charter schools, teachers, and administrators, and I call on States and communities to support high quality public schools, including charter schools and the students they serve.

what urban planners call it when you ride a bike to a transit stop load it onto the bus or light rail or whatever then unload it at your destination stop and finish the last leg to your office its great so far the building manager overruled the security guard who told me i had to leave the bike chained to a parking meter outside so i take it up to the office at lunchtime im no longer confined to the subway and rub pub on either side of our building or even the places farther away — i can ride to the eastern market and get a slice of supinos pizza or a sandwich from the russell street deli which has subway beat by a unit so large it no longer makes sense to measure it in miles last friday i was cruisin into work on the bus looking forward to the weekend when an alarm started beeping in the engine compartment the driver got on the horn with hq then pulled over and told us wed be waiting for another bus or a repair whichever came first this was the point when i realized just how important lastmile commuting is i took the bike down from the rack and announced it was time for plan b i rode off jefferson and into a terrible neighborhood one burnedandblighted house after another and then as though into emerald city i was in indian village a stately neighborhood of older homes a few blocks of this and back into the dodgy districts five men walked toward me spread across the road and i wondered if it was wise to stay on course decided to smile and wave and they smiled and waved back just a pod of local rummies getting their morning drink on it looked like then huzzah a bike lane and a cemetery final resting place of sonic smith some deteriorated light industrial a new high school this that a casino downtown and my office five miles roughly i should do this more often a perfect morning for a little bike ride then today i had to appear on a local radio show to discuss this story i walked into the lobby and who should be there but sixto rodriguez the searching for sugarman guy hed just stopped by to make a cash donation i really like your show craig he said i guess he didnt want to wait for another pledge campaign a guy i know who used to work at the station says he does it all the time — just swings by from time to time to drop a fifty into the tip jar now thats what i call publicradio support rodriguez gives away a lot of his money his daughter quotes him as saying once you have the foodclothingshelter part handled all the rest is icing he shares the icing so now im watching a few days of 80degree weather blow out with a thunderstorm with a 25degree drop ahead for the next few days we put the boat in friday balls some good bloggage today lets start with a category called fiery oratory emily bazelon reviews glenn greenwalds new book in slate a million jokesters have invited the nsa to listen in on their calls about feeding the cat or picking up the kids noting that most americans arent doing anything exciting enough to interest the government you are missing the point if youre in this camp greenwald urges of course dutiful loyal supporters of the president and his policies good citizens who do nothing to attract negative attention from the powerful have no reason to fear the surveillance state this is the case in every society those who pose no challenge are rarely targeted by oppressive measures and from their perspective they can then convince themselves that oppression does not really exist but the true measure of a societys freedom is how it treats its dissidents and other marginalized groups not how it treats good loyalists we shouldnt have to be faithful loyalists of the powerful to feel safe from state surveillance nor should the price of immunity be refraining from controversial or provocative dissent we shouldnt want a society where the message is conveyed that you will be left alone only if you mimic the accommodating behavior and conventional wisdom of a washington establishment columnist reading about all the disclosures again woven together and in context i couldnt decide which was worse the nsas massive grim overreach in the hands of director michael hayden—or the complicity of almost every other entity involved private as well as public prism is a team sport trumpeted one nsa memo too true other memos and slides show google yahoo facebook and microsoft easing the way toward surveillance of their users twitter was the exception in this case when the guardian and the washington post broke that news the tech companies tried to argue otherwise based on a technicality but looking back the documents give the lie to silicon valleys denials of cooperation as greenwald writes i will be reading this most likely eventually after i read everything else im

            "text": "A few little Moments in Detroit ™ have befallen me lately. I should share:\n\nSince the weather turned warm, I’ve been doing some so-called last-mile commuting, which is what urban planners call it when you ride a bike to a transit stop, load it onto the bus or light rail or whatever, then unload it at your destination stop and finish the last leg to your office. It’s great so far; the building manager overruled the security guard who told me I had to leave the bike chained to a parking meter outside, so I take it up to the office. At lunchtime, I’m no longer confined to the Subway and Rub Pub on either side of our building, or even the places farther away — I can ride to the Eastern Market and get a slice of Supino’s pizza or a sandwich from the Russell Street Deli, which has Subway beat by a unit so large, it no longer makes sense to measure it in miles.\n\nLast Friday I was cruisin’ into work on the bus, looking forward to the weekend, when an alarm started beeping in the engine compartment. The driver got on the horn with HQ, then pulled over and told us we’d be waiting for another bus or a repair, whichever came first.\n\nThis was the point when I realized just how important last-mile commuting is. I took the bike down from the rack and announced it was time for Plan B. I rode off Jefferson and into a terrible neighborhood, one burned-and-blighted house after another. And then, as though into Emerald City, I was in Indian Village, a stately neighborhood of older homes. A few blocks of this and back into the dodgy districts. Five men walked toward me, spread across the road, and I wondered if it was wise to stay on course. Decided to smile and wave, and they smiled and waved back, just a pod of local rummies getting their morning drink on, it looked like.\n\nThen, huzzah, a bike lane. And a cemetery, final resting place of Sonic Smith. Some deteriorated light industrial, a new high school, this, that, a casino, downtown and my office. Five miles, roughly. I should do this more often. A perfect morning for a little bike ride.\n\nThen today I had to appear on a local radio show, to discuss this story. I walked into the lobby, and who should be there but Sixto Rodriguez, the “Searching for Sugarman” guy. He’d just stopped by to make a cash donation.\n\n“I really like your show, Craig,” he said. I guess he didn’t want to wait for another pledge campaign. A guy I know who used to work at the station says he does it all the time — just swings by from time to time to drop a fifty into the tip jar. Now that’s what I call public-radio support.\n\nRodriguez gives away a lot of his money. His daughter quotes him as saying once you have the food-clothing-shelter part handled, all the rest is icing. He shares the icing.\n\nSo, now I’m watching a few days of 80-degree weather blow out with a thunderstorm, with a 25-degree drop ahead for the next few days. We put the boat in Friday. Balls.\n\nSome good bloggage today. Let’s start with a category called Fiery Oratory. Emily Bazelon reviews Glenn Greenwald’s new book in Slate:\n\nA million jokesters have invited the NSA to listen in on their calls about feeding the cat or picking up the kids, noting that most Americans aren’t doing anything exciting enough to interest the government. You are missing the point if you’re in this camp, Greenwald urges: Of course, dutiful, loyal supporters of the president and his policies, good citizens who do nothing to attract negative attention from the powerful, have no reason to fear the surveillance state. This is the case in every society: those who pose no challenge are rarely targeted by oppressive measures, and from their perspective, they can then convince themselves that oppression does not really exist. But the true measure of a society’s freedom is how it treats its dissidents and other marginalized groups, not how it treats good loyalists. … We shouldn’t have to be faithful loyalists of the powerful to feel safe from state surveillance. Nor should the price of immunity be refraining from controversial or provocative dissent. We shouldn’t want a society where the message is conveyed that you will be left alone only if you mimic the accommodating behavior and conventional wisdom of a Washington establishment columnist. …Reading about all the disclosures again, woven together and in context, I couldn’t decide which was worse: the NSA’s massive, grim overreach, in the hands of Director Michael Hayden—or the complicity of almost every other entity involved, private as well as public. “PRISM is a team sport!” trumpeted one NSA memo. Too true: Other memos and slides show Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Microsoft easing the way toward surveillance of their users. (Twitter was the exception in this case.) When the Guardian and the Washington Post broke that news, the tech companies tried to argue otherwise based on a technicality. But looking back, the documents “give the lie to Silicon Valley’s denials of cooperation,” as Greenwald writes.\n\nI will be reading this, most likely. Eventually. After I read everything else I’m supposed to read. Someone recently recommended “Hellhound on His Trail,” the story of the manhunt for James Earl Ray, describing how great it was, etc., and all I could think was, dammit, another one.\n\nMore fiery oratory, from Gene Weingarten, speaking at Joe McGinniss’ memorial service:\n\nWhen a writer enters into an agreement with a source to tell his story, there is always an accompanying covenant. This will be acknowledged by, you know, every journalist who is not too stupid or full of himself to notice what is going on. In return for fair and objective reporting, the subject is promising to tell the truth. If the subject lies to the writer, all bets are off. The degree to which this principle attaches is directly proportional to the enormity of the lie that was told.\n\nHe’s speaking of the teapot tempest that followed a New Yorker piece that was about “Fatal Vision,” called “The Journalist and the Murderer.” The writer, Janet Malcolm, implied that McGinniss had betrayed Jeffrey MacDonald somehow, and… Just read the link.\n\nI was in a group looking at some data regarding Michigan’s charter schools when someone recollected that charters were supposed to be educational trailblazers, and that’s why they were freed from many of the constraints traditional schools have — so they could run ahead and blaze a trail.\n\nNot so much anymore. Not in New York, anyway:\n\nA primary rationale for the creation of charter schools, which are publicly financed and privately run, was to develop test kitchens for practices that could be exported into the traditional schools. President Obama, in recently proclaiming “National Charter Schools Week,” said they “can provide effective approaches for the broader public education system.” But two decades since the schools began to appear, educators from both systems concede that very little of what has worked for charter schools has found its way into regular classrooms. Testy political battles over space and money, including one that became glaringly public in New York State this spring, have inhibited attempts at collaboration. The sharing of school buildings, which in theory should foster communication, has more frequently led to conflict. And some charter schools have veered so sharply from the traditional model — with longer school years, armies of nonunion workers and flashy enrichment opportunities like trips to the Galápagos Islands — that their ideas are viewed as unworkable in regular schools.\n\nFinally, I know Christopher Columbus long ago lost his luster with most people, but I was raised in Columbus, Ohio, and I will always read a story about the old Genoan. And this one is pretty interesting; scientists think they might have found the wreckage of the Santa Maria.\n\nA lot for a Wednesday, I know, but hey — eat up.",

Our Nation can only realize this idea through the guarantee of a world-class education for every child. During National Charter Schools Week, we pay tribute to the role our Nation's public charter schools play in advancing opportunity, and we salute the parents, educators, community leaders, policymakers, and philanthropists who gave rise to the charter school sector.\n\nAs independent public schools, charter schools have the ability to try innovative approaches to teaching and learning in the classroom. This flexibility comes with high standards and accountability; charter schools must demonstrate that all their students are progressing toward academic excellence. Those that do not measure up can be shut down. And those that are successful can provide effective approaches for the broader public education system. They can show what is possible -- schools that give every student the chance to prepare for college and career and to develop a love of learning that lasts a lifetime.\n\nAmericans pursue individual success, but we also understand that we have a stake in each other. If we make an investment in every child, then all our children will enjoy a stronger Nation and a brighter world. This week, let us do our part to ensure our young people can go as far as their passions and hard work will take them, and recommit to restoring the American dream for generations to come.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 4 through May 10, 2014, as National Charter Schools Week. I commend our Nation's charter schools, teachers, and administrators, and I call on States and communities to support high quality public schools, including charter schools and the students they serve. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand fourteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-eighth.",

same families — warm and fuzzy cooperation said bruce fuller a professor of education and public policy at the university of california berkeley and all that money is drained away from public schools

            "text": "Amidst all the debate about charter schools, one thing has often been left out. They are not delivering on what their advocates claimed they would do, as the New York Times reports:\n\nA primary rationale for the creation of charter schools, which are publicly financed and privately run, was to develop test kitchens for practices that could be exported into the traditional schools. President Obama, in recently proclaiming “National Charter Schools Week,” said they “can provide effective approaches for the broader public education system.” But two decades since the schools began to appear, educators from both systems concede that very little of what has worked for charter schools has found its way into regular classrooms. Testy political battles over space and money, including one that became glaringly public in New York State this spring, have inhibited attempts at collaboration. The sharing of school buildings, which in theory should foster communication, has more frequently led to conflict.\n\nNow, I’d push back a bit here. “What has worked” is typically how these questions get framed, where the presumption is higher test scores are the goal and a school that gets higher test scores is ‘working’ or ‘successful’.  I’m not convinced that higher test scores area  particularly useful way of understanding education (which isn’t to say they are useless, just limited) And this leaves aside pesky questions like whether schools are selecting students who are likely to do better on these tests and getting rid of those who won’t.\n\nI never bought the idea that charters would develop solutions we didn’t already know about in education. We do know what works. We systematically provide fewer resources and a punitive, non-supportive environment to students on the basis of race and class. That’s just another way of saying we provide a worse education to those students who need the most, because of systematic disadvantages.  Students need schools that aren’t crumbling, that have libraries and counselors, that have air conditioners, that have enough textbooks for everyone on the first day of class. They need teachers and administrators who treat them like they count, not like a threat, who adopt an ethic of caring, not of test and punish. They need eyeglasses and dental care. They need food. And safety.\n\nWe want schools that are safe, humane, child-centered places where young people are treated like intelligent human beings. That means we have to end the racist zero tolerance discipline policies and the policing of school hallways that, for thousands of mostly black and brown students, is the first step into what is often called a school-to-prison pipeline. We need to end stop-and-frisk in the schools, just like we need to end it in the streets. Changing the culture of our schools means making the curriculum culturally relevant, and allowing our students to be critically minded and outspoken, allowing them to speak their languages and have those languages respected, valued and nurtured.\n\nPart of the reason is that ‘accountability” reformers have been pushing two ideas that are in tension. First, that charters would be collaborative laboratories for public schools and second that ‘school choice’ would improve education. But the latter, the value that has clearly been the dominant one, undermines the former.\n\nEducation experts said it might prove difficult to encourage the kind of sharing of ideas that charter schools were originally supposed to foster, given competitive dynamics. Charter schools serve about 5 percent of public-school students nationwide, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, up from about 1 percent in 2003. In some cities, like Detroit, New Orleans and Washington, the percentages are much higher. (In New York, it is 6 percent.) “It’s like putting a Burger King kitty-corner to a McDonald’s and expecting — in the same location and competing for the same families — warm and fuzzy cooperation,” said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAnd all that money is drained away from public schools that were already underfunded.\n\nBut instead of addressing this, or at least making sure that charters are properly regulated, both parties are pushing for more charter expansion with few limits., as Zoë Carpenter reports.\n\nOn Friday, lawmakers in the House largely missed an opportunity to strengthen oversight of charter schools, passing a bill to encourage charter school growth by boosting federal funding without including several amendments that were offered to increase transparency and accountability.

Fighting inequality will help education, but education does not fight inequality.\n\nGiven the promise, charters are only “successful” if they improve “achievement” beyond their own students–but they don’t. Some individual charter schools may be doing great things. But it isn’t a policy solution and it’s a distraction from long-standing problems. Insufficient innovation was never the problem. Racism and inequality were–and are.\n\nAnd that’s a key point that is often lost for many critics.  Charters and other market solutions aren’t the core problem either. But they make it harder to address the core problem.  It’s essential to not lose sight of either point.",

all those bad teachers ravitch doesnt know what public ed is charter schs tied to turkish imam fr si1 i recently read the book lone survivor the eyewitness account of operation redwing and the lost heroes of seal team 10 wwwamazoncomexecobidosasin0316044695tilsoncapitalpar and also attended a dinner with a member of seal team 6 i am in awe of these brave men and the sacrifices they make for our country i am also in awe of how they are trained motivated managed and led which raises the question is seal team 6 as great as it is primarily because of the superstar individuals that comprise it or does the greatness lie mainly in the whole the structure training leadership etc the reason im thinking about this is because for the 22 of the children in this country who live in poverty and in many cases also suffer from poor diethealth few books in the house a single poorly educated parent who may not even speak english etc to have any chance in life they dont need average schools or even good schools – they need the educational equivalent of seal team 6 that may seem like an impossibly high bar but its not ive personally visited dozens of schools – part of the kipp uncommon af success uplift yes prep etc networks – that are the educational equivalents of seal team 6 obviously we should be trying to replicate these schools as quickly as possible obvious to any unconflicted person with a brain and a heart anyway – i realize that excludes large numbers of people so one key question is should we be focusing our efforts on superstar teachers classroom level or at the school level for years i thought the former focusing on teachers like jaime escalante rafe esquith and harriett ball but now i think the latter for four primary reasons a there arent enough superstar teachers and well never be able to findtrain enough b a superstar teacher can move a kid a long way in a year but rarely is a childs overall life trajectory changed by one year with even the greatest teacher c superstar teachers burn out at a high rate and d as neerav kingsland who is one of the panelists after the showing of the experiment on monday points out the same person can be a dud in one school environment and a superstar in another lets take two lawyers – topthird tina went to harvard law and bottomthird barry went to lower tier law school both pass the bar exam due to magical forces they do not get to choose where they work sound familiar interestingly enough they are assigned to the same law firm it happens to be a mediocre firm and heres what happens · neither tina nor barry gets trained since law school doesnt really teach you anything about daytoday practice of law both struggle tina works harder attempts to train herself and starts improving – but at the end of the day her efforts are marginal she outperforms barry but not by much neither really knows how to practice law at the end of their second year each gets a below average on the states law practitioner valueadded system now lets rerun the scenario this time tina and barry both get placed at an excellent law firm heres what happens · both tina and barry get superb onthejob training they each attend intensive summer training and for their first year they are assigned to a topnotch lawyer for mentorship they are consistently coached given feedback and evaluated their second year each is allowed to handle cases on their own by the end of her second year tina is on the partner track shes impressed everyone barry struggles with the high expectations but learns a lot and improves at the end of their second year each gets their valueadded score tina scores an above average and barry scores average now lets apply this to education – heres what we might see · in average to poorly managed schools the impact of the institution itself will drown out a lot of potential variance in effectiveness nobody gets trained or supported few people excel · however in a wellrun school two things will happen 1 all teachers will improve and 2 the talented teachers will show a significant effect that was not picked up in the poorly run school this is my theory at least why well it seems logical institutions matter 2 re the charter schools contribute to segregation nonsense i addressed in my last email heres more from the national alliance for public charter schools charter opponents sometimes conduct studies asking whether the racial and economic composition of charter schools is perfectly reflective of the sending traditional school district see miron et al february 2010 the unsurprising result is no most charters do not look exactly like the nearby school districts and the authors then draw conclusions suggesting problematic racial segregation in charters the obvious flaw here however is the comparison between a charter school and a traditional district if we want to criticize charters for not being perfectly reflective of a broader area we should also ask the same question of traditional schools that is how well do the traditional school campuses reflect the broader districts racial composition when we ask this question we generally find that neither charters nor traditional schools are reflective of the broader district or community a report with data from many large cities comparing charter school populations to the rest of the school system is at

you very meaningful progress and strategies going on in dallas tx the 14th largest school district in the country with 160000 students 95 nonanglo 87 socioeconomic disadvantaged due to the work of a dedicated group of reformers the following key strategic initiatives have been accomplished in just the last 12 months i created leadership disd an nonprofit organization formed to traineducate 50100 passionate citizens annually regarding what they need to know to play a leadership in our school district and serving as a great pipeline to identify new school board trustees ii educatedallas a pac originated by the local business chamber to raise money to support reformist candidates and iii dallas kids first a grassroots pac with 500 members parents teachers etc and growing fast that is focused on electioneeringcanvassingget out the vote efforts together these efforts have created a robust pipeline of identified future trustees and in this cycle raised five times the amount of money historically raised for a school board election and almost doubled the turnout in the three board elections that occurred this last saturday with the pacendorsed reformist candidate winning every election we now have a solid reformist board which will build upon the recent policy successes enacted in just the last year including i performance over seniority in all reassignmenttermination decisions ii elimination of the forced placement of ineffective teachers on unwilling principals iii authorization of a new teacher evaluation system meaningfully incorporating student outcomes and iv execution of a fiveyear contract with teach for america reportedly the longest contract that tfa has ever signed with an urban school district in its history on top of those efforts we recently hired mike miles from colorado springs as our new superintendent a former west pointarmy ranger and broad fellow who announced in the last week a very studentfocused mission focused on substantially improving teacher and leadership quality he has announced that he will be conducting a national search to hire a new chief of schools a new chief academic officer and 50 new principal candidates who will be trained to assume school leadership in the fall of 2013 see link to opportunities below finally in the last year we formed i commit a backbone infrastructure organization similar to the strive effort within cincinnati serving all of dallas county 25 million people and 800000 children ages 022 and focused on scaling best practices across the region and helping coordinate state and local funding towards those efforts proven by data to be most effective and ii the teaching trust an urban school leadership masters program housed on the campus of smu and founded in part by the founder of uplift education the regions largest public school network uplift now has 25 schools that will stabilize at over 13000 students and has 10000 students on its wait list in addition the local kipp network will be adding two more schools in fall 2013 with a new mayor mike rawlings elected in june 2011 on a platform to raise up and strongly support our public schools and the knowledge that change is made easier with texas being a righttowork state all of us are excited about the accelerated progress and prospects for our children and want people nationally to know about the significant

tensions between district and charter schools with a new collaboration set to kick off in the bronx the districtcharter compact is made up of public district schools and 85 charter schools across the city and will start with a bronx study tour program for educators to share their best practices i think up until now charters and districts havent had a lot of communication said ken baum principal of one of the participating schools the urban assembly school for applied math and science its a wonderful opportunity to get people talking and share things we do well the initiative launched with financial support from the bill and melinda gates foundation will officially start in june with panels and meetings other model bronx schools that have put out the welcome mat include eagle academy for young men kipp academy middle school and bronx charter school for excellence in each school educators can observe classes participate in professional development sessions and discuss common techniques im looking forward to really begin sharing ideas regardless of what our models are said charlene reid head of the bronx charter school for excellence we all have the same goals were all nyc educators were excited to open up our doors for all educators who want to inquire and begin to work together because these are all the same students in the bronx and we want to deliver for them parent activist mona davids who has a daughter at equality charter school in the bronx said she hopes participants include the ones who need this initiative most struggling schools and schools on the chopping block they need to go and partner with the schools already on the hit list and the schools that have received consecutive cs ds and fs and give them the support that they need said davids president of nyc parents union since charters are supposed to be labs for innovation i think they should be partnering with failing district schools 5 the wsjs lisa fleisher with more on the strong steps bloomberg and walcott are taking with a great quote at the end about terrible teachers after years of trying to oust ineffective teachers by reforming the system the bloomberg administration is turning to options it already has available to try to prune the weakest educators from its ranks schools chancellor dennis walcott said thursday the district would move to fire teachers who receive low ratings due to incompetence in two consecutive years if a new teacherevaluation system isnt in place by the time school starts this fall he also proposed offering buyouts to teachers who have been floating in the system for more than a year without permanent classroom positions the value of the buyouts would have to be negotiated with the teachers union ridding schools of poorly performing teachers has been one of mayor michael bloombergs highest priorities but his attempts to make sweeping institutional changes havent always succeeded against union resistance he lost a fight last year to end seniority protections during layoffs and efforts to fire teachers for incompetence have been slow joanne pezzolo a highschool english teacher from staten island said she would jump at the chance to take a buyout but at age 53 she said she cant afford one unless its about half her 79000 annual salary ms pezzolo who was cut from a school that had declining enrollment said she sees both sides of the argument she hated traveling among schools and believed there was a stigma attached to teachers in the atr pool but when she found a longerterm spot at a school in brooklyns cobble hill she said she saw some atrocious teachers one man came in put his coat over his head dragged a few chairs together and went to sleep she recalled other teachers refused to leave their drivers licenses at the front desk in exchange for a bathroom key they shouldnt get a buyout she said they shouldnt even get a paycheck they should just be fired 6 speaking of terrible teachers ravitch denies their existence i thought and thought but i couldnt remember a single teacher in my own experience or that of my children or grandchildren who was a drunkonthejob teacher i went to ordinary public schools in houston and i had my share of ordinary teachers i remember someone told me once that if you have even one great teacher in your lifetime you are blessed i was doubly blessed as i had at least two but i must say i never came across any of the horrible men or women who seem to give the reformers sleepless nights if they exist and i suppose they must then they should be fired in their first year on the job if not then their principal is not doing his or her job note how she talks about how she went to ordinary public schools in houston in an era long before unions made it impossible to get rid of terrible teachers and then mentions her own children leaving the reader with the clear impression that they too went to public schools not this is typical ravitch disingenuousness which is much more common that outright lies though she tells plenty of those too in fact ravitch sent her children to the private super elite super expensive tuition this year is 38710 see httpwwwdaltonorgpodiumdefaultaspxt153746 dalton school on the upper east side smack in the middle of the wealthiest census tract in the us diane ravitch sent her sons to private school according to the washington post assistant secretary diane s ravitch who lived in new york city before moving to washington last year sent her nowgrown sons to private schools washington post 5592 note this was reprinted in the houston chronicle ravitchs two sons went to dalton a selective manhattan prep school according to a new york times article titled school choice where they send their own diane ravitch research professor of education at new york university where two sons an investment banker and a writer went to the selective manhattan prep school dalton why in the mid and late 60s public schools in

mathematics they were extremely well prepared for college new york times 8303 ravitch wishes all children had the education hers received at a progressive private school according to a review of one

literature and with great teachers who made ideas come alive radical teacher 32204 an article about diane ravitchs exhusband mentions that their two sons went the private dalton school according to the new york times most distressing of all state and city school officials say is that mr ravitchs handson experience in elementary and secondary education is almost nonexistent limited to a brief stint as chairman of the board of the dalton school the elite private academy on the upper east side that his two sons attended in the 1970s new york times 91795 to be clear i live in that very census tract and send my three daughters to a similarly elite expensive private school – but theres one difference i dont try to hide this fact union hacks have tried to make hay of this but my answer is simple ive seen the difference a highquality education has made in my life and the lives of my children so all im fighting for is for every child to have the same opportunity 7 rishawn biddle takes on ravitch and other education traditionalists one of the mostamazing aspects of the battle over the reform of american public education is that the lack of thoughtfulness among education traditionalists in their defense of failed policies and practices that have done little more than condemn 12 million children a year to poverty and prison this is especially true when it comes to how teaching and curricula should be provided to kids and whether the families that love them should be able to choose and shape the conditions in which their kids should learn from where they sit public education cant possibly include public charter schools publiclyfinanced school voucher programs or even online providers paid by states and chosen by families because these are operations that arent run by traditional districts with elected or mayorappointed school boards and executives this is why they constantly try to argue that charters – which are run by nonprofit and corporate entities — arent public schools even when they are clearly defined as such under state and federal law and why they argue that the very existence of charters is an affront to local control by school districts and it is why folks such as oncerespectable and now largelydiscredited educational historian diane ravitch constantly proclaim as she does today that moves such as louisiana gov bobby jindals successful effort to expand the states voucher program to serve as many as 300000 more students is dismantling public education reformers know this collective line of argument is one of the mosttiresome and infantile education traditionalists make and one that is the mostcircular this is because traditionalists base their notions not on facts or data but on mistaken interpretations of the very laws that govern public education in this country yet it is important to constantly point out this faulty antiintellectual thinking why because challenging the illogic posed in traditionalist arguments is key to advancing reform 8 case study 5347341 of the unions defending any teacher no matter how bad from eag wisconsin union defends former teacher imprisoned for molesting student the strange case of kurt kostelecky has cost taxpayers at least 64000 wausaukee wis to more fully understand the destructive influence big labor has on public schools consider the case of a former wisconsin teacher kurt kostelecky kostelecky was convicted last summer for having sexual contact with a freshman female student during the 200809 school year and is currently serving a 10year prison term he claims the student came on to him and he couldnt say no but that doesnt mean kosteleckys former employer the wausaukee school district can wash its hands of him the convicted child molester was a member of the wisconsin education association council which is still waging a legal fight on his behalf weac is suing the district over allegations it improperly reduced kosteleckys teaching load as retribution because he challenged district policies back in 2009 reports fox11onlinecom an internet search indicates that kostelecky taught shop class for the district and had his teaching load reduced from fiveeighths of a fulltime teaching position to threeeighths in 2009 the district was facing a budget deficit and claims the reduction in hours was an effort to save money the union says it was an effort to convince a troublemaking teacher to resign the news outlet reports the fact that kostelecky is now a convicted child molester and was only a parttime teacher who shouldve thought twice about shooting his mouth off hasnt stopped the union from continuing its lawsuit which has dragged on for three years and cost taxpayers at least 64000 not only is the union wasting taxpayers money – probably enough to pay the salary and benefits of a beginning teacher – its also frittering away weac members dues dollars on a pointless lawsuit the kostelecky case is a perfect example of how teacher unions cause dissension within a community and waste school dollars on issues that dont benefit children in the least weac has been on quite a losing streak lately as kathleen falk s defeat in last weeks recall primary election demonstrates by lawyering up on behalf of a convicted child molester it seems the union wants to prove that its still relevant regardless wausaukee taxpayers cant be too impressed with the unions wasteful behavior and we suspect rankandfile weac members arent impressed either 9 60 minutes did a segment on a network of charter schools run by a turkish imam trying

aired on may 13 2012 lesley stahl is the correspondent shachar baron producer over the past decade scores of charter schools have popped up all over the us all sharing some common features most of them are highachieving academically they stress math and science and one more thing theyre founded and largely run by immigrants from turkey who are carrying out the teachings of a turkish islamic cleric fethullah gulen hes the spiritual leader of a growing and increasingly influential force in the muslim world known as the gulen movement with millions upon millions of disciples who compare him to ghandi and martin luther king gulen promotes tolerance interfaith dialog and aboveall he promotes education and yet hes a mystery man hes never seen or heard in public and the more power he gains the more questions are raised about his motives and the schools 10 harlem village academies got hugh jackman to tape a funny teacher recruiting video for them wwwfacebookcomphotophpv314744511933633 248 april 26 2012 – 256 pm by neerav kingsland 1 comment httptitleonederlandblogsthompsoncom20120426topthirdtinabottomthirdbarry theres been some good blogging lately on how to interpret the studies on teach for america tfa teacher effectiveness – see matthew di carlo and adam ozimek but neither addresses the research from a relinquisher standpoint heres what they say matts takeaway tfa teachers are by most standards talented – ie they went to selective universities graduated at the top of their class are motivated and work hard but they dont dramatically outperform traditional teachers so perhaps that link between recruiting talented teachers and increasing test scores isnt as tight as it might seem adams takeaway tfa teachers get five weeks of training and achieve roughly the same results as teachers who go through much longer universitybased training programs so imagine what talented tfatype folks could do if they actually had more training both interesting points and well worth thinking more about and newer research coming out may show even stronger tfa effects but there seems to be a limit to what we can extrapolate from these studies as the tfa studies only tell us how well tfa teachers compare to other teachers when everyone is teaching in generally mediocre schools that operate in a government monopoly in the studies the system is a given now if youre a relinquisher who believes government should regulate but not operate schools immediate questions arise – primary amongst them do these studies tell us anything about how different teachers achieve in different environments not really heres an analogy lets take two lawyers – topthird tina went to harvard law and bottomthird barry went to lower tier law school both pass the bar exam due to magical forces they do not get to choose where they work sound familiar interestingly enough they are assigned to the same law firm it happens to be a mediocre firm and heres what happens now lets rerun the scenario this time tina and barry both get placed at an excellent law firm heres what happens now lets apply this to education – heres what we might see this is my theory at least why well it seems logical institutions matter also many highperforming charter schools recruit heavily from tfa which leads me to believe that in highperforming environments tfa teachers add a lot of value especially when they are trained correctly and given increasing responsibility as they develop – and of course they are most likely cost effective as well the takeaway in some schools topthird tina and bottomthird barry will perform roughly the same after two years in others they will not thats my hunch at least but unfortunately we have no idea if this is true because the tfa studies only measure how well tfa teachers perform in mediocre schools so heres me bowing out of the tfa research debate until someone does further research that is tom kane linda darling hammond roland fryer eric hanushek doug harris we await your work neerav kingsland is chief strategy officer of new schools for new orleans friday may 18 2012 earlier this week napcs published a report on public charter schools meeting the diverse demands of their communities this question of diversity particularly racial and socioeconomic diversity is important to all public schools including public charter schools groups such as uclas civil rights project pay close attention to racial segregation in all public schools and continue to find for example that the children in united states schools are much poorer than they were decades ago and more separated in highly unequal schools unfortunately many charter school opponents have seized this very real issue and misused it as an opportunity to bash charter schools just do a simple google search on segregation and charter schools and you will find numerous hits in which news outlets or websites uncritically repeat the allegations of fervent charter bashers these claims reappear every so often and the problems are many let me name a few 1 shotgun reports analyses that take this shotgun approach present tables upon tables of data aiming to show somehow that charter schools are simultaneously schools of white flight that cream only the best students and miserable places in which poor children are trapped each day each of these conflicting claims is then backed up with an isolated example or two of a heavily white or heavily minority charter school of course such reports make no mention of the numerous heavily white or heavily minority traditional schools surrounding the charter schools in question 2 datafree studies some reports make almost no attempt to gather data these reports often include phrases like charter schools are among the most segregated in the district for example the nea today website points to a march newspaper article and claims that some of the nations most segregated schools are charter schools where students are often isolated by race income language and special education status while this blanket claim may be true depending upon how segregation is defined it is also true that the other segregated schools indeed most of the segregated schools are traditional schools this is often the case in districts that are heavily segregated by neighborhoods where the traditional schools are also segregated 3 compared to perfection charter opponents sometimes conduct studies asking whether the racial and economic composition of charter schools is perfectly reflective of the sending traditional school district see miron et al february 2010 the unsurprising result is no most charters do not look exactly like the nearby school districts and the authors then draw conclusions suggesting problematic racial segregation in charters the obvious flaw here however is the comparison between a charter school and a traditional district if we want to criticize charters for not being perfectly reflective of a broader area we should also ask the same question of traditional schools that is how well do the traditional school campuses reflect the broader districts racial composition when we ask this question we generally find that neither charters nor traditional schools are reflective of the broader district or community check out the graph below showing data for a large southern district the yaxis represents the number of schools within the bands represented on the xaxis for example two of the schools in the district had minority student percentages between 200 percent and 249 percent while 13 schools had minority student percentages between 95 percent and 100 percent and so on the takeaway point here is that most of the traditional public schools do not reflect the overall district in a district with 78 percent minority students half of the schools are heavily minority schools 90 percent or more minority students and onequarter of the schools are disproportionately white green bars show the only diverse schools in the district consequently the relevant question is not whether charter schools reflect the broader district the question is whether charter schools are more or less reflective of the district than the traditional public schools in the broader community 4 studies at the state or national level a perfect example of this type of analysis is a february 2010 study by the aforementioned civil rights project crp titled choice without equity charter school segregation and the need for civil rights standards the key flaw in this oftreferenced study is that the crp authors focus on the fraction of students in highly segregated minority schools and compare the figure for all charter schools to that of all traditional public schools this is clearly an inappropriate analytic strategy because the geographic placement of public charter schools practically ensures that they will enroll higher percentages of minorities than will the average traditional school as we show in our 2010 education next article with the data attached so that anyone can choose to review or reanalyze it our more appropriate analytic strategy clearly demonstrates how the crp authors overstated their findings these are simply examples of the numerous ways to unfairly attack charter schools based on the demographic characteristics of the students that they serve there are many others indeed some reports use no data at all but simply make reference to other flawed studies and yet the conclusions drawn by these reports are treated as new by those eager to bash charter schools see for example the recent report called chartering equity that was used by charter critics to show that segregation is fostered by public charter schools we have worked on this a great deal and have tried to figure out the best way to assess the relative racial integration and segregation at charter schools it is complicated and requires that the researchers make several decisions which can be debated about how to define integration or segregation nevertheless in recent years some studies have done a good job of attacking this question see for example the thorough analysis by the rand corporation in 2009 good studies such as this generally compare the relative integration or the racial compositions of charter schools to that of nearby traditional public schools thoughtful analyses find that students who move into charter schools mostly choose schools with racial compositions similar to those of the traditional public schools they exited these results are not uniform they vary state by state for example we find in florida that charter schools and traditional public schools are similar in their reflectiveness of the broader community in delaware however charters are not as reflective of the community as are traditional public schools results also vary by metropolitan area in philadelphia 65 percent of the students in both charters and traditional schools attend highly segregated schools in atlanta only 25 percent of charter students attend highly segregated schools while 70 percent of traditional public schools students attend such segregated schools of course schools charters or traditional that are the most segregated sit in geographic areas with high concentrations of poor and minority students these families have the fewest choices when they are dissatisfied with the schooling options they have charters often open to serve these disadvantaged students these are issues related to poverty and residential segregation — these are not charter problems in short the claims that charter schools enhance segregation across the board are most certainly false and more than likely a thinlyveiled attempt of charter opponents to slow the charter movement and limit choices options and to cast these attacks as a defense of racial integration is simply disingenuous for example the majority of students in center cities in both the public charter sector and in the traditional public sector attend intensely segregated minority schools we know this any casual observer of urban schools knows this and the critics of charter schools know this thus anyone truly interested in racial integration for students and not simply interested in attacking charter schools is looking in the wrong direction by focusing on the failings of charter schools charters serve fewer than three percent of us public school children the remaining 97 percent are compelled to attend traditional public schools anyone genuinely concerned with enhancing racial integration should be channeling their energy toward reducing segregation in the traditional sector finally when critics use the term segregation to malign charter schools it might be viewed as disrespectful to those who have suffered from formalized segregation in the past or to those who currently suffer from residential segregation it does not seem to be the right term to use when referring to the results of active choices made by families of minority students segregation connotes a lack of freedom this situation feels like the opposite the fact that some poor students are free to flee segregated traditional public schools for similarly segregated charters can not be viewed as an indictment of charters indeed leaders of charter organizations are quick to state that they are honored to serve minority families who choose the charter schools after a search for attractive schooling options it is simply wrong to compare these active parental choices to the forced segregation of our nations past gary w ritter professor of education and public policy university of arkansas after years of trying to oust ineffective teachers by reforming the system the bloomberg administration is turning to options it already has available to try to prune the weakest educators from its ranks schools chancellor dennis walcott said thursday the district would move to fire teachers who receive low ratings due to incompetence in two consecutive years if a new teacherevaluation system isnt in place by the time school starts this fall he also proposed offering buyouts to teachers who have been floating in the system for more than a year without permanent classroom positions the value of the buyouts would have to be negotiated with the teachers union ridding schools of poorly performing teachers has been one of mayor michael bloombergs highest priorities but his attempts to make sweeping institutional changes havent always succeeded against union resistance he lost a fight last year to end seniority protections during layoffs and efforts to fire teachers for incompetence have been slow the buyouts are intended to put a dent in a group of about 830 teachers who have been unable to find jobs in the citys public schools but have tenure protection about 475 currently would be eligible for a buyout and most of the group would be eligible by autumn some teachers in the socalled absent teacher reserve pool were let go by their principals while others were in schools that were closed by the city a few were previously in the infamous rubber rooms where teachers facing disciplinary procedures did little work while collecting paychecks every dollar we save we can use to benefit our students instead of wasting it on teachers who probably chose the wrong profession mr walcott said during an address at the sheraton hotel in midtown manhattan the average salary for teachers in the pool is 82420 but the city saved about 5 million this year by using them as substitutes throughout the system similar buyouts have been used in washington dc dallas and houston with offers of for instance 20000 for the most senior teachers mr walcott said new yorks would be more attractive than any weve seen across the nation—for teachers and for the taxpayers of new york city he didnt however provide an estimated cost of the proposal in his speech mr walcott said the city was spending 100 million on the salaries for teachers in the pool but his office later said the figure was 685 million for salaries a number that jumped to 93 million when benefits costs were included michael mulgrew president of the united federation of teachers said the union has approached both mr walcott and his predecessor to propose buyouts but were brushed back he called the plan a nice change of heart it would have been easier if mr walcott called me first he said he might have been able to do a speech about how its already done and negotiated he questioned why mr bloomberg has waited so long to try to fire teachers with two straight years of an unsatisfactory rating a power the administration has always had but left up to principals discretion of the roughly 75000 city teachers 235 have been rated unsatisfactory for incompetence for two consecutive years like districts throughout new york state the city has been negotiating with its teachers union over a new evaluation system that makes it easier to fire teachers under state law the city must have a new fourtiered jobperformance review in place by january or lose a small amount of state funding the absent teacher reserve pool was established in the 2005 teachers contract when forced jobplacement within the school system ended both teachers and principals had to accept each other or teachers would be on the payroll without a permanent position often serving as longterm substitutes this year teachers without permanent positions have been assigned to schools as substitutes for a week at a time after the week is up they rotate to another school the department of education said this was intended as a sort of speeddating introduce as many teachers and principals as possible and hope they find a match but critics called the procedure a hardship intended to push out teachers by forcing them to commute to different locations across the city joanne pezzolo a highschool english teacher from staten island said she would jump at the chance to take a buyout but at age 53 she said she cant afford one unless its about half her 79000 annual salary ms pezzolo who was cut from a school that had declining enrollment said she sees both sides of the argument she hated traveling among schools and believed there was a stigma attached to teachers in the atr pool but when she found a longerterm spot at a school in brooklyns cobble hill she said she saw some atrocious teachers one man came in put his coat over his head dragged a few chairs together and went to sleep she recalled other teachers refused to leave their drivers licenses at the front desk in exchange for a bathroom key they shouldnt get a buyout she said they shouldnt even get a paycheck they should just be fired may 10 2012 httpdianeravitchnet20120510whataboutallthosebadteachers marc tucker has an interesting blog today in education week httpblogsedweekorgedweektopperformers201205teacherqualityandteacheraccountabilityhtml about teachers he recounts his many encounters with incompetent drunkonthejob teachers but he uses this beginning to say that we really need to give more thought to helping teachers encouraging the best teachers and improving the conditions of teachers so as to attract excellent candidates in the future i thought and thought but i couldnt remember a single teacher in my own experience or that of my children or grandchildren who was a drunkonthejob teacher i went to ordinary public schools in houston and i had my share of ordinary teachers i remember someone told me once that if you have even one great teacher in your lifetime you are blessed i was doubly blessed as i had at least two but i must say i never came across any of the horrible men or women who seem to give the reformers sleepless nights if they exist and i suppose they must then they should be fired in their first year on the job if not then their principal is not doing his or her job from all i have seen of the research the multiplechoice standardized tests that are now in common use will not reveal who those bad teachers are who knows the bad teachers might be extra good at drilling kids on test questions and we might end up giving bonuses to bad teachers when i spoke in missouri a couple of years ago i met hundreds of teachers after the event as i usually do so many told me that their father or mother had been a teacher before them i realized that these are the teachers we have now in the towns villages and cities of america and in the future we will have their sons and daughters in the classrooms we owe them a good start we owe them respect for the hard work they do for all of us we owe them good leadership we owe them the autonomy to make decisions in their classrooms rather than to be treated as automatons or robots and we owe it to them and their colleagues to treat teaching as a true profession not as a temp job meant for young college graduates who will be gone in two or three years diane may 8 2012 3 comments by rishawn biddle httpdropoutnationnet20120508dianeravitchandothereducationtraditionalistsdontknowwhatpubliceducationis one of the mostamazing aspects of the battle over the reform of american public education is that the lack of thoughtfulness among education traditionalists in their defense of failed policies and practices that have done little more than condemn 12 million children a year to poverty and prison this is especially true when it comes to how teaching and curricula should be provided to kids and whether the families that love them should be able to choose and shape the conditions in which their kids should learn from where they sit public education cant possibly include public charter schools publiclyfinanced school voucher programs or even online providers paid by states and chosen by families because these are operations that arent run by traditional districts with elected or mayorappointed school boards and executives this is why they constantly try to argue that charters – which are run by nonprofit and corporate entities — arent public schools even when they are clearly defined as such under state and federal law and why they argue that the very existence of charters is an affront to local control by school districts and it is why folks such as oncerespectable and now largelydiscredited educational historian diane ravitch constantly proclaim as she does today that moves such as louisiana gov bobby jindals successful effort to expand the states voucher program to serve as many as 300000 more students is dismantling public education reformers know this collective line of argument is one of the mosttiresome and infantile education traditionalists make and one that is the mostcircular this is because traditionalists base their notions not on facts or data but on mistaken interpretations of the very laws that govern public education in this country yet it is important to constantly point out this faulty antiintellectual thinking why because challenging the illogic posed in traditionalist arguments is key to advancing reform reformers must constantly point to education traditionalists that public education is ultimately a state government function all state constitutions charge state governments with the role of providing free public education in one form or another from deciding how education should be financed to how it should be delivered to children and families so states can shape public education in any way it wants so long as it is allowed in their respective constitutions if vouchers are allowed to be used as a means for providing public education in a respective state than the state can do it same if the state wants to allow for and finance public charter schools blended and virtual learning providers even homeschooling and diy education efforts by collections of families and communities it must also be pointed out that districts like other municipal governments within states are merely recognized as arms of state governments as defined under those constitutions as well as by the federal government through the no child left behind act the us supreme court said as much a century ago in the hunter v pittsburgh ruling this means that districts have no ability for independent action outside of what state governments decide if a state decides that it wants to allow nonprofit and forprofit organizations to provide education alongside districts this can be done and the district has no say in it it also means that districts have no ability to decide whether the financing for education provided by local taxpayers and the state can remain with them even if the children and families no longer use the district schools that once served them reformers need to remind traditionalists that their opposition to the expansion of vouchers and other forms of school choice is merely a legacy of the 19thcentury religious and ethnic bigotry of knownothings and unitarian protestants toward catholics all but some protestant denominations and even american indians the blaine laws that ban school vouchers and other public school dollars for educating kids in parochial settings for example were crafted specifically to force the children of irish catholic immigrants to become good americans who followed the unitarianinspired civic religion pushed earlier in the century by horace mann and his allies before that protestants fearful of the influx of irish catholics entering the nation and that they may attempt to put the nation under the control of the pope did all they could to effectively squelch catholicism in fact it was this bigotry that led to the mass formation of catholic diocesan schools that still remain the nations secondlargest collection of education providers and lets not forget the federal governments effort to kill the indian save the man through bureau of indian educationoperated boarding schools that forced kids off reservations and subjected them to educational physical and emotional abuse then there is the argument that privatesector involvement in education be it through companies or nonprofits is somehow evil this is a traditionalist argument reformers must also shut down because it is based on a senseless belief that somehow free enterprise and the operations involved in it are somehow evil while government is naturally good and virtuous anyone who has lived through watergate the irancontra scandal and even the recent financial meltdown knows that there is nothing true about it theres nothing inherently virtuous about governmentrun district schools or anything evil in utero about corporations providing schools the tax status of the organizations providing education dont matter more importantly in posing these arguments traditionalists fail to remember that companies and nonprofits are already critical players in how districts provide public education from publishing textbooks to providing accounting services whether or not those private operators always do a good job in those aspects or more importantly if districts do a good enough job of managing their contractors is a different discussion but the reality is that public education is quite dependent on the private sector in order to provide some of the mostcritical aspects of educating kids and especially dependent on companies for the taxes that fund their operations in the first place this fact should be pointed out ad nauseam and finally reformers must point out to traditionalists that public education is not about the kind of organization that provides instruction and curricula but how it is financed and regulated charter schools private schools online schools diy operations and even teachers working together or on their own are as capable to provide highquality education and even promote good citizenship as a traditional district based on the track record of late for traditional districts these days one can even say that the bureaucratic model is outdated and obsolete for this purpose what matters more is not whether the school operators are government or private but whether they provide our children with goodtogreat teachers strong comprehensive collegepreparatory curricula and cultures of genius that nurture the genius inherent in all kids those school operators that dont provide this or behave illegally and unethically be they traditional charter or private should be shut down and not get public funding while those that do the job deserve praise and support the warped antiintellectual thinking of education traditionalists deserves to be tossed into historys paper shredder and as reformers it is our job to battle faulty thinking from whoever poses it may 13 2012 704 pm over the past decade followers of the mysterious turkish cleric fethullah gulen have opened scores of charter schools in the us inspired by a man who is as powerful as he is reclusive lesley stahl reports cbs news fethullah gulen is the turkish islamic cleric at the center of a popular and growing movement with millions of disciples who follow his teachings of tolerance interfaith dialogue and education some have even started a chain of successful charter schools here in the us with an emphasis on math and science yet gulen himself remains shrouded in mystery lesley stahl travels from turkey to texas to report on how the movement is spreading and on the man behind it all the following script is from the gulen movement which aired on may 13 2012 lesley stahl is the correspondent shachar baron producer over the past decade scores of charter schools have popped up all over the us all sharing some common features most of them are highachieving academically they stress math and science and one more thing theyre founded and largely run by immigrants from turkey who are carrying out the teachings of a turkish islamic cleric fethullah gulen hes the spiritual leader of a growing and increasingly influential force in the muslim world known as the gulen movement with millions upon millions of disciples who compare him to ghandi and martin luther king gulen promotes tolerance interfaith dialog and aboveall he promotes education and yet hes a mystery man hes never seen or heard in public and the more power he gains the more questions are raised about his motives and the schools lesley stahl hi everyone students hi this is the harmony school in houston part of a rapidly expanding chain of 36 charter schools in texas they serve mostly underprivileged students and they all emphasize math and science student inside there is an elastic collision between the gas particles student what this is is a static electricity generator class work stresses handson experiments and competitiveness students made this hovercraft out of leafblowers for a science contest lesley stahl its great being a charter chain means these are public schools costing tax payers nearly 150 million a year lesley stahl so you dont even have a drivers license yet student but i have a robotics license julie norton is an administrator with the harmony chain of schools julie norton so we have about 20000 students lesley stahl is there a waiting list julie norton yes we have a waiting list we have approximately 30000 students on our waiting list we have more students on the waiting list than we have enrolled in the schools the education here gets high marks as students get stateoftheart technology and extensive oneonone tutoring lesley stahl do you get excited to come to school student yea i wake up like whooo the enthusiasm is hard to miss as is the fact that many of the teachers are turkish some just recently arrived and hard to understand lesley stahl when did you get here to the united states teacher unintelligible there are a total of about 130 charter schools like harmony in 26 states together they form the largest collection of charter schools in the country heres whats curious theyre founded and run by immigrant businessmen and academics from turkey why are they building public schools here well the answer seems to lie with this mystery man the turkish imam fethullah gulen who tells his followers that to be devout muslims they shouldnt build mosques they should build schools and not to teach religion but science in sermons on the web he actually says studying physics mathematics and chemistry is worshipping god so gulens followers have gone out and built over 1000 schools around the globe from turkey to togo from taiwan to texas alp aslandogan his message is that if you want to solve any social problem for the longer term the solution has to go through education businessman alp aslandogan chairs a foundation in houston that advances gulens teachings lesley stahl its so counterintuitive that people from turkey would come here to get involved here in education alp aslandogan people do go to other countries including africa the united states especially in math and science is not really good and many parents complain about that so there is a need for skilled teachers in the united states in that fields we went to turkey to learn more and found gulens schools are everywhere and considered the best theyre often multimillion dollar hitech facilities where girls are equal to boys and english is taught starting in first grade gulen didnt only influence education starting in the late 60s as a young imam he urged crowds of middle class turks to learn from the west and embrace its values including an unexpected one making money in this internet sermon he even told followers if you dont seek ways to be wealthythat is a sin in the eyes of god so his disciples in turkey became successful businessmen and built a multibillion dollar gulen empire that beyond the schools includes tv stations a major bank turkeys largest trade association and biggest newspaper andrew finkel they love capitalism it really is very much a business network as much as a religion in many ways andrew finkel whos been a freelance reporter in turkey for 25 years says gulen tells his followers to reach out to people of other faiths andrew finkel tolerance is a very key key part of their message and you know its not about the use of force lesley stahl its as far away from osama bin laden as you can get within the religion andrew finkel very very different yes lesley stahl so i guess one of the big questions is what kind of an islamic leader is gulen andrew finkel he leads by his own charismatic personality lesley stahl would you call it a personality cult andrew finkel yes to his followers gulens like a living prophet and he used his influence to change the course of turkeys politics helping to make it a functioning moderate islamic democracy one thing we couldnt find in turkey was gulen actually very few people ever see him in person he preaches via webcasts from a prayer room in an isolated and unlikely location for over a decade gulen has been living in selfimposed exile and seclusion in of all places the poconos in this gated pennsylvania retreat lesley stahl so does mr gulen live in this building bekir aksoy yes in this building to our surprise bekir aksoy who heads the retreat invited us in even though gulen had turned us down for an interview lesley stahl so this is the prayer room oh is that mr gulens seat his chair bekir aksoy right whenever he comes out of his room he sits there and he speaks from there lesley stahl and thats where he lives behind the door bekir aksoy that is the door behind which mr gulen lives that is his private room gulen lives there alone hes never married the pile of medicine bottles are a reminder that at 70 plus hes diabetic with heart and kidney problems lesley stahl will he come out will we get to see him bekir aksoy ah for the last five six months hes very very ill really when he is ill he does not accept visitors when gulen came to the us in 1999 it was for medical treatment but then this video surfaced in which he seems to order his flock to surreptitiously take over key government positions in turkey in a stealth islamic coup accused of treason by the government at the time gulen decided to stay in the poconos even after he was cleared in 2008 in abstenia lesley stahl why is he still in america andrew finkel well i think if he were to come back then there would be such a brouhaha and it would i think he would be afraid of being seen as being too powerful too powerful because it seems his followers have taken over key positions in the turkish government and the police andrew finkel you know if he says jump people jump theres no doubt about that lesley stahl you know we have confronted real fear about this movement particularly when weve tried to get critics to give us an interview what are they afraid of andrew finkel theres a fear of reprisal i mean it is the case that two or three people whove written books highly critical of the gulen movement are now in jail seeming to have such power this wizard of oz recluse invites conspiracy theories that hes running turkey from the poconos and is bent on global muslim domination his movement does lack transparency its funding hierarchy and ambitions remain hidden leading our state department to wonder in cables between ankara and washington if gulen has an insidious political agenda and now some of the suspicion revolves around the us schools do they serve a function other than educating our kids one accusation involves immigration fraud that the schools are providing work visas for hundreds of gulen followers from turkey lesley stahl and that the whole idea is just to get turks to come into the united states and this is an easy avenue for them david dunn which is just categorically not true david dunn of the texas charter schools association says that because of a deficit of qualified americans the schools bring in math and science teachers from turkey as this list of visa applications indicates problem is lesley stahl weve seen that some of these visas for turkish teachers to come here are for english for them to teach english how does that make any sense david dunn im not aware of that i dont i cant i cant comment on that i dont know i have not looked intimately into the visas they bring in lesley stahl we have english teachers in this country david dunn english teachers are typically not part of the critical or the deficit mary addi our tax dollars are paying for them to come over here and take our jobs mary addi was fired as a teacher from a school in cleveland ohio part of a guleninspired chain of 27 charter schools in the midwest mary addi they want to give you the impression that theyre just hardworkin guys over here to try to educate our kids because american teachers are just too stupid lesley stahl as far as you know why is an islamic imam which gulen is interested in setting up schools in the united states mary addi because its a great moneymaking operation gulens followers can make money thru contracts to build and maintain the schools but addi has gone to law enforcement with charges that the schools also make money by bringing in foreign teachers in order to take a cut of their salaries she says she learned this after marrying a turkish teacher mary addi and thats when he told me that every pay period he would have to cash his check and give he had to give 40 percent of his check back because lesley stahl forty percent of his salary mary addi 40 percent in cash yes lesley stahl and youve turned documents over to various federal agencies that you say proves this on paper mary addi yes the schools dismiss addis claims calling her a disgruntled employee but federal authorities told us they take her seriously and are looking into allegations of immigration fraud and misuse of taxpayer money in various states and whether its somehow being funneled to the gulen movement then theres the internet where there are incendiary blogs accusing the schools of secretly promoting an islamic agenda lesley stahl you know there are various blogs that have accused these schools of being backdoor madrassas david dunn yes lesley stahl so do you think theres a little bit islamophobia involved david dunn i think theres clearly some antiislam bias involved in these blogs actually we looked into this and islam is not taught at all that would be illegal since these are public schools that go out of their way to distance themselves from any religious affiliation even denying a connection to the gulen movement david dunn i think what matters is the results in the classrooms are kids learning math science reading writing at a superior level and clearly in these schools thats happening it is happening newsweek voted two harmony schools among americas top 10 more of these schools open every year across the country and waiting lists just keep getting longer gulenists tell us the schools are about reading writing and arithmetic not religion and bekir aksoy in the poconos says the man behind the door has no hidden agenda fethullah gulen hasnt even visited any of the schools bekir aksoy he does not want to see the fruits of his work he just speaks and encourages people to be good human beings lesley stahl thats interesting because there are schools in pennsylvania i mean not that far bekir aksoy he has not seen any of them believe me he does not leave that room",

            "text": "Fr si1) I recently read the book Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10 (www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316044695/tilsoncapitalpar) and also attended a dinner with a member of Seal Team 6. I am in awe of these brave men and the sacrifices they make for our country. I am also in awe of how they are trained, motivated, managed and led, which raises the question: Is Seal Team 6 as great as it is primarily because of the superstar individuals that comprise it, or does the greatness lie mainly in the whole: the structure, training, leadership, etc.?\n\nThe reason I'm thinking about this is because for the 22% of the children in this country who live in poverty (and, in many cases, also suffer from poor diet/health, few books in the house, a single, poorly educated parent who may not even speak English, etc.), to have any chance in life, they don't need average schools, or even good schools – they need the educational equivalent of Seal Team 6.\n\nThat may seem like an impossibly high bar, but it's not: I've personally visited dozens of schools – part of the KIPP, Uncommon, AF, Success, Uplift, YES Prep, etc. networks – that are the educational equivalents of Seal Team 6. Obviously we should be trying to replicate these schools as quickly as possible (obvious to any unconflicted person with a brain and a heart anyway – I realize that excludes large numbers of people), so one key question is: should we be focusing our efforts on superstar teachers (classroom level) or at the school level? For years, I thought the former, focusing on teachers like Jaime Escalante, Rafe Esquith, and Harriett Ball, but now I think the latter, for four primary reasons:\n\nA) There aren't enough superstar teachers and we'll never be able to find/train enough;\n\nB) A superstar teacher can move a kid a long way in a year, but rarely is a child's overall life trajectory changed by one year with even the greatest teacher;\n\nC) Superstar teachers burn out at a high rate; and\n\nD) As Neerav Kingsland (who is one of the panelists after the showing of The Experiment on Monday) points out, the same person can be a dud in one school environment and a superstar in another:\n\nLet's take two lawyers – Top-Third Tina (went to Harvard Law) and Bottom-Third Barry (went to lower tier law school) both pass the bar exam. Due to magical forces, they do not get to choose where they work (sound familiar?). Interestingly enough, they are assigned to the same law firm. It happens to be a mediocre firm and here's what happens:\n\n·         Neither Tina nor Barry gets trained. Since law school doesn't really teach you anything about day-to-day practice of law, both struggle. Tina works harder, attempts to train herself, and starts improving – but at the end of the day her efforts are marginal. She outperforms Barry but not by much. Neither really knows how to practice law. At the end of their second year, each gets a \"below average\" on the state's law practitioner value-added system.\n\nNow let's re-run the scenario. This time, Tina and Barry both get placed at an excellent law firm. Here's what happens:\n\n·         Both Tina and Barry get superb on-the-job training. They each attend intensive summer training and for their first year they are assigned to a top-notch lawyer for mentorship. They are consistently coached, given feedback, and evaluated. Their second year, each is allowed to handle cases on their own. By the end of her second year, Tina is on the partner track. She's impressed everyone. Barry struggles with the high expectations, but learns a lot and improves. At the end of their second year, each gets their value-added score. Tina scores an \"above average\" and Barry scores \"average.\"\n\nNow let's apply this to education – here's what we might see:\n\n·         In average to poorly managed schools, the impact of the institution itself will drown out a lot of potential variance in effectiveness. Nobody gets trained or supported. Few people excel.\n\n·         However, in a well-run school, two things will happen: (1) all teachers will improve and (2) the \"talented\" teachers will show a significant effect that was not picked up in the poorly run school.\n\nThis is my theory, at least. Why? Well, it seems logical. Institutions matter.\n\n2) Re. the charter schools contribute to segregation nonsense I addressed in my last email, here's more from the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools:\n\nCharter opponents sometimes conduct studies asking whether the racial and economic composition of charter schools is perfectly reflective of the sending traditional school district (see Miron et. al., February 2010). The unsurprising result is, no, most charters do not look exactly like the nearby school districts and the authors then draw conclusions suggesting problematic racial segregation in charters. The obvious flaw here, however, is the comparison between a charter school and a traditional district; if we want to criticize charters for not being perfectly reflective of a broader area, we should also ask the same question of traditional schools.  That is, how well do the traditional school campuses reflect the broader district's racial composition? When we ask this question, we generally find that neither charters nor traditional schools are reflective of the broader district or community.\n\nA report with data from many large cities comparing charter school populations to the rest of the school system is  at: http://www.publiccharters.org/data/files/Publication_docs/Geographic%20Location%20Details%20from%20the%20Dashboard%20Report_20120224T143955.pdf\n\n3) Great news from an ed reformer friend in Dallas:\n\nI wanted to share with you very meaningful progress and strategies going on in Dallas, TX, the 14th largest school district in the country with 160,000 students (95% non-Anglo, 87% socio-economic disadvantaged). Due to the work of a dedicated group of reformers, the following key strategic initiatives have been accomplished in just the last 12 months: (i) created Leadership DISD, an non-profit organization formed to train/educate 50-100 passionate citizens annually regarding what they need to know to play a leadership in our school district and serving as a great pipeline to identify new school board trustees; (ii) EducateDallas\n\n, a PAC originated by the local business chamber to raise money to support reformist candidates; and (iii)  , a grassroots PAC with 500+ members (parents, teachers, etc.) and growing fast that is focused on electioneering/canvassing/get out the vote efforts. Together, these efforts have created a robust pipeline of identified future trustees and in this cycle raised five times the amount of money historically raised for a school board election and almost doubled the turnout in the three board elections that occurred this last Saturday, with the PAC-endorsed reformist candidate winning EVERY election.\n\nWe now have a solid reformist board which will build upon the recent policy successes enacted in just the last year including (i) performance over seniority in all reassignment/termination decisions; (ii) elimination of the forced placement of ineffective teachers on unwilling principals; (iii) authorization of a new teacher evaluation system meaningfully incorporating student outcomes and (iv) execution of a five-year contract with Teach for America, reportedly the longest contract that TFA has ever signed with an urban school district in its history.  On top of those efforts, we recently hired Mike Miles from Colorado Springs as our new superintendent, a former West Point/Army Ranger and Broad Fellow who announced in the last week a very student-focused mission focused on substantially improving teacher and leadership quality.  He has announced that he will be conducting a national search to hire a new chief of schools, a new chief academic officer and 50 new principal candidates who will be trained to assume school leadership in the Fall of 2013 (see link to opportunities below).\n\nFinally, in the last year we formed (i)  , a backbone infrastructure organization (similar to the Strive effort within Cincinnati) serving all of Dallas County (2.5 million people and 800,000 children ages 0-22) and focused on scaling best practices across the region and helping coordinate state and local funding towards those efforts proven by data to be most effective and (ii) the  , an urban school leadership masters program housed on the campus of SMU and founded in part by the founder of  , the region's largest public school network. Uplift now has 25 schools that will stabilize at over 13,000 students and has 10,000+ students on its wait list; in addition, the local KIPP network will be adding two more schools in Fall 2013. With a new mayor (Mike Rawlings) elected in June, 2011 on a platform to raise up and strongly support our public schools (and the knowledge that change is made easier with Texas being a right-to-work state), all of us are excited about the accelerated progress and prospects for our children and want people nationally to know about the significant leadership opportunities available within our public school systems today.\n\nThe city Department of Education hopes to ease long-existing tensions between district and charter schools with a new collaboration set to kick off in the Bronx.\n\nThe District-Charter Compact is made up of public district schools and 85 charter schools across the city, and will start with a \"Bronx Study Tour Program\" for educators to share their best practices.\n\n\"I think, up until now, charters and districts haven't had a lot of communication,\" said , principal of one of the participating schools, the Urban Assembly School for Applied Math and Science. \"It's a wonderful opportunity to get people talking and share things we do well.\"\n\nThe initiative, launched with financial support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, will officially start in June with panels and meetings. Other model Bronx schools that have put out the welcome mat include Eagle Academy for Young Men, KIPP Academy Middle School and Bronx Charter School for Excellence. In each school, educators can observe classes, participate in professional development sessions and discuss common techniques.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to really begin sharing ideas, regardless of what our models are,\" said , head of the Bronx Charter School for Excellence. \"We all have the same goals. We're all NYC educators. We're excited to open up our doors for all educators who want to inquire and begin to work together, because these are all the same students in the Bronx and we want to deliver for them.\"\n\nParent activist , who has a daughter at Equality Charter School in the Bronx, said she hopes participants include the ones who need this initiative most - struggling schools and schools on the chopping block.\n\n\"They need to go and partner with the schools already on the hit list, and the schools that have received consecutive Cs, Ds and Fs, and give them the support that they need,\" said Davids, president of NYC Parents Union. \"Since charters are supposed to be labs for innovation, I think they should be partnering with failing district schools.\"\n\n5) The WSJ's Lisa Fleisher with more on the strong steps Bloomberg and Walcott are taking (with a great quote at the end about terrible teachers):\n\nAfter years of trying to oust ineffective teachers by reforming the system, the Bloomberg administration is turning to options it already has available to try to prune the weakest educators from its ranks.\n\nSchools Chancellor Dennis Walcott said Thursday the district would move to fire teachers who receive low ratings due to incompetence in two consecutive years if a new teacher-evaluation system isn't in place by the time school starts this fall.\n\nHe also proposed offering buyouts to teachers who have been floating in the system for more than a year without permanent classroom positions. The value of the buyouts would have to be negotiated with the teachers union.\n\nRidding schools of poorly performing teachers has been one of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's highest priorities, but his attempts to make sweeping institutional changes haven't always succeeded against union resistance. He lost a fight last year to end seniority protections during layoffs, and efforts to fire teachers for incompetence have been slow.\n\n…Joanne Pezzolo, a high-school English teacher from Staten Island, said she would jump at the chance to take a buyout. But at age 53, she said she can't afford one unless it's about half her $79,000 annual salary. Ms. Pezzolo, who was cut from a school that had declining enrollment, said she sees both sides of the argument. She hated traveling among schools and believed there was a stigma attached to teachers in the ATR pool.\n\nBut when she found a longer-term spot at a school in Brooklyn's Cobble Hill, she said she saw some atrocious teachers. One man came in, put his coat over his head, dragged a few chairs together and went to sleep, she recalled. Other teachers refused to leave their drivers' licenses at the front desk in exchange for a bathroom key.\n\n\"They shouldn't get a buyout,\" she said. \"They shouldn't even get a paycheck. They should just be fired.\"\n\nI thought and thought but I couldn't remember a single teacher in my own experience, or that of my children or grandchildren, who was a drunk-on-the-job teacher. I went to ordinary public schools in Houston, and I had my share of ordinary teachers. I remember someone told me once that if you have even one great teacher in your lifetime, you are blessed. I was doubly blessed, as I had at least two.\n\nBut I must say, I never came across any of the horrible men or women who seem to give the reformers sleepless nights.\n\nIf they exist, and I suppose they must, then they should be fired in their first year on the job. If not, then their principal is not doing his or her job.\n\nNote how she talks about how she went to \"ordinary public schools in Houston\" (in an era long before unions made it impossible to get rid of terrible teachers\" and then mentions her own children, leaving the reader with the clear impression that they, too, went to public schools. NOT! This is typical Ravitch disingenuousness, which is much more common that outright lies (though she tells plenty of those too). In fact, Ravitch sent her children to the private, super elite, super expensive (tuition this year is $38,710; see: ) Dalton School on the Upper East Side, smack in the middle of the wealthiest Census tract in the U.S.:\n\nDiane Ravitch Sent Her Sons To Private School. According to the Washington Post, \"Assistant Secretary Diane S. Ravitch, who lived in New York City before moving to Washington last year, sent her now-grown sons to private schools.\" [Washington Post, ]\n\nNote: This was reprinted in The Houston Chronicle\n\nRavitch's Two Sons Went To Dalton, A \"Selective Manhattan Prep School\". According to a New York Times article titled \"SCHOOL CHOICE; Where They Send Their Own\", \"DIANE RAVITCH. Research professor of education at New York University. Where: Two sons -- an investment banker and a writer -- went to the selective Manhattan prep school Dalton. Why: In the mid- and late 60's, \"public schools in the city were wracked with political and racial strife,\" Dr. Ravitch says. She has never regretted choosing Dalton. \"Both studied classical languages -- Greek and Latin -- lots of history, Shakespeare, science and mathematics. They were extremely well prepared for college.\" [New York Times, ]\n\nRavitch \"Wishes All Children Had The Education Hers Received At A Progressive Private School\". According to a review of one of Ravitch's books in Radical Teacher, \"Ravitch does say she wishes all children had the education hers received at a progressive private school in New York City, Dalton, with its curriculum history and literature, and with great teachers who made ideas come alive.\" [Radical Teacher, 3/22/04]\n\nAn Article About Diane Ravitch's Ex-Husband Mentions That Their Two Sons Went The Private Dalton School. According to the New York Times, \"Most distressing of all, state and city school officials say, is that Mr. Ravitch's hands-on experience in elementary and secondary education is almost nonexistent, limited to a brief stint as chairman of the board of the Dalton School, the elite private academy on the Upper East Side that his two sons attended in the 1970's.\" [New York Times, ]\n\nTo be clear, I live in that very Census tract and send my three daughters to a similarly elite, expensive private school – but there's one difference: I DON'T TRY TO HIDE THIS FACT! Union hacks have tried to make hay of this, but my answer is simple: \"I've seen the difference a high-quality education has made in my life and the lives of my children, so all I'm fighting for is for EVERY child to have the same opportunity!\"\n\n7) RiShawn Biddle takes on Ravitch and other education traditionalists:\n\nOne of the most-amazing aspects of the battle over the reform of American public education is that the lack of thoughtfulness among education traditionalists in their defense of failed policies and practices that have done little more than condemn 1.2 million children a year to poverty and prison. This is especially true when it comes to how teaching and curricula should be provided to kids, and whether the families that love them should be able to choose and shape the conditions in which their kids should learn. From where they sit, public education can't possibly include public charter schools, publicly-financed school voucher programs, or even online providers paid by states (and chosen by families) because these are operations that aren't run by traditional districts with elected (or mayor-appointed) school boards and executives. This is why they constantly try to argue that charters  – which are run by nonprofit and corporate entities — aren't \"public schools\", even when they are clearly defined as such under state and federal law, and why they argue that the very existence of charters is an affront to \"local control\" by school districts. And it is why folks such as once-respectable (and now largely-discredited) educational historian Diane Ravitch constantly  as she does today that moves such as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's successful effort to expand the state's voucher program to serve as many as 300,000 more students is \"dismantling public education\".\n\nReformers know this collective line of argument is one of the most-tiresome (and infantile) education traditionalists make, and one that is the most-circular. This is because traditionalists base their notions not on facts or data, but on mistaken interpretations of the very laws that govern public education in this country. Yet it is important to constantly point out this faulty anti-intellectual thinking. Why? Because challenging the illogic posed in traditionalist arguments is key to advancing reform.\n\n8) Case study 5,347,341 of the unions defending ANY teacher, no matter how bad (from EAG):\n\nThe strange case of Kurt Kostelecky has cost taxpayers at least $64,000\n\nWAUSAUKEE, Wis. - To more fully understand the destructive influence Big Labor has on public schools, consider the case of a former Wisconsin teacher, Kurt Kostelecky.\n\nKostelecky was convicted last summer for having sexual contact with a freshman female student during the 2008-09 school year, and is currently serving a 10-year prison term. (He claims the student came on to him, and he \" .\")\n\n      But that doesn't mean Kostelecky's former employer, the Wausaukee school district, can wash its hands of him. The convicted child molester was a member of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, which is still waging a legal fight on his behalf.\n\n      WEAC is suing the district over allegations it improperly reduced Kostelecky's teaching load as retribution because he \"challenged district policies\" back in 2009, Fox11online.com.\n\n      An Internet search indicates that Kostelecky taught shop class for the district, and had his teaching load reduced from five-eighths of a full-time teaching position to three-eighths in 2009. The district was facing a budget deficit, and claims the reduction in hours was an effort to save money. The union says it was an effort to convince a trouble-making teacher to resign, the news outlet reports.  \n\n      The fact that Kostelecky is now a convicted child molester, and was only a part-time teacher who should've thought twice about shooting his mouth off, hasn't stopped the union from continuing its lawsuit, which has dragged on for three years and cost taxpayers at least $64,000.\n\n      Not only is the union wasting taxpayers' money – probably enough to pay the salary and benefits of a beginning teacher – it's also frittering away WEAC members' dues dollars on a pointless lawsuit. \n\n      The Kostelecky case is a perfect example of how teacher unions cause dissension within a community and waste school dollars on issues that don't benefit children in the least. \n\n      WEAC has been on quite a losing streak lately, as Kathleen Falk's defeat in last week's recall primary election demonstrates. By lawyering up on behalf of a convicted child molester, it seems the union wants to prove that it's still relevant. \n\n      Regardless, Wausaukee taxpayers can't be too impressed with the union's wasteful behavior, and we suspect rank-and-file WEAC members aren't impressed, either.\n\n9) 60 Minutes did a segment on a network of charter schools run by a Turkish imam, trying to make it seem like there was something nefarious going on, but I checked with some friends and learned that these are excellent schools, so this smacks of xenophobia to me. The video is at: www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7408418n and the transcript is below:\n\n(CBS News) Fethullah Gulen is the Turkish Islamic cleric at the center of a popular and growing movement, with millions of disciples who follow his teachings of tolerance, interfaith dialogue, and education. Some have even started a chain of successful charter schools here in the U.S., with an emphasis on math and science. Yet Gulen himself remains shrouded in mystery. Lesley Stahl travels from Turkey to Texas to report on how the movement is spreading, and on the man behind it all.\n\nThe following script is from \"The Gulen Movement\" which aired on May 13, 2012. Lesley Stahl is the correspondent. Shachar Bar-On, producer.\n\nOver the past decade scores of charter schools have popped up all over the U.S., all sharing some common features. Most of them are high-achieving academically, they stress math and science, and one more thing: they're founded and largely run by immigrants from Turkey who are carrying out the teachings of a Turkish Islamic cleric: Fethullah Gulen.\n\nHe's the spiritual leader of a growing and increasingly influential force in the Muslim world -- known as \"The Gulen Movement\" -- with millions upon millions of disciples who compare him to Ghandi and Martin Luther King. Gulen promotes tolerance, interfaith dialog, and above-all: he promotes education. And yet he's a mystery man -- he's never seen or heard in public -- and the more power he gains, the more questions are raised about his motives and the schools.\n\n10) Harlem Village Academies got Hugh Jackman to tape a funny teacher recruiting video for them: (2:48)\n\nThere's been some good blogging lately on how to interpret the studies on Teach For America (TFA) teacher effectiveness – see and . But neither addresses the research from a standpoint. Here's what they say:\n\nMatt's takeaway: TFA teachers are by most standards \"talented\" – i.e., they went to selective universities, graduated at the top of their class, are motivated, and work hard. But they don't dramatically outperform traditional teachers. So perhaps that link between recruiting \"talented\" teachers and increasing test scores isn't as tight as it might seem.\n\nAdam's takeaway: TFA teachers get five weeks of training and achieve roughly the same results as teachers who go through much longer university-based training programs. So imagine what \"talented\" TFA-type folks could do if they actually had more training.\n\nBoth interesting points, and well worth thinking more about. And newer coming out may show even stronger TFA effects. But there seems to be a limit to what we can extrapolate from these studies, as the TFA studies only tell us how well TFA teachers compare to other teachers when everyone is teaching in generally mediocre schools that operate in a government monopoly. In the studies, the system is a given.\n\nNow, if you're a Relinquisher who believes government should regulate but not operate schools, immediate questions arise – primary amongst them: Do these studies tell us anything about how different teachers achieve in different environments? Not really.\n\nLet's take two lawyers – Top-Third Tina (went to Harvard Law) and Bottom-Third Barry (went to lower tier law school) both pass the bar exam. Due to magical forces, they do not get to choose where they work ( ?). Interestingly enough, they are assigned to the same law firm. It happens to be a mediocre firm and here's what happens:\n\nNow let's re-run the scenario. This time, Tina and Barry both get placed at an excellent law firm. Here's what happens:\n\nNow let's apply this to education – here's what we might see:\n\nThis is my theory, at least. Why? Well, it seems logical. Institutions matter. Also, many high-performing charter schools recruit heavily from TFA, which leads me to believe that in high-performing environments TFA teachers add a lot of value, especially when they are trained correctly and given increasing responsibility as they develop – and, of course, they are most likely cost effective as well.\n\nThe takeaway: in some schools, Top-Third Tina and Bottom-Third Barry will perform roughly the same after two years. In others they will not.\n\nThat's my hunch at least. But, unfortunately, we have no idea if this is true because the TFA studies only measure how well TFA teachers perform in mediocre schools.\n\nSo, here's me bowing out of the TFA research debate. Until someone does further research, that is.\n\nNeerav Kingsland is Chief Strategy Officer of New Schools for New Orleans .\n\nEarlier this week, on public charter schools meeting the diverse demands of their communities. This question of diversity (particularly, racial and socioeconomic diversity) is important to all public schools, including public charter schools.  Groups such as UCLA's pay close attention to racial segregation in all public schools and , for example, that \"the children in United States schools are much poorer than they were decades ago and more separated in highly unequal schools.\"\n\nUnfortunately, many charter school opponents have seized this very real issue and misused it as an opportunity to bash charter schools. Just do a simple Google search on \"segregation and charter schools\" and you will find numerous hits in which news outlets or websites uncritically repeat the allegations of fervent charter bashers.\n\nThese claims reappear every so often and the problems are many. Let me name a few.\n\n1.  . \"Analyses\" that take this shotgun approach present tables upon tables of data aiming to show (somehow) that charter schools are simultaneously schools of white flight that \"cream\" only the best students miserable places in which poor children are trapped each day. Each of these conflicting claims is then backed up with an isolated example or two of a heavily white or heavily minority charter school. Of course, such reports make no mention of the numerous heavily white or heavily minority traditional schools surrounding the charter schools in question.\n\n2.  . Some reports make almost no attempt to gather data. These reports often include phrases like, \"charter schools are the most segregated in the district.\" For example, the points to a and claims that \"Some of the nation's most segregated schools are charter schools, where students are often isolated by race, income, language and special education status\". While this blanket claim may be true (depending upon how segregation is defined), it is also true that the other segregated schools, indeed most of the segregated schools, are traditional schools. This is often the case in districts that are heavily segregated by neighborhoods where the traditional schools are also segregated.  \n\n \n\n 3.  . Charter opponents sometimes conduct studies asking whether the racial and economic composition of charter schools is perfectly reflective of the sending traditional school district (see ). The unsurprising result is, no, most charters do not look exactly like the nearby school districts and the authors then draw conclusions suggesting problematic racial segregation in charters. The obvious flaw here, however, is the comparison between a charter and a traditional ; if we want to criticize charters for not being perfectly reflective of a broader area, we should also ask the same question of traditional schools.  That is, how well do the traditional school campuses reflect the broader district's racial composition? When we ask this question, we generally find that neither charters nor traditional schools are reflective of the broader district or community. Check out the graph below showing data for a large southern district; the Y-axis represents the number of schools within the bands represented on the X-axis. For example, two of the schools in the district had minority student percentages between 20.0 percent and 24.9 percent while 13 schools had minority student percentages between 95 percent and 100 percent and so on. The take-away point here is that most of the traditional public schools do not reflect the overall district.  In a district with 78 percent minority students, half of the schools are heavily minority schools (90 percent or more minority students) and one-quarter of the schools are disproportionately white.\n\n\n\n  \n\n [green bars show the only diverse schools in the district]\n\nConsequently, the relevant question is not whether charter schools reflect the broader district; the question is whether charter schools are more or less reflective of the district than the traditional public schools in the broader community.\n\n4.  Studies at the state or national level . A perfect example of this type of analysis is a February 2010 study by the aforementioned Civil Rights Project (CRP) titled \" Choice without Equity: Charter School Segregation and the Need for Civil Rights Standards .\" The key flaw in this oft-referenced study is that the CRP authors focus on the fraction of students in highly segregated minority schools, and compare the figure for charter schools to that of traditional public schools. This is clearly an inappropriate analytic strategy because the geographic placement of public charter schools practically ensures that they will enroll higher percentages of minorities than will the average traditional school. As we show in our (with the data attached so that anyone can choose to review or re-analyze it), our more appropriate analytic strategy clearly demonstrates how the CRP authors overstated their findings.\n\nThese are simply examples of the numerous ways to unfairly attack charter schools based on the demographic characteristics of the students that they serve. There are many others; indeed, some reports use no data at all but simply make reference to other flawed studies and yet the conclusions drawn by these reports are treated as new by those eager to bash charter schools. See, for example, the recent report called that was used by charter critics to \"show\" that segregation is fostered by public charter schools.\n\nWe have worked on this a great deal and have tried to figure out the best way to assess the relative racial integration and segregation at charter schools. It is complicated and requires that the researchers make several decisions (which can be debated) about how to define integration or segregation. Nevertheless, in recent years, some studies have done a good job of attacking this question. See, for example, the thorough analysis by the . Good studies such as this generally compare the relative integration or the racial compositions of charter schools to that of traditional public schools.\n\nThoughtful analyses find that students who move into charter schools mostly choose schools with racial compositions similar to those of the traditional public schools they exited. These results are not uniform; they vary state by state (for example, we find in Florida that charter schools and traditional public schools are similar in their \"reflectiveness\" of the broader community; in Delaware, however, charters are not as reflective of the community as are traditional public schools.) Results also vary by metropolitan area (in Philadelphia, 65 percent of the students in both charters and traditional schools attend highly segregated schools; in Atlanta, only 25 percent of charter students attend highly segregated schools while 70 percent of traditional public schools students attend such segregated schools).\n\nOf course, schools (charters or traditional) that are the most \"segregated\" sit in geographic areas with high concentrations of poor and minority students. These families have the fewest choices; when they are dissatisfied with the schooling options they have, charters often open to serve these disadvantaged students. These are issues related to poverty and residential segregation — these are not charter problems!\n\nIn short, the claims that charter schools enhance segregation across the board are most certainly false and more than likely a thinly-veiled attempt of charter opponents to slow the charter movement and limit choices options. And, to cast these attacks as a defense of racial integration is simply disingenuous. For example, the majority of students in center cities, in both the public charter sector and in the traditional public sector, attend intensely segregated minority schools. We know this, any casual observer of urban schools knows this, and the critics of charter schools know this.\n\nThus, anyone truly interested in racial integration for students (and not simply interested in attacking charter schools) is looking in the wrong direction by focusing on the failings of charter schools. Charters serve fewer than three percent of US public school children; the remaining 97 percent are compelled to attend traditional public schools. Anyone genuinely concerned with enhancing racial integration should be channeling their energy toward reducing segregation in the traditional sector.\n\nFinally, when critics use the term segregation to malign charter schools, it might be viewed as disrespectful to those who have suffered from formalized segregation in the past or to those who currently suffer from residential segregation. It does not seem to be the right term to use when referring to the results of active choices made by families of minority students. Segregation connotes a lack of freedom; this situation feels like the opposite. The fact that some poor students are free to flee segregated traditional public schools for similarly segregated charters be viewed as an indictment of charters. Indeed, leaders of charter organizations are quick to state that they are honored to serve minority families who the charter schools after a search for attractive schooling options. It is simply wrong to compare these active parental choices to the forced segregation of our nation's past. \n\n \n\n Gary W. Ritter, Professor of Education and Public Policy, University of Arkansas\n\nAfter years of trying to oust ineffective teachers by reforming the system, the Bloomberg administration is turning to options it already has available to try to prune the weakest educators from its ranks.\n\nSchools Chancellor Dennis Walcott said Thursday the district would move to fire teachers who receive low ratings due to incompetence in two consecutive years if a new teacher-evaluation system isn't in place by the time school starts this fall.\n\nHe also proposed offering buyouts to teachers who have been floating in the system for more than a year without permanent classroom positions. The value of the buyouts would have to be negotiated with the teachers union.\n\nRidding schools of poorly performing teachers has been one of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's highest priorities, but his attempts to make sweeping institutional changes haven't always succeeded against union resistance. He lost a fight last year to end seniority protections during layoffs, and efforts to fire teachers for incompetence have been slow.\n\nThe buyouts are intended to put a dent in a group of about 830 teachers who have been unable to find jobs in the city's public schools but have tenure protection. About 475 currently would be eligible for a buyout, and most of the group would be eligible by autumn.\n\nSome teachers in the so-called Absent Teacher Reserve pool were let go by their principals, while others were in schools that were closed by the city. A few were previously in the infamous \"rubber rooms,\" where teachers facing disciplinary procedures did little work while collecting paychecks.\n\n\"Every dollar we save, we can use to benefit our students instead of wasting it on teachers who probably chose the wrong profession,\" Mr. Walcott said during an address at the Sheraton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe average salary for teachers in the pool is $82,420, but the city saved about $5 million this year by using them as substitutes throughout the system.\n\nSimilar buyouts have been used in Washington, D.C., Dallas and Houston, with offers of, for instance, $20,000 for the most senior teachers. Mr. Walcott said New York's would be \"more attractive than any we've seen across the nation—for teachers, and for the taxpayers of New York City.\"\n\nHe didn't, however, provide an estimated cost of the proposal. In his speech, Mr. Walcott said the city was spending $100 million on the salaries for teachers in the pool, but his office later said the figure was $68.5 million for salaries, a number that jumped to $93 million when benefits costs were included.\n\nMichael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said the union has approached both Mr. Walcott and his predecessor to propose buyouts but were brushed back. He called the plan a \"nice change of heart.\"\n\n\"It would have been easier if [Mr. Walcott] called me first,\" he said. \"He might have been able to do a speech about how it's already done and negotiated.\"\n\nHe questioned why Mr. Bloomberg has waited so long to try to fire teachers with two straight years of an \"unsatisfactory\" rating, a power the administration has always had but left up to principals' discretion. Of the roughly 75,000 city teachers, 235 have been rated \"unsatisfactory\" for incompetence for two consecutive years.\n\nLike districts throughout New York state, the city has been negotiating with its teachers' union over a new evaluation system that makes it easier to fire teachers. Under state law, the city must have a new, four-tiered job-performance review in place by January or lose a small amount of state funding.\n\nThe Absent Teacher Reserve pool was established in the 2005 teachers' contract, when forced job-placement within the school system ended. Both teachers and principals had to accept each other, or teachers would be on the payroll without a permanent position, often serving as long-term substitutes.\n\nThis year, teachers without permanent positions have been assigned to schools as substitutes for a week at a time. After the week is up, they rotate to another school.\n\nThe Department of Education said this was intended as a sort of speed-dating: introduce as many teachers and principals as possible, and hope they find a match. But critics called the procedure a hardship intended to push out teachers by forcing them to commute to different locations across the city.\n\nJoanne Pezzolo, a high-school English teacher from Staten Island, said she would jump at the chance to take a buyout. But at age 53, she said she can't afford one unless it's about half her $79,000 annual salary. Ms. Pezzolo, who was cut from a school that had declining enrollment, said she sees both sides of the argument. She hated traveling among schools and believed there was a stigma attached to teachers in the ATR pool.\n\nBut when she found a longer-term spot at a school in Brooklyn's Cobble Hill, she said she saw some atrocious teachers. One man came in, put his coat over his head, dragged a few chairs together and went to sleep, she recalled. Other teachers refused to leave their drivers' licenses at the front desk in exchange for a bathroom key.\n\n\"They shouldn't get a buyout,\" she said. \"They shouldn't even get a paycheck. They should just be fired.\"\n\nMarc Tucker has an interesting blog today in Education Week ( ) about teachers. He recounts his many encounters with incompetent, drunk-on-the-job teachers. But he uses this beginning to say that we really need to give more thought to helping teachers, encouraging the best teachers, and improving the conditions of teachers so as to attract excellent candidates in the future.\n\nI thought and thought but I couldn't remember a single teacher in my own experience, or that of my children or grandchildren, who was a drunk-on-the-job teacher. I went to ordinary public schools in Houston, and I had my share of ordinary teachers. I remember someone told me once that if you have even one great teacher in your lifetime, you are blessed. I was doubly blessed, as I had at least two.\n\nBut I must say, I never came across any of the horrible men or women who seem to give the reformers sleepless nights.\n\nIf they exist, and I suppose they must, then they should be fired in their first year on the job. If not, then their principal is not doing his or her job.\n\nFrom all I have seen of the research, the multiple-choice standardized tests that are now in common use will not reveal who those \"bad\" teachers are. Who knows, the \"bad\" teachers might be extra good at drilling kids on test questions. And we might end up giving bonuses to \"bad\" teachers.\n\nWhen I spoke in Missouri a couple of years ago, I met hundreds of teachers after the event, as I usually do. So many told me that their father or mother had been a teacher before them. I realized that these are the teachers we have now, in the towns, villages, and cities of America. And in the future we will have their sons and daughters in the classrooms. We owe them a good start. We owe them respect for the hard work they do for all of us. We owe them good leadership. We owe them the autonomy to make decisions in their classrooms, rather than to be treated as automatons or robots. And we owe it to them and their colleagues to treat teaching as a true profession, not as a temp job meant for young college graduates who will be gone in two or three years.\n\nOne of the most-amazing aspects of the battle over the reform of American public education is that the lack of thoughtfulness among education traditionalists in their defense of failed policies and practices that have done little more than condemn 1.2 million children a year to poverty and prison. This is especially true when it comes to how teaching and curricula should be provided to kids, and whether the families that love them should be able to choose and shape the conditions in which their kids should learn. From where they sit, public education can't possibly include public charter schools, publicly-financed school voucher programs, or even online providers paid by states (and chosen by families) because these are operations that aren't run by traditional districts with elected (or mayor-appointed) school boards and executives. This is why they constantly try to argue that charters  – which are run by nonprofit and corporate entities — aren't \"public schools\", even when they are clearly defined as such under state and federal law, and why they argue that the very existence of charters is an affront to \"local control\" by school districts. And it is why folks such as once-respectable (and now largely-discredited) educational historian Diane Ravitch constantly  as she does today that moves such as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's successful effort to expand the state's voucher program to serve as many as 300,000 more students is \"dismantling public education\".\n\nReformers know this collective line of argument is one of the most-tiresome (and infantile) education traditionalists make, and one that is the most-circular. This is because traditionalists base their notions not on facts or data, but on mistaken interpretations of the very laws that govern public education in this country. Yet it is important to constantly point out this faulty anti-intellectual thinking. Why? Because challenging the illogic posed in traditionalist arguments is key to advancing reform.\n\nReformers must constantly point to education traditionalists that  public education is ultimately a state government function. All state constitutions charge state governments with the role of providing \"free public education\" in one form or another, from deciding how education should be financed to how it should be delivered to children and families. So states can shape public education in any way it wants so long as it is allowed in their respective constitutions; if vouchers are allowed to be used as a means for providing public education in a respective state, than the state can do it; same if the state wants to allow for (and finance) public charter schools, blended and virtual learning providers, even homeschooling and DIY education efforts by collections of families and communities.\n\nIt must also be pointed out that districts, like other municipal governments within states, are merely recognized as arms of state governments as defined under those constitutions (as well as by the federal government through the No Child Left Behind Act). The U.S. Supreme Court said as much a century ago in the   ruling. This means that districts have no ability for independent action outside of what state governments decide. If a state decides that it wants to allow nonprofit and for-profit organizations to provide education alongside districts, this can be done and the district has no say in it. It also means that districts have no ability to decide whether the financing for education provided by local taxpayers and the state can remain with them even if the children and families no longer use the district schools that once served them.\n\nReformers need to remind traditionalists that their  opposition to the expansion of vouchers and other forms of school choice is merely a legacy of the 19th-century religious (and ethnic) bigotry of Know-Nothings and Unitarian Protestants toward , all but some Protestant denominations , and even . The Blaine laws that ban school vouchers and other public school dollars for educating kids in parochial settings, for example, were crafted specifically to force the children of Irish Catholic immigrants to become good Americans who followed the Unitarian-inspired civic religion pushed earlier in the century by Horace Mann and his allies. Before that, Protestants, fearful of the influx of Irish Catholics entering the nation (and that they may attempt to put the nation under the control of the Pope), did all they could to effectively squelch Catholicism; in fact, it was this bigotry that led to the mass formation of Catholic diocesan schools that still remain the nation's second-largest collection of education providers. And let's not forget the federal government's effort to \"kill the Indian, save the man\" through Bureau of Indian Education-operated boarding schools that forced kids off reservations and subjected them to educational, physical, and emotional abuse.\n\nThen there is the argument that private-sector involvement in education, be it through companies or nonprofits, is somehow evil. This is a traditionalist argument reformers must also shut down because it is based on a senseless belief that somehow free enterprise and the operations involved in it are somehow evil while government is naturally good and virtuous. Anyone who has lived through Watergate, the Iran-Contra scandal, and even the recent financial meltdown knows that there is nothing true about it. There's nothing inherently virtuous about government-run district schools or anything evil in utero about corporations providing schools. The tax status of the organizations providing education don't matter.\n\nMore importantly, in posing these arguments, traditionalists fail to remember that companies and nonprofits are already critical players in how districts provide public education, from publishing textbooks to providing accounting services. Whether or not those private operators always do a good job in those aspects (or, more importantly, if districts do a good enough job of managing their contractors) is a different discussion. But the reality is that public education is quite dependent on the private sector in order to provide some of the most-critical aspects of educating kids (and especially dependent on companies for the taxes that fund their operations in the first place). This fact should be pointed out ad nauseam.\n\nAnd finally, reformers must point out to traditionalists that public education is not about the kind of organization that provides instruction and curricula, but how it is financed and regulated. Charter schools, private schools, online schools, DIY operations, and even teachers working together or on their own, are as capable to provide high-quality education (and even promote good citizenship) as a traditional district. Based on the track record of late for traditional districts these days, one can even say that the bureaucratic model is outdated and obsolete for this purpose. What matters more is not whether the school operators are government or private, but whether they provide our children with good-to-great teachers, strong, comprehensive college-preparatory curricula, and cultures of genius that nurture the genius inherent in all kids. Those school operators that don't provide this (or behave illegally and unethically), be they traditional, charter, or private, should be shut down and not get public funding, while those that do the job deserve praise and support.\n\nThe warped, anti-intellectual thinking of education traditionalists deserves to be tossed into history's paper shredder. And as reformers, it is our job to battle faulty thinking from whoever poses it.\n\nOver the past decade, followers of the mysterious Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen have opened scores of charter schools in the U.S., inspired by a man who is as powerful as he is reclusive. Lesley Stahl reports.\n\n(CBS News) Fethullah Gulen is the Turkish Islamic cleric at the center of a popular and growing movement, with millions of disciples who follow his teachings of tolerance, interfaith dialogue, and education. Some have even started a chain of successful charter schools here in the U.S., with an emphasis on math and science. Yet Gulen himself remains shrouded in mystery. Lesley Stahl travels from Turkey to Texas to report on how the movement is spreading, and on the man behind it all.\n\nThe following script is from \"The Gulen Movement\" which aired on May 13, 2012. Lesley Stahl is the correspondent. Shachar Bar-On, producer.\n\nOver the past decade scores of charter schools have popped up all over the U.S., all sharing some common features. Most of them are high-achieving academically, they stress math and science, and one more thing: they're founded and largely run by immigrants from Turkey who are carrying out the teachings of a Turkish Islamic cleric: Fethullah Gulen.\n\nHe's the spiritual leader of a growing and increasingly influential force in the Muslim world -- known as \"The Gulen Movement\" -- with millions upon millions of disciples who compare him to Ghandi and Martin Luther King. Gulen promotes tolerance, interfaith dialog, and above-all: he promotes education. And yet he's a mystery man -- he's never seen or heard in public -- and the more power he gains, the more questions are raised about his motives and the schools.\n\nThis is the Harmony School in Houston, part of a rapidly expanding chain of 36 charter schools in Texas. They serve mostly underprivileged students and they all emphasize math and science.\n\n[Student: Inside there is an elastic collision between the gas particles.\n\nStudent: What this is is a static electricity generator?]\n\nClass work stresses hands-on experiments and competitiveness. Students made this hovercraft out of leaf-blowers for a science contest.\n\nBeing a charter chain means these are public schools, costing tax payers nearly $150 million a year.\n\n[Lesley Stahl: So you don't even have a drivers' license yet?\n\nJulie Norton is an administrator with the Harmony chain of schools.\n\nJulie Norton: So we have about 20,000 students.\n\nJulie Norton: Yes, we have a waiting list. We have approximately 30,000 students on our waiting list. We have more students on the waiting list than we have enrolled in the schools.\n\nThe education here gets high marks, as students get state-of-the-art technology and extensive one-on-one tutoring.\n\n[Lesley Stahl: Do you get excited to come to school?\n\nThe enthusiasm is hard to miss, as is the fact that many of the teachers are Turkish, some just recently arrived and hard to understand.\n\n[Lesley Stahl: When did you get here, to the United States?\n\nThere are a total of about 130 charter schools like Harmony in 26 states. Together they form the largest collection of charter schools in the country. Here's what's curious: they're founded and run by immigrant businessmen and academics from Turkey. Why are they building public schools here?\n\nWell, the answer seems to lie with this mystery man: the Turkish imam Fethullah Gulen who tells his followers that to be devout Muslims they shouldn't build mosques - they should build schools; and not to teach religion, but science. In sermons on the web, he actually says: \"Studying physics, mathematics, and chemistry is worshipping God.\" So Gulen's followers have gone out and built over 1,000 schools around the globe - from Turkey to Togo; from Taiwan to Texas.\n\nAlp Aslandogan: His message is that if you want to solve any social problem for the longer term, the solution has to go through education.\n\nLesley Stahl: It's so counterintuitive that people from Turkey would come here to get involved here in education.\n\nAlp Aslandogan: People do go to other countries, including Africa. The United States, especially in math and science, is not really good. And many parents complain about that. So there is a need for skilled teachers in the United States in that fields.\n\nWe went to Turkey to learn more and found Gulen's schools are everywhere and considered the best. They're often multi-million dollar hi-tech facilities where girls are equal to boys and English is taught starting in first grade.\n\nGulen didn't only influence education. Starting in the late 60s, as a young imam, he urged crowds of middle class Turks to learn from the West and embrace its values - including an unexpected one: making money. In this Internet sermon, he even told followers: \"If you don't seek ways to be wealthy...that is a sin in the eyes of God.\" So his disciples in Turkey became successful businessmen and built a multi-billion dollar Gulen empire that beyond the schools, includes TV stations, a major bank, Turkey's largest trade association, and biggest newspaper.\n\nAndrew Finkel: They love capitalism. It really is very much a business network as much as a religion in many ways.\n\nAndrew Finkel, who's been a freelance reporter in Turkey for 25 years, says Gulen tells his followers to reach out to people of other faiths.\n\nAndrew Finkel: Tolerance is a very key, key part of their message. And you know, it's not about, the use of force.\n\nLesley Stahl: It's as far away from Osama bin Laden, as you can get within the religion?\n\nAndrew Finkel: Very, very different. Yes.\n\nLesley Stahl: So I guess one of the big questions is what kind of an Islamic leader is Gulen?\n\nAndrew Finkel: He leads by his own charismatic personality.\n\nLesley Stahl: Would you call it a personality cult?\n\nTo his followers, Gulen's like a living prophet, and he used his influence to change the course of Turkey's politics; helping to make it a functioning moderate Islamic democracy.\n\nOne thing we couldn't find in Turkey was Gulen. Actually, very few people ever see him in person. He preaches via webcasts from a prayer room in an isolated and unlikely location. For over a decade, Gulen has been living in self-imposed exile and seclusion in, of all places, the Poconos - in this gated Pennsylvania retreat.\n\nLesley Stahl: So does Mr. Gulen live in this building?\n\nBekir Aksoy: Yes, in this building.\n\nTo our surprise Bekir Aksoy, who heads the retreat, invited us in even though Gulen had turned us down for an interview.\n\nLesley Stahl: So this is the prayer room. Oh, is that Mr. Gulen's seat? His chair?\n\nBekir Aksoy: Right. Whenever he comes out of his room he sits there and he speaks from there.\n\nLesley Stahl: And that's where he lives? Behind the door?\n\nBekir Aksoy: That is the door behind which Mr. Gulen lives. That is his private room.\n\nGulen lives there alone -- he's never married. The pile of medicine bottles are a reminder that at 70 plus, he's diabetic with heart and kidney problems.\n\nLesley Stahl: Will he come out? Will we get to see him?\n\nBekir Aksoy: Ah... for the last five, six months he's very, very ill really. When he is ill, he does not accept visitors.\n\nWhen Gulen came to the U.S. in 1999, it was for medical treatment. But then this video surfaced in which he seems to order his flock to surreptitiously take over key government positions in Turkey in a stealth Islamic coup. Accused of treason by the government at the time, Gulen decided to stay in the Poconos -- even after he was cleared in 2008 in Abstenia.\n\nLesley Stahl: Why is he still in America?\n\nAndrew Finkel: Well, I think if he were to come back, then there would be such a brouhaha and it would-- I think-- he would be afraid of being seen as being too powerful.\n\nToo powerful because it seems his followers have taken over key positions in the Turkish government and the police.\n\nAndrew Finkel: You know, if he says \"jump,\" people jump. There's no doubt about that.\n\nLesley Stahl: You know we have confronted real fear about this movement, particularly when we've tried to get critics to give us an interview. What are they afraid of?\n\nAndrew Finkel: There's a fear of reprisal. I mean, it is the case that two or three people who've written books highly critical of the Gulen movement are now in jail.\n\nSeeming to have such power, this \"Wizard of Oz\" recluse invites conspiracy theories that he's running Turkey from the Poconos and is bent on global Muslim domination. His movement does lack transparency: its funding, hierarchy, and ambitions remain hidden -- leading our State Department to wonder in cables between Ankara and Washington if Gulen has an \"insidious political agenda.\"\n\nAnd now some of the suspicion revolves around the U.S. schools. Do they serve a function other than educating our kids? One accusation involves immigration fraud: that the schools are providing work visas for hundreds of Gulen followers from Turkey.\n\nLesley Stahl: And that the whole idea is just to get Turks to come into the United States and this is an easy avenue for them.\n\nDavid Dunn: Which is just categorically not true.\n\nDavid Dunn of the Texas Charter Schools Association says that because of a deficit of qualified Americans, the schools bring in math and science teachers from Turkey, as this list of visa applications indicates. Problem is -\n\nLesley Stahl: We've seen that some of these visas for Turkish teachers to come here are for English - for them to teach English. How does that make any sense?\n\nDavid Dunn: I'm not aware of that. I don't-- I can't, I can't comment on that. I don't know. I have not looked intimately into the visas they bring in.\n\nLesley Stahl: We have English teachers in this country.\n\nDavid Dunn: English teachers are typically not part of the critical -- or the deficit.\n\nMary Addi: Our tax dollars are paying for them to come over here and take our jobs.\n\nMary Addi was fired as a teacher from a school in Cleveland, Ohio -- part of a Gulen-inspired chain of 27 charter schools in the Midwest.\n\nMary Addi: They want to give you the impression that they're just hard-workin' guys over here to try to educate our kids because American teachers are just too stupid.\n\nLesley Stahl: As far as you know, why is an Islamic imam, which Gulen is, interested in setting up schools in the United States?\n\nGulen's followers can make money thru contracts to build and maintain the schools, but Addi has gone to law enforcement with charges that the schools also make money by bringing in foreign teachers in order to take a cut of their salaries. She says she learned this after marrying a Turkish teacher.\n\nMary Addi: And that's when he told me that every pay period, he would have to cash his check and give-- he had to give 40 percent of his check back because--\n\nLesley Stahl: And you've turned documents over to various federal agencies that you say proves this on paper?\n\nThe schools dismiss Addi's claims, calling her a disgruntled employee. But federal authorities told us they take her seriously and are looking into allegations of immigration fraud and misuse of taxpayer money in various states, and whether it's somehow being funneled to the Gulen movement.\n\nThen - there's the Internet, where there are incendiary blogs accusing the schools of secretly promoting \"an Islamic agenda.\"\n\nLesley Stahl: You know there are various blogs that have accused these schools of being backdoor Madrassas.\n\nLesley Stahl: So do you think there's a little bit Islamophobia involved?\n\nDavid Dunn: I think there's clearly some anti-Islam bias involved in these blogs.\n\nActually, we looked into this and Islam is not taught at all. That would be illegal since these are public schools that go out of their way to distance themselves from any religious affiliation - even denying a connection to the Gulen movement.\n\nDavid Dunn: I think what matters is the results in the classrooms. Are kids learning math, science, reading, writing at a superior level? And clearly in these schools that's happening.\n\nIt is happening: Newsweek voted two Harmony schools among America's top 10. More of these schools open every year across the country, and waiting lists just keep getting longer. Gulenists tell us the schools are about reading, writing, and arithmetic, not religion.\n\nAnd Bekir Aksoy in the Poconos says the man behind the door has no hidden agenda: Fethullah Gulen hasn't even visited any of the schools.\n\nBekir Aksoy: He does not want to see the fruits of his work. He just speaks and encourages people to be good human beings.\n\nLesley Stahl: That's interesting because there are schools in Pennsylvania. I mean, not that far.\n\nBekir Aksoy: He has not seen any of them, believe me. He does not leave that room.",

unstoppable rate that could cause worldwide sea levels to rise far quicker than previously thought scientists said in a report released monday a team of researchers from nasa and the university of california said the ice sheets will continue to retreat for decades or even centuries to come regardless of any human effort to reduce carbon emissions a primary cause of climate change – though warming temperatures could accelerate the process the new data could mean that the intergovernmental panel on climate changes ipcc prediction last month of a threefoot sea level rise by 2100 may have to be increased by as much as four feet the study said the report represents the crossing of a critical threshold in understanding antarctic ice sheets said researchers at nasa and the university of california irvine who were behind the study conclusions in the report are based on 40 years of observation of the rapidly melting amundsen sea sector of west antarctica six glaciers in the sector have entered an unstoppable retreat that has passed the point of no return the researchers said it has been compared to a wine bottle that has a cork at the front where the cork represents the ice shelf said eric rignot professor of earth system science at the uc irvine and glaciologist at nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif said in a conference monday were at the point where we can say the bottle has been uncorked rignot said at a news conference monday the guardian the collapse of the western antarctic ice sheet is inevitable and is already underway scientists said on monday the melt will cause up to four metres 13 feet of additional sealevel rise over the coming centuries devastating lowlying and coastal areas around the world – from bangladesh to new jersey – that are already expected to be swamped by only a few feet of sealevel rise but the researchers said the sealevel rise – while unstoppable – was still several centuries off potentially up to 1000 years away the study from researchers at the university of washington was one of two sets of findings published on monday projecting the loss of the western antarctica ice sheet the largest remaining grounded repositories of ice in the world scientists at nasa were also due to publish their research on antarctic ice on monday both came to broadly similar conclusions – that scientists are now increasingly sure the thinning and melting of the antarctic ice sheet has begun they also suggest that recent accumulation of ice in antarctica was temporary new york times the collapse of large parts of the ice sheet in west antarctica appears to have begun and is almost certainly unstoppable with global warming accelerating the pace of the disintegration two groups of scientists reported monday the finding which had been feared by some scientists for decades means that a rise in global sea level of at least 10 feet may now be inevitable the rise may continue to be relatively slow for at least the next century or so the scientists said but sometime after that it will probably speed up so sharply as to become a crisis this is really happening said thomas p wagner who runs nasas programs on polar ice and helped oversee some of the research theres nothing to stop it now but you are still limited by the physics of how fast the ice can flow bbc key glaciers in west antarctica are in an irreversible retreat a study team led by the us space agency nasa says it analysed 40 years of observations of six big ice streams draining into the amundsen bay and concluded that nothing now can stop them melting away although these are abrupt changes the timescales involved are likely measured in centuries the researchers add if the glaciers really do disappear they would add roughly 12m to global sea level rise the new study has been accepted for publication in geophysical research letters a journal of the american geophysical union but nasa held a teleconference on monday to brief reporters on the findings prof eric rignot said warm ocean water was relentlessly eating away at the glaciers fronts and that the geometry of the sea bed in the area meant that this erosion had now entered a runaway process usa today the vast glaciers of western antarctica are rapidly losing ice to the sea and almost certainly have passed the point of no return according to new work by two separate teams of scientists the likely result a rise in global sea levels of 4 feet or more in the coming centuries says research made public monday by scientists at the university of washington the university of californiairvine and nasas jet propulsion laboratory it really is an amazingly distressing situation says pennsylvania state university glaciologist sridhar anandakrishnan who was not affiliated with either study this is a huge part of west antarctica and it seems to have been kicked over the edge the researchers say the fate of the glaciers is almost certainly beyond hope one study shows that a river of ice called thwaites glacier is probably in the early stages of collapse total collapse is almost inevitable the study shows thwaites glacier is a huge ice stream draining into the amundsen

            "text": "One study shows that a river of ice called Thwaites Glacier is probably in the early stages of collapse. Total collapse is almost inevitable, the study shows.\n\nThe researchers say the fate of the glaciers is almost certainly beyond hope.\n\n\"It really is an amazingly distressing situation,\" says Pennsylvania State University glaciologist Sridhar Anandakrishnan, who was not affiliated with either study. \"This is a huge part of West Antarctica, and it seems to have been kicked over the edge.\"\n\nThe likely result: a rise in global sea levels of 4 feet or more in the coming centuries, says research made public Monday by scientists at the University of Washington, the University of California-Irvine and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nProf Eric Rignot said warm ocean water was relentlessly eating away at the glaciers' fronts and that the geometry of the sea bed in the area meant that this erosion had now entered a runaway process.\n\nThe new study has been accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal of the American Geophysical Union, but Nasa held a teleconference on Monday to brief reporters on the findings.\n\nIf the glaciers really do disappear, they would add roughly 1.2m to global sea level rise.\n\nAlthough these are abrupt changes, the timescales involved are likely measured in centuries, the researchers add.\n\nIt analysed 40 years of observations of six big ice streams draining into the Amundsen Bay and concluded that nothing now can stop them melting away.\n\n“This is really happening,” said Thomas P. Wagner, who runs NASA’s programs on polar ice and helped oversee some of the research. “There’s nothing to stop it now. But you are still limited by the physics of how fast the ice can flow.”\n\nThe finding, which had been feared by some scientists for decades, means that a rise in global sea level of at least 10 feet may now be inevitable. The rise may continue to be relatively slow for at least the next century or so, the scientists said, but sometime after that it will probably speed up so sharply as to become a crisis.\n\nBoth came to broadly similar conclusions – that scientists are now increasingly sure the thinning and melting of the Antarctic ice sheet has begun. They also suggest that recent accumulation of ice in Antarctica was temporary.\n\nScientists at Nasa were also due to publish their research on Antarctic ice on Monday.\n\nThe study, from researchers at the University of Washington, was one of two sets of findings published on Monday projecting the loss of the western Antarctica ice sheet, the largest remaining grounded repositories of ice in the world.\n\nBut the researchers said the sea-level rise – while unstoppable – was still several centuries off, potentially up to 1,000 years away.\n\nThe melt will cause up to four metres (13 feet) of additional sea-level rise over the coming centuries, devastating low-lying and coastal areas around the world – from Bangladesh to New Jersey – that are already expected to be swamped by only a few feet of sea-level rise.\n\n“We’re at the point where we can say the bottle has been uncorked,” Rignot said at a news conference Monday.\n\n“It has been compared to a wine bottle that has a cork at the front, where the cork represents the ice shelf,” said Eric Rignot, professor of Earth system science at the UC Irvine and glaciologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said in a conference Monday.\n\nConclusions in the report are based on 40 years of observation of the rapidly melting Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica. Six glaciers in the sector have entered an “unstoppable” retreat that has “passed the point of no return,” the researchers said.\n\nThe report represents the crossing of a “critical threshold” in understanding Antarctic ice sheets, said researchers at NASA and the University of California, Irvine, who were behind the study.\n\nThe new data could mean that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) prediction last month of a three-foot sea level rise by 2100 may have to be increased by as much as four feet, the study said.\n\nA team of researchers from NASA and the University of California said the ice sheets will continue to retreat for decades or even centuries to come, regardless of any human effort to reduce carbon emissions a primary cause of climate change – though warming temperatures could accelerate the process.\n\nPlease feel free to share your articles and stories in the comments.\n\nWelcome to the Overnight News Digest with a crew consisting of founder Magnifico, current leader Neon Vincent, regular editors side pocket, maggiejean, wader, Man Oh Man, rfall, and JML9999.

Snowplows cleared the way for the Monday morning rush hour after the storm, which is expected to taper off by midday, blanketed Denver with more than 4 inches and the mountains northeast of Steamboat Springs with 36 inches of snow, said Jim Kalina, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder, Colorado. No significant delays or cancellations were reported at Denver International Airport, and no records were broken in a state used to late spring snowstorms like the one that dumped 10.7 inches of snow on May 26, 1950. \"That's Colorado for you,\" said Kalina. Snow has been falling and accumulating over the past four days in Colorado, said Pat Slattery, weather service spokesman. Deep snow measuring 27 inches also was reported in the Uinta Mountains in northeastern Utah, said NWS meteorologist Tom Renwick. Hail and damaging winds were forecast for Monday in parts of Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, southeast Kansas, Oklahoma, central Texas, Arkansas, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, northern Indiana and northwest Ohio, Slattery said.\n\nUnions representing employees of ITV’s newly acquired production company in the US are calling on the British broadcaster to improve benefits for its American workers. Following the $360m acquisition of Leftfield last week, and other acquisitions in the past two years, the Writers Guild of America East (WGAE) and the AFL-CIO want ITV to provide similar benefits to its American workers as those offered in the UK. “Not only is ITV currently making profits and not giving benefits to its writer-producers but it anticipates even bigger profits, big enough to justify that investment,” said WGAE executive director Lowell Peterson. The guild is seeking minimum levels of compensation, health benefits and paid time off. At least 100 writer-producers cycle through ITV productions during the year. Currently, ITV employs 40 WGAE members in New York. Producers and associate producers first voted to be represented by the WGAE in collective bargaining three years ago, because ITV does not provide benefits to the producers and writers at the other US-based production companies it owns.\n\nI'm not a racist,\" Donald Sterling tells CNN in an interview about the scandal that brought a lifetime ban from the NBA. \"I made a terrible, terrible mistake. And I'm here with you today to apologize and to ask for forgiveness for all the people that I've hurt.\" Sterling also said he isn't likely to engage in a drawn-out legal battle with the NBA if the league attempts to force him out as the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers. Both Sterling and his wife recently recorded high-profile interviews — Shelly with ABC's Barbara Walters, and Donald with CNN's Anderson Cooper. \"I was baited,\" Donald Sterling tells Cooper. \"I mean, that's not the way I talk. I don't talk about people for one thing — ever. I talk about ideas and other things, but I don't talk about people.\" The Clippers owner was banned by the NBA on April 29, days after a recording emerged in which he made racist remarks. Commissioner Adam Silver also urged Sterling's fellow owners to force him to sell the team. Sterling tells Cooper that he doesn't know how the recording was released; he also says, \"I don't know why the girl had me say those things.\"\n\nFirst of a two-part report. The neo-Nazi charged with killing three people at Jewish centers outside Kansas City last month drove there from his home in the Ozarks, a hilly, rural, largely conservative part of southern Missouri and northern Arkansas with a history of attracting white supremacists. The Kansas murders sparked a painful discussion in the shooter's community in Marionville, Mo., where bigotry is an especially divisive subject. \"I am not blind to the shortcomings of this area, and I will tell you, as a native, we are still mired in the past,\" says Nancy Allen, a professor and author in nearby Springfield, Mo. Allen says most black residents fled Springfield after three black men were lynched on the town square in 1906. That left it a largely white city in a very white region endowed with a fiercely independent and insular culture. Allen calls it the \"code of the hills.\"\n\nWhen stories began to emerge about the U.S. government's massive surveillance of Americans' phone and Internet communications, it was no surprise to a group of analysts who left the National Security Agency soon after the Sept. 11 attacks. Those analysts, who'd worked on systems to detect terrorist threats, left in part because they saw the NSA embarking on a surveillance program they regarded as unconstitutional and unnecessary. Two of those analysts, Bill Binney and Kirk Wiebe, are interviewed in a Frontline documentary called United States of Secrets, which airs Tuesday night. Binney was a crypto-mathematician who worked as technical director of the NSA's World Geopolitical and Military Analysis Reporting Group. Wiebe was a senior analyst who was awarded the NSA's Meritorious Civilian Service Award, the agency's second highest honor. Before the Sept. 11 attacks, Binney led a team that created a program called \"Thin Thread\" which could gather and analyze enormous amounts of Internet and telephone traffic, and encrypt the identities of people in the U.S. so that their privacy was protected. Both Binney and Wiebe left the agency in 2001 after working there for decades, and have publicly criticized the course the NSA has taken. Both were also eventually targeted in a leak investigation by the FBI that led to their homes being raided. After they left the NSA, they joined others in filing a complaint with the inspector general of the Defense Department about the agency's use of private contractors to develop a surveillance system the analysts regarded as expensive, ineffective and abusive of citizens' constitutional rights.\n\nWhen Neil J. McNeill Jr., principal of the Middle School for Art and Philosophy in Brooklyn, learned that fewer than 4 percent of his students had passed state exams in math last year, he was frustrated. It so happened that he shared a building with one of the top-performing schools in the Brownsville neighborhood, Kings Collegiate Charter School, where 37 percent of the students had passed, well above the New York City middle-school average of 27 percent. Mr. McNeill had long been curious about the charter school’s strategies: It, too, served large numbers of low-income black students, many from the same neighborhoods. But the two schools operated in their own bubbles, with separate public-address systems and different textbooks. And as a matter of practice, they did not talk about academics. “We are kind of two ships in the night,” Mr. McNeill, 39, said recently. A primary rationale for the creation of charter schools, which are publicly financed and privately run, was to develop test kitchens for practices that could be exported into the traditional schools. President Obama, in recently proclaiming “National Charter Schools Week,” said they “can provide effective approaches for the broader public education system.”\n\nHarvard University extension school students planning a “satanic black mass” canceled the event after an outcry by administration, students, faculty and religious leaders. The Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club had decided to move the event off campus after widespread objections, and no other location was willing to host it, according to an e-mailed statement from the group. “Given that no other location has been willing to intercede, we will no longer be sponsoring this black mass,” the group said in the statement. The university had decided not to block the event, even though President Drew Faust said she opposed it. A parody of the Roman Catholic mass, the black mass was to be held in the Queen’s Head Pub in Memorial Hall’s basement, according to a club announcement. Preregistration was required and attendance was full, the club had said in a statement earlier today\n\nThe United States has been flying \"manned\" missions over Nigeria to track down more than 200 abducted schoolgirls, the Pentagon said, as experts pored over a new video, seeking clues to where they are being held. \"We have shared commercial satellite imagery with the Nigerians and are flying manned ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) assets over Nigeria with the government's permission,\" a senior administration official told AFP news agency on Monday, asking not to be named.

A 16-year-old girl has just informed her on the phone that she \"was threatened with a weapon.\" Rama works at \"Helpline 181,\" an emergency service for women. \"I like to work here,\" says the 20-year-old, adding that \"in my own case, the police did not help me and I felt being left alone. By working here, I can help other women so that they have it better.\"\n\n Rama has herself experienced sexually harassment. For years, she was stalked and groped by a much older man, who was a family friend. When she finally told her mother about it, she persuaded Rama not to complain to the police.\n\nThe dozens of young women corralled into a clearing to recite the first chapter of the Qur'an, their palms turned upwards in prayer but their collective gaze fixed mainly on the forest floor on which they sit, have, in their captors' words, been \"liberated\". Few, though, seem to be relishing their four weeks of freedom. Some shut their eyes tight in concentration or perhaps fear; others fidget, glance about and let the phrase \"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful\" emerge through nearly motionless lips. On Monday, almost a month after they were kidnapped, some of the 276 Nigerian girls snatched from their school under cover of darkness appeared to re-emerge in a propaganda video shot by Boko Haram, the Islamist group that has in recent days acquired the notoriety it has sought for years. The 27-minute film, stamped with the logo of a pair of crossed Kalashnikovs, a black flag and an open Qur'an, shows around 130 girls wearing grey and black veils. Two of them speak of their conversion from Christianity to Islam.\n\nAt least 14 people have died after a boat sank in the Mediterranean between Libya and Italy in the latest disaster to hit the relentlessly busy migration route, the Italian navy said. Two commercial ships are reported to have been first at the scene of the shipwreck on Monday, which occurred in international waters about 40 miles from the Libyan coast and 100 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa. More than 200 migrants have been saved, the navy said in a statement, but it is unclear how many were on board the boat before it ran into trouble. Giuseppe Cannarile, commander of the Lampadusa coast guard, was quoted by Italian media as saying: \"The number of people on board is not yet known but the survivors say there were hundreds.\" The navy said the number of 14 deaths was not definitive as the rescue effort – involving two Italian navy ships and three patrol boats two belonging to the Italian coast guard and the Guardia di Finanza police was continuing.\n\nWhen news spread last week that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was near an acquisition of Beats Electronics LLC for $3.2 billion, Beats co-founder Dr. Dre appeared in a video boasting of becoming the “first billionaire in hip hop.” The differing reactions underline the seemingly odd cultural fit between the world’s most valuable company and a celebrity-fronted Santa Monica, California-based provider of headphones and online music. Beats executives are known to throw lavish parties and have musicians traipsing through at all hours, while Apple is an engineering haven for coders and designers. Yet underneath those surface differences, the two companies are more aligned than it might appear, with deep ties to one another. Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine, a longtime producer and executive, was friendly with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and is a big supporter of the company’s efforts in music. Apple, meanwhile, has cultivated extensive relationships in the music business and its iTunes team is populated with former radio promoters, music writers and other industry veterans. The familiarity may help Apple more quickly reap the benefits of a deal once it’s completed.\n\nNANYANG, CHINA — There’s an old saying in the American West: “Water flows uphill toward money.” The same holds true in China, where engineers are building a 1,500-mile network of canals and tunnels to divert water from the rain-abundant south to Beijing and other wealthy northern cities. Costing an estimated $62 billion, the South-North Water Transfer Project is the largest public works undertaking in China since the Three Gorges Dam, and even more gargantuan in scale. Parts of the project are behind schedule and over budget, but the costs go far beyond money. The government has relocated more than 330,000 villagers for the project, and many are angry over lost farmland and compensation they say was skimmed off by corrupt local officials. “We were willing to sacrifice the small family for the good of the big family _ the nation,” said one villager, Jia, whom McClatchy interviewed. But the government, he said, “has not kept its promises.”\n\nGeneral Motors on Monday spelled out how much customers will have to pay to access the cellular network through its new cars. The 2015 Chevrolet Malibu will be the first of a fleet of more than 30 GM models that will come with a 4G LTE connection powered by AT&T this year. Customers get either three months or 3 gigabytes of data as part of a free trial, and can re-up with plans that range between $5 and $50. The vehicle data plans represent a potentially lucrative new business for GM. The automaker hopes connected cars will generate additional service revenue, augmenting its traditional core automotive sales and its separate OnStar monitoring and assistance service. An LTE connection could potentially give it an edge over competitors and increase customer loyalty. \"Our objective here is to allow you to bring your digital life in your vehicle, and your vehicle into your digital life,\" Terry Inch, chief operating officer for GM's OnStar unit, said in an interview. With an LTE connection, the car can act as a Wi-Fi hotspot that can connect up to seven devices. The connection also will help augment OnStar coverage and services\n\nTwitter users can now mute others, meaning that their tweets will not show up in a timeline. The new feature, which Twitter announced in a blog post Monday, allows you to avoid seeing tweets from people you'd rather avoid. However, they will still be able to see your tweets and retweets. The new tool appears to be what Twitter was aiming for when it briefly changed its blocking policy in December, igniting a firestorm of controversy. \"In the same way you can turn on device notifications so you never miss a tweet from your favorite users, you can now mute users you'd like to hear from less,\" Twitter wrote in its blog post. \"Muting a user on Twitter means their tweets and retweets will no longer be visible in your home timeline, and you will no longer receive push or SMS notifications from that user.\" However, Twitter noted, muting someone does not mean they will not be able to see your tweets or retweets.\n\nAT&T Inc is in active talks to buy satellite TV provider DirecTV and may complete a deal in the next few weeks that could be worth close to $50 billion, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday. The second-largest wireless operator is discussing an offer in the low- to mid-$90s per share for DirecTV, one of the people said, compared with the company's closing price of $87.16 on Monday. A bid near $95 per share would value DirecTV at more than $48 billion based on its shares outstanding, and would represent a premium of more than 20 percent to its stock price before news of AT&T's interest first emerged on May 1. The deal price has yet to be finalized and terms could still change, the people said, adding that discussions are continuing. They asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Other details also have yet to be worked out, such as a break-up fee as well as a potential role for DirecTV Chief Executive Officer Mike White, the second person said.",

            "text": "LANSING, Michigan (May 5, 2014) – As the country observes National Charter Schools Week, a new poll shows that Michigan residents overwhelmingly favor charter schools and educational choice. A scientific poll of 600 likely voters in Michigan, conducted in March by the Marketing Resource Group (MRG), showed that 82.8 percent of respondents favor giving parents a choice in picking the right school for their child. Only 12.8 percent of respondents said they opposed educational choice. Support for charter schools was also very strong. The poll showed that 68 percent of Michigan residents favor charter schools, while only 21.3 percent oppose them. The poll of 600 likely voters was conducted March 24-28 by MRG. It has a margin of error of 4.1 percent. “Every student deserves a quality education in a quality school, and for that to happen, parents must be empowered to make the right educational choice for their child,” said Dan Quisenberry, President of the Michigan Association of Public School Academies (MAPSA), the state charter school association. “It’s refreshing to see once again that Michigan residents recognize this. Charter schools are not only extremely popular in Michigan; they’re also very successful. Michigan’s charter schools have shown that innovation and accountability will lead to high student achievement. As a state, our goal now has to be that every child is enrolled in a quality school.” In the MRG poll, respondents were asked, “Do you favor or oppose giving Michigan parents options when choosing a public school for their children?” A total of 60.8 percent of respondents said they were strongly in favor, while 22 percent were somewhat in favor. Only 7.8 percent strongly opposed school choice, while 5 percent were somewhat opposed. The poll also asked, “As you may know, charter schools are independent public schools that offer parents an alternative to traditional public schools. Charter schools can be organized by education advocates, as long as they receive approval from a public sponsor such as a school district or a university. Do you favor or oppose charter schools in Michigan?” A total of 36.5 percent of respondents said that strongly favor charter schools, while 31.5 percent said they somewhat favored them. Only 13.3 percent were strongly opposed to charter schools, while 8 percent were somewhat opposed. May 4-10 is being observed as National Charter Schools Week across the country, as proclaimed by President Barack Obama. The president issued a proclamation on Sunday in favor of charter schools, saying, “As independent public schools, charter schools have the ability to try innovative approaches to teaching and learning in the classroom. This flexibility comes with high standards and accountability; charter schools must demonstrate that all their students are progressing toward academic excellence. Those that do not measure up can be shut down. And those that are successful can provide effective approaches for the broader public education system. They can show what is possible -- schools that give every student the chance to prepare for college and career and to develop a love of learning that lasts a lifetime.” MAPSA has introduced a new tool to help parents find the right educational choice for their child: ChoicesInEducation.com. The online tool allows parents to search for quality schools in their area, comparing educational models, data and more. The Michigan Association of Public School Academies advances quality education through choice and innovation. MAPSA has been the unified voice of the public charter school movement in Michigan since 1996. MAPSA represents more than 141,000 students, 6,000 teachers, dozens of authorizers and more than 50 education service providers working in 297 public charter schools in the state. MAPSA assists the state’s public charter schools in their mission to deliver achievement, choice and accountability through advocacy, communications, technical assistance and professional development services.

Other model Bronx schools that have put out the welcome mat include Eagle Academy for Young Men, KIPP Academy Middle School and Bronx Charter School for Excellence. In each school, educators can observe classes, participate in professional development sessions and discuss common techniques.\n\n“I’m looking forward to really begin sharing ideas, regardless of what our models are,” said Charlene Reid, head of the Bronx Charter School for Excellence. “We all have the same goals. We’re all NYC educators. We’re excited to open up our doors for all educators who want to inquire and begin to work together, because these are all the same students in the Bronx and we want to deliver for them.”\n\nParent activist Mona Davids, who has a daughter at Equality Charter School in the Bronx, said she hopes participants include the ones who need this initiative most - struggling schools and schools on the chopping block.\n\n“They need to go and partner with the schools already on the hit list, and the schools that have received consecutive Cs, Ds and Fs, and give them the support that they need,” said Davids, president of NYC Parents Union. “Since charters are supposed to be labs for innovation, I think they should be partnering with failing district schools.”",

Hernández, New York Times, May 11, 2014\n\n…But two decades since the schools began to appear, educators from both systems concede that very little of what has worked for charter schools has found its way into regular classrooms. Testy political battles over space and money, including one that became glaringly public in New York State this spring, have inhibited attempts at collaboration. The sharing of school buildings, which in theory should foster communication, has more frequently led to conflict.\n\nAnd some charter schools have veered so sharply from the traditional model — with longer school years, armies of nonunion workers and flashy enrichment opportunities like trips to the Galápagos Islands — that their ideas are viewed as unworkable in regular schools.\n\nIn recent years, educational leaders, concerned about hostilities between the two types of schools, have worked to encourage warmer relations. In Tulsa, Okla., charter schools and district schools are working together to improve teaching quality. And in Spring Branch, Tex., charter school leaders are helping train district teachers and principals…..\n\n…Education experts said it might prove difficult to encourage the kind of sharing of ideas that charter schools were originally supposed to foster, given competitive dynamics. Charter schools serve about 5 percent of public-school students nationwide, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, up from about 1 percent in 2003. In some cities, like Detroit, New Orleans and Washington, the percentages are much higher.

            "text": "I’ve lost a bit of weight. Not much — I still have 12 pounds to go before the CDC no longer considers me overweight — but enough that my clothes don’t fit right anymore. As much fun as it is to be able to insert your fist between your stomach and waistband, it’s equally a pain to have to keep hitching your pants up. So I’ve been rewarding myself with a little shopping. The closeout place I like for cheap workout gear and this ‘n’ that has been throwing one of these into their delivery boxes:\n\nSpeaking of losing weight. Let’s see if we can count all the silliness just on the front of the label. These are “dark chocolate covered real fruit juice pieces.” Please explain how juice, a liquid, can come in a “piece.” Then there’s the mysterious açai berry, which I’ve been seeing in my junk mail for a couple years now — apparently it’s a superfood, or a weight-loss aid, or something. But there’s blueberry in there, too; I have to assume it’s juice, so… this is a mixture of acai and blueberry juice, somehow pieced out and covered with dark chocolate. It’s a “natural source of flavanol antioxidants.” What is this stuff, anyway? It’s health-food candy. It’s not a Snickers bar, it has antioxidants! Antioxidants go in pursuit of free radicals in your body, which everybody knows are rilly, rilly bad. So eat the candy. Guilt-free.\n\nIt was tasty, I’ll give it that. Sixty-five calories.\n\nGetting back to the CDC and its body-mass index, which has been criticized for being stupid and inaccurate: I’m going to keep trying to lose, but entirely without any pressure or expectation; the BMI is just a guideline. After years of being nauseated by my thighs (but not enough to lose my appetite), I’ve decided to accept them. I’ve said before that the truth of being female in this culture is, the body you hate today will be the one you wish you still had tomorrow, and I’m going to appreciate mine while it still works and is still relatively pain-free. Strength, flexibility, balance, fun — if it hits on at least three of those cylinders most of the time, I’m going to call it a good day.\n\nYoga helps with all of this, which may explain its popularity. But for someone like me and, maybe, you — those of us whose heads tend to go buzz buzz buzz all the livelong day — it provides a solid hour in which the sole command is: Pay attention. I have a couple of good teachers at the moment, who are gentle and kind and walk that careful yoga line between too little and too much woo-woo. The other day I was sitting in the deepest twist I could muster, concentrating on breathing and back muscles, and reflected that most of us pay attention to our stomachs and genitals and not much else. I’m willing to believe that breathing deeply in this twist somehow makes my internal organs happy. How can thousands of years of flexible little Indian dudes be entirely wrong?\n\nI can’t get on the antioxidants bandwagon, but I will eat their candy when it comes along.\n\nSorry to be boring.\n\nWe’ve discussed the wedding-industrial complex here many times, but I thought this blog post from Esquire.com made an important point: As a proportion of wealth, the typical American wedding is far more expensive than the Kanye/Kardashian affair in Florence over the weekend. And then there’s this part:\n\nThe culture that demands a big wedding hurts the poor worst of all. In 2005′s “Promises I Can Keep: Why Poor Women Put Motherhood Before Marriage,” Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas explained why even women who didn’t have much money wanted a lavish wedding. “Having the wherewithal to throw a ‘big’ wedding is a vivid display that the couple has achieved enough financial security to do more than live from paycheck to paycheck, a stressful situation that most believe leads almost inevitably to divorce. Hosting a “proper” wedding is a sign that the couple only plans to do it once, “given the obvious financial sacrifice.” This is the equivalent, financially, of cutting of your arm to demonstrate how strong you are. The needs of a big wedding also leads to poor people marrying later and less often than rich people, which brings with it a host of negative socioeconomic consequences.\n\nThe father of a young man gunned down Friday during the rampage in Santa Barbara said he is asking members of Congress to stop calling him to offer condolences but nothing more for the death of his only child, Christopher Michaels-Martinez. “I don’t care about your sympathy. I don’t give a s— that you feel sorry for me,” Richard Martinez said during an extensive interview, his face flushed as tears rolled down his face. “Get to work and do something. I’ll tell the president the same thing if he calls me. Getting a call from a politician doesn’t impress me.”\n\nIf a few more people said that to a few more members of Congress, daily, things might change in Washington. Maybe.\n\nLet’s go out on a bitter laugh; the Onion nails it with just the headline: ‘No Way To Prevent This,’ Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens",

            "text": "From the halls of Congress to the Oval Office and from coast to coast, it was clear that just about everyone was getting into the celebration of National Charter Schools Week. Last week's celebration got things going with President Obama’s proclamation expressing support for charter schools and their valuable contribution to education and culminated with an overwhelming vote of confidence by the House of Representatives to increase funding for charter schools to tune of 300 million dollars.\n\nWhy the support? To help understand this, it's important to remember that charter schools are public schools. In other words, charter schools are publicly funded institutions by taxpayers like you. They are not private schools and must, by law, be open to all students.\n\nCharter schools have been around for over twenty years and grew out of a response to foster innovation and flexibility in our country’s public education system. Because charter schools are independent, they are free to operate without having to comply with many of the guidelines governing most public schools. This has allowed charter schools to experiment with things like lengthening the school day to instituting dress codes.\n\nThis innovation has allowed educators and school administrators to teach in their classrooms in ways that would have been difficult, if not impossible, in the traditional public school system.\n\nAnd as it turns out, public charter schools are a big hit. So much so that the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, a non-profit committed to advancing the public charter school movement, estimates that there are over 1 million students names on public charter school wait lists. In two of our country’s biggest states, there are over 150,000 students waiting to attend charter schools in California and New York.\n\nWord has gotten out that many in the more than 2.5 million students enrolled in over 6,500 charter schools are excelling academically. There are many studies confirming this including a study by Stanford in 2013 that found that charter school students were outperforming their public school counterparts in 25 states, including New York City and Washington, D.C., in reading.\n\nIn short, there is not enough supply for the demand. This was the point of a graphic we posted to Facebook last week:\n\nAnd yet, charter schools are not without critics. Some contend that some charter schools are ineffective. But as the President’s own proclamation makes clear: “Those that do not measure up can be shut down. And those that are successful can provide effective approaches for the broader public education system.”\n\nIn short: charter schools help kids succeed while instilling some healthy competition into our education system. And at a time when innovation, and even competition, is nearly unanimously celebrated in other industries like say telecommunications, Hollywood and air-travel, National Charter Schools Week is a reminder of the positive disruption that is happening in education.\n\nThat competition, and the success that comes from it, is on display every year, during a different weeklong celebration: National School Choice Week. This January, more than 5,200 schools celebrated their successes during the Week, with schools of all types (including 1,000+ public charter schools) taking the time to recognize the parents who have actively chosen the schools that work best for their children.\n\nAnd if that were not reason enough to celebrate National Charter Schools Week, then consider the fact that support for charter schools runs the political ideological spectrum. And at a time when it seems like we can’t agree on anything, supporting charter schools – and in fact, a variety of educational choices for families – is bringing together people and groups that normally don’t see eye to eye on many issues.\n\nIt's becoming increasingly clear that far from being a political issue, supporting charter schools is just common sense.\n\nIsrael Ortega is the Media Relations Director of National School Choice Week.

Balls.\n\nSome good bloggage today. Let’s start with a category called Fiery Oratory. Emily Bazelon reviews Glenn Greenwald’s new book in Slate:\n\nA million jokesters have invited the NSA to listen in on their calls about feeding the cat or picking up the kids, noting that most Americans aren’t doing anything exciting enough to interest the government. You are missing the point if you’re in this camp, Greenwald urges: Of course, dutiful, loyal supporters of the president and his policies, good citizens who do nothing to attract negative attention from the powerful, have no reason to fear the surveillance state. This is the case in every society: those who pose no challenge are rarely targeted by oppressive measures, and from their perspective, they can then convince themselves that oppression does not really exist. But the true measure of a society’s freedom is how it treats its dissidents and other marginalized groups, not how it treats good loyalists. … We shouldn’t have to be faithful loyalists of the powerful to feel safe from state surveillance. Nor should the price of immunity be refraining from controversial or provocative dissent. We shouldn’t want a society where the message is conveyed that you will be left alone only if you mimic the accommodating behavior and conventional wisdom of a Washington establishment columnist. …Reading about all the disclosures again, woven together and in context, I couldn’t decide which was worse: the NSA’s massive, grim overreach, in the hands of Director Michael Hayden—or the complicity of almost every other entity involved, private as well as public. “PRISM is a team sport!” trumpeted one NSA memo. Too true: Other memos and slides show Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Microsoft easing the way toward surveillance of their users. (Twitter was the exception in this case.) When the Guardian and the Washington Post broke that news, the tech companies tried to argue otherwise based on a technicality. But looking back, the documents “give the lie to Silicon Valley’s denials of cooperation,” as Greenwald writes.\n\nI will be reading this, most likely. Eventually. After I read everything else I’m supposed to read. Someone recently recommended “Hellhound on His Trail,” the story of the manhunt for James Earl Ray, describing how great it was, etc., and all I could think was, dammit, another one.\n\nMore fiery oratory, from Gene Weingarten, speaking at Joe McGinniss’ memorial service:\n\nWhen a writer enters into an agreement with a source to tell his story, there is always an accompanying covenant. This will be acknowledged by, you know, every journalist who is not too stupid or full of himself to notice what is going on. In return for fair and objective reporting, the subject is promising to tell the truth. If the subject lies to the writer, all bets are off. The degree to which this principle attaches is directly proportional to the enormity of the lie that was told.\n\nHe’s speaking of the teapot tempest that followed a New Yorker piece that was about “Fatal Vision,” called “The Journalist and the Murderer.” The writer, Janet Malcolm, implied that McGinniss had betrayed Jeffrey MacDonald somehow, and… Just read the link.\n\nI was in a group looking at some data regarding Michigan’s charter schools when someone recollected that charters were supposed to be educational trailblazers, and that’s why they were freed from many of the constraints traditional schools have — so they could run ahead and blaze a trail.\n\nNot so much anymore. Not in New York, anyway:\n\nA primary rationale for the creation of charter schools, which are publicly financed and privately run, was to develop test kitchens for practices that could be exported into the traditional schools. President Obama, in recently proclaiming “National Charter Schools Week,” said they “can provide effective approaches for the broader public education system.” But two decades since the schools began to appear, educators from both systems concede that very little of what has worked for charter schools has found its way into regular classrooms. Testy political battles over space and money, including one that became glaringly public in New York State this spring, have inhibited attempts at collaboration. The sharing of school buildings, which in theory should foster communication, has more frequently led to conflict. And some charter schools have veered so sharply from the traditional model — with longer school years, armies of nonunion workers and flashy enrichment opportunities like trips to the Galápagos Islands — that their ideas are viewed as unworkable in regular schools.\n\nFinally, I know Christopher Columbus long ago lost his luster with most people, but I was raised in Columbus, Ohio, and I will always read a story about the old Genoan. And this one is pretty interesting; scientists think they might have found the wreckage of the Santa Maria.\n\nA lot for a Wednesday, I know, but hey — eat up.",

enough to interest the government you are missing the point if youre in this camp greenwald urges of course dutiful loyal supporters of the president and his policies good citizens who do nothing to attract negative attention from the powerful have no reason to fear the surveillance state this is the case in every society those who pose no challenge are rarely targeted by oppressive measures and from their perspective they can then convince themselves that oppression does not really exist but the true measure of a societys freedom is how it treats its dissidents and other marginalized groups not how it treats good loyalists we shouldnt have to be faithful loyalists of the powerful to feel safe from state surveillance nor should the price of immunity be refraining from controversial or provocative dissent we shouldnt want a society where the message is conveyed that you will be left alone only if you mimic the accommodating behavior and conventional wisdom of a washington

else im supposed to read someone recently recommended hellhound on his trail the story of the manhunt for james earl ray describing how great it was etc and all i could think was dammit another one more fiery oratory from gene weingarten speaking at joe mcginniss memorial service listen when a writer enters into an agreement with a source to tell his story there is always an accompanying covenant this will be acknowledged by you know every journalist who is not too stupid or full of himself to notice what is going on in return for fair and objective reporting the subject is promising to tell the truth if the subject lies to the writer all bets are off the degree to which this principle attaches is directly proportional to the enormity of the lie that was told hes speaking of the teapot tempest that followed a new yorker piece that was about fatal vision called the journalist and the murderer the writer janet malcolm implied that mcginniss had betrayed jeffrey macdonald somehow and just read the link i was in a group looking at some data regarding michigans charter schools when someone recollected that charters were supposed to be educational trailblazers and thats why they were freed from many of the constraints traditional schools have — so they could run ahead and blaze a trail not so much anymore not in new york anyway a primary rationale for the creation of charter schools which are publicly financed and privately run was to develop test kitchens for practices that could be exported into the traditional schools president obama in recently proclaiming national charter schools week said they can provide effective approaches for the broader public education system but two decades since the schools began to appear educators from both systems concede that very little of what has worked for charter schools has found its way into regular classrooms testy political battles over space and money including one that became glaringly public in new york state this spring have inhibited attempts at collaboration the sharing of school buildings which in theory should foster communication has more frequently led to conflict and some charter schools have veered so sharply from the traditional model — with longer school years armies of nonunion workers and flashy enrichment opportunities like trips to the galápagos islands — that their ideas are viewed as unworkable in regular schools finally i know christopher columbus long ago lost his luster with most people but i was raised in columbus ohio and i will always read a story about the old genoan and

We shouldn’t want a society where the message is conveyed that you will be left alone only if you mimic the accommodating behavior and conventional wisdom of a Washington establishment columnist. …Reading about all the disclosures again, woven together and in context, I couldn’t decide which was worse: the NSA’s massive, grim overreach, in the hands of Director Michael Hayden—or the complicity of almost every other entity involved, private as well as public. “PRISM is a team sport!” trumpeted one NSA memo. Too true: Other memos and slides show Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Microsoft easing the way toward surveillance of their users. (Twitter was the exception in this case.) When the Guardian and the Washington Post broke that news, the tech companies tried to argue otherwise based on a technicality. But looking back, the documents “give the lie to Silicon Valley’s denials of cooperation,” as Greenwald writes.\n\nI will be reading this, most likely. Eventually. After I read everything else I’m supposed to read. Someone recently recommended “Hellhound on His Trail,” the story of the manhunt for James Earl Ray, describing how great it was, etc., and all I could think was, dammit, another one.\n\nMore fiery oratory, from Gene Weingarten, speaking at Joe McGinniss’ memorial service:\n\nWhen a writer enters into an agreement with a source to tell his story, there is always an accompanying covenant. This will be acknowledged by, you know, every journalist who is not too stupid or full of himself to notice what is going on. In return for fair and objective reporting, the subject is promising to tell the truth. If the subject lies to the writer, all bets are off. The degree to which this principle attaches is directly proportional to the enormity of the lie that was told.\n\nHe’s speaking of the teapot tempest that followed a New Yorker piece that was about “Fatal Vision,” called “The Journalist and the Murderer.” The writer, Janet Malcolm, implied that McGinniss had betrayed Jeffrey MacDonald somehow, and… Just read the link.\n\nI was in a group looking at some data regarding Michigan’s charter schools when someone recollected that charters were supposed to be educational trailblazers, and that’s why they were freed from many of the constraints traditional schools have — so they could run ahead and blaze a trail.\n\nNot so much anymore. Not in New York, anyway:\n\nA primary rationale for the creation of charter schools, which are publicly financed and privately run, was to develop test kitchens for practices that could be exported into the traditional schools. President Obama, in recently proclaiming “National Charter Schools Week,” said they “can provide effective approaches for the broader public education system.” But two decades since the schools began to appear, educators from both systems concede that very little of what has worked for charter schools has found its way into regular classrooms. Testy political battles over space and money, including one that became glaringly public in New York State this spring, have inhibited attempts at collaboration. The sharing of school buildings, which in theory should foster communication, has more frequently led to conflict. And some charter schools have veered so sharply from the traditional model — with longer school years, armies of nonunion workers and flashy enrichment opportunities like trips to the Galápagos Islands — that their ideas are viewed as unworkable in regular schools.\n\nFinally, I know Christopher Columbus long ago lost his luster with most people, but I was raised in Columbus, Ohio, and I will always read a story about the old Genoan. And this one is pretty interesting; scientists think they might have found the wreckage of the Santa Maria.\n\nA lot for a Wednesday, I know, but hey — eat up.",

And roughly since his 18th birthday, on Dec. 2, he's been in and out of the hospital three times due to a twice-collapsed right lung -- once from a physical therapy session gone awry, a second time from a bad wreck during a halfpipe practice run that also left him with two fractured ribs.

Instead, it has left him feeling anxious and uncertain and, frankly, kind of bummed out, he says.\n\n\"A lot of hectic stress and craziness going on around this one event, I just can't wait for it to be done.

Hopefully soon at least I'll know when I can ski again.\"\n\nStace Yater-Wallace, Torin's mom, recognized some extraordinary qualities in her son early on.\n\n\"Did I think he'd go to the Olympics or X Games? Absolutely. Did I know when? Absolutely not. I always figured it'd take a few more years. It's all been pretty amazing,\" she said.\n\nYater-Wallace joined the Aspen Valley Ski & Snowboard Club when he was seven. Soon, Yater-Wallace, Mikey Schumacher and Alex Ferreira -- the other halfpipe skier from Aspen on the U.S. Freeskiing team -- became an inseparable trio, best friends to this day. The coaches called them \"ATM,\" for Alex, Torin and Mikey, and by all accounts they skied more than your average ski-town youngsters. Quite a lot more.\n\nAfter the chairlifts would stop running and Team ATM had to leave the club, they would often shift over to Alex or Mikey's yards nearby, where they'd work on building new jumps or rails to hit over and over again. This activity would sometimes go well into the night, because, as ATM knew well, rounding up surplus construction-site lighting is a cinch here in Glitter Gulch.\n\n\"There were people I went to school with who wouldn't ski on the weekend -- that was just a crazy concept to me,\" Yater-Wallace said. \"To me, Aspen is all about skiing and from a young age I was into it. I was always trying to ski.\"\n\n\"They were extremely motivated,\" said Eric Knight, a longtime coach at Aspen Valley Ski & Snowboard Club, referring to ATM. \"I mean, they were doing this all day every day, but they weren't burning out because these were three best friends.

Everything wasn't always as it should've been. He was not the richest kid and he always had to work for what he had,\" Schumacher said. \"But with skiing, it was that perfect place for him, the one he wanted and the one he dreamed about. So now, when he's on the hill, he's still in that perfect place. He's not thinking about who's watching or what's at stake. No, he's thinking that this is what he loves to do and where he's happiest.\"\n\nYater-Wallace, for his part, would seem to agree.\n\n\"I guess the uniqueness of my skiing comes with the way I think about skiing,\" he said. \"I hate being a follower, just a mimic of somebody else, and I hate the aspect of being a jock in a sport like this.\"\n\nYater-Wallace was cleared to ski again just before X Games Aspen 2014, and although he qualified for the finals, he pulled out just prior to the competition due to his injuries.\n\nFor now, though, he is just happy to be back doing what he loves.\n\n\"It's freeskiing, you know.

country who come to visit and see how it is done however lurking behind the immersion grandeur are a significant number of frustrated parents issues of segregation nonimmersion students being pushed aside nonimmersion classes with too many learning disabilities weighing down teachers and immersion programs getting treated to extra grant money the biggest concern for kristie kearns a fourthgrade parent at morgan elementary in kaysville is the division between immersion and nonimmersion students this is the closest thing to segregation ive seen since the 50s because at a normal school when you

Dave Crandall, board chairman, said he expects hiring such a company may cost tens of thousands of dollars. The board hopes to use a search firm in addition to putting out its own announcement.\n\n “We wanted to cast a broader net and really actually go after individuals who may not actively be seeking a new job,” Crandall said.\n\n http://go.uen.org/110  (SLT)\n\n‘Making the Grade:’ Controversial changes come to Ogden Schools\n\nFor years, the Ogden School District was seen as one of the worst districts in the state. Schools in the district had some of the lowest test scores in the state and graduation rates were decreasing.\n\n Ogden, where the public schools have the highest poverty rates in the state, has been hit especially hard by shrinking education budgets and outside pressures.\n\n In 2011, the district’s school board appointed Brad Smith, a Northern Utah lawyer, as the new superintendent. The decision proved controversial.\n\n Two years later, criticism of the district spiked. A series of layoffs were announced as a means to address a multi-million dollar budget shortfall and teachers left the district in record numbers.\n\n Despite the backlash, graduation rates in the district are on the rise and new programs have been started to build leadership and improve relationships between parents, teachers, and administrators.\n\n http://go.uen.org/115  (OSE)\n\nWill Salt Lake City shrink class sizes?\n\n District wouldn’t need to raise taxes to make it happen.\n\n…\n\n The Salt Lake City School District is looking at possibilities that include lowering student-teacher ratios across the district, or just in the fourth through sixth grades.\n\n The district wouldn’t need to raise taxes to pay for the changes, but it would likely have to forgo lowering them. It’s a price many educators and parents hope taxpayers are willing to bear.\n\n http://go.uen.org/111  (SLT)\n\nFor the last eight years, 11 elementary schools of 60 in Davis School District, four in Weber School District, and two in Ogden School District have incorporated dual immersion programs with Spanish, Chinese, or French. To many, it is one of the highlights of the school’s education system, with experts from across the country who come to visit and see how it is done.\n\n However, lurking behind the immersion grandeur are a significant number of frustrated parents. Issues of segregation, non-immersion students being pushed aside, non-immersion classes with too many learning disabilities weighing down teachers, and immersion programs getting treated to extra grant money.\n\n The biggest concern for Kristie Kearns, a fourth-grade parent at Morgan Elementary in Kaysville, is the division between immersion and non-immersion students. “This is the closest thing to segregation I’ve seen since the ’50s because at a normal school, when you volunteer in class or go on field trips, you get to know other moms and their kids, but at an immersion school, we can only get to know half the school,” said Kearns, who says it also extends to the kids because the immersion students and the rest don’t interact with one another during lunch or recess.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11j (OSE)\n\nPush for partisan school board elections shaky Utah Republican Party split in approach to direct elections\n\nSchool Board candidates in Utah run in nonpartisan elections. However, attempts were made to change that during the General Session of the 2014 Utah State Legislature. Three separate bills were introduced to change the current process of electing state school board members, and while they failed to be signed into law, a resolution calling for partisan local school board elections has been passed.\n\n Republican Oak Norton sponsored the resolution, which was passed by GOP state delegates at the Utah Republican Convention on Saturday, April 26. Norton is the executive director of Agency Based Education, and the resolution urges legislators to reintroduce legislation to establish partisan school board elections at both the state and local levels..\n\n Park City School District Board of Education President Maurice “Moe” Hickey said he believes changing the process for electing school board members to include political parties will prove detrimental.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11M  (PR)\n\nIn a unanimous vote Wednesday, the North Sanpete Board of Education selected Dr. Samuel L. Ray to be the next superintendent of the North Sanpete School District. Dr. Ray comes from the Provo School District, where he has served as an assistant principle, middle school principal, high school principal and district director. Dr. Ray earned a Master’s Degree in Educational Leadership from BYU, and a Doctor of Education degree in Curriculum and Instruction from Utah State University. The search for a new superintendent began after current Superintendent Leslie Keisel announced her retirement earlier this year. Dr. Ray will take office July 1.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11D  (MUR)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY – In a ceremony Thursday, officials from the Bureau of Land Management, Utah state government and the State of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration signed a document recognizing the completion of an equal value land exchange that enhances recreational and conservation values on federal lands while opening lands now in state ownership to mineral development opportunities.

HB286 allows elementary schools to instruct parents and kids on preventing child sexual abuse. It was pushed by kidnap victim Elizabeth Smart and abuse victim Deondra Brown, of the Five Browns piano group.\n\n SB122 creates an education bill of rights saying that parents are the people primarily in charge of their children’s education, and schools “shall reasonably accommodate” their requests for special or advanced education, absences, advancing early, remaining in a grade or skipping year-end assessment tests.\n\n HB96 would provide $3 million to set up a grant program for schools and families to implement high-quality preschool curriculum for at-risk kids.

STEM education may be a good thing. But it is far from being good enough in today’s world.\n\n STEM will not correct the ignorance of young Cliven Bundy wannabes. STEM will not elect lawmakers more interested in solving problems than in creating them. STEM will not produce leaders who care about the disadvantaged. STEM will not save the education system from misguided meddling. STEM will not prevent our universities from elitism. STEM will not teach young adults to be better parents. STEM will not rescue Ukraine. STEM will not make prejudice disappear.\n\n http://go.uen.org/119\n\nWhy STEM Education\n\n Utah PoliticoHub commentary by STAN LOCKHART, private sector chair for Utah’s STEM Education Initiative\n\nDuring the last few months, television ads have popped up all over showing cool jobs in cool companies with the tag line “STEM Utah, Curiosity Unleashed”.\n\n Why would businesses fund a $2.5 million media campaign promoting Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM)?\n\n The world of today is very different than previous generations and is full of technological advances that make our lives more and more productive. STEM education produces critical thinkers and problems solvers. These are the very skills that allow our children to compete for today’s jobs. National studies show there are three STEM jobs for each qualified worker. Conversely, there are at least three applicants for each non-STEM job.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11w\n\nSupporting Strong Candidates for Political Office Utah Policy commentary by Utah State Board of Education Member Kim Burningham\n\nThe election season is upon us. Neighborhood caucuses and state political conventions have ended. Next up, primaries will narrow the candidates appearing on the November election ballot. Although the primary is officially scheduled in late June, mail-in ballots will be arriving at your home any day. I urge you to get involved.\n\n Previously, I have emphasized how additional funding for education is vital; such funding increase, however, must come by Legislative action and be supported by local school board candidates. The commitment of elected politicians is essential, and to make sure we have the best possible officeholders, you need to act to make sure quality people are elected.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11O\n\nSo Mr. Steve Green of Hobby Lobby wants high schools to “teach the Bible” in Oklahoma and in thousands of schools by 2017. By the way, he adheres to a literal reading of the text. (“Hobby Lobby boss persuades school district to incorporate Bible into its curriculum,” Tribune, May 8.)\n\n If the Bible course required students to actually read every word of the text, and not skip over and/or cherry pick the parts that each religious sect uses for their particular form of adherence, then any normal, decent person would discover the morally reprehensible actions of God and chosen peoples/tribes alike.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11a\n\nTeach kids to think for selves\n\n (Logan) Herald Journal letter from Paul Jamison\n\nRegarding Kenneth Wright’s Soapbox opinion in Friday’s HJ titled “Parents must counterbalance atheistic science education.” As a science educator I feel compelled to respond.\n\n First, I agree with Mr. Wright on the point that public science education is “atheistic.” If this were not so, we would first need to decide which version of theism we were going to incorporate into science classrooms, and this gets very messy. God and religion belong in the science classroom no more than chemistry and physics should be taught in church. Because God and religion are matters of faith, they are, by definition, outside the realm of science. Science cannot address these questions and does not try. I cannot help but wonder why the reverse is not true in that religions seem to be constantly attacking science.\n\n What Mr. Wright misses, I believe, is that it does not follow directly from the above that God and science are mutually exclusive.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11r\n\nBetter ways to help others\n\n (Provo) Daily Herald letter from Bonnie H. Christensen\n\nGood people can have different points of view about appropriate activities that involve and motivate young people in worthwhile projects. In recent years it has become very popular to ask teachers and school administrators to be “good sports” and subject themselves to kissing pigs, having syrup poured over their heads or eating worms or having pies smashed in their faces.\n\n As your paper reported recently (“Teachers complete dares to raise money for student with cancer,” May 7), these activities are enthusiastically endorsed by students who “hooted and hollered with delight.” As a parent and grandparent who respects those who have chosen to teach and mentor children with the goal of helping them become educated, responsible adults, I inwardly cringe at the disrespect that is being shown and, unfortunately, fostered.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11o\n\nThank you for the editorial about the outrageous kidnappings of young schoolgirls in Nigeria (“Why the Nigerian kidnapping matters,” May 9).

Together the Education and Justice departments have issued guidelines to ensure that school districts are in compliance with federal law. Attempts to exclude immigrants from our schools, Holder said, “weaken our nation … by leaving young people unprepared and ill-equipped to succeed and contribute to what is, in many cases, the only home they have ever known.”\n\n According to the Department of Homeland Security, there are 1.1 million undocumented children under 18 living in the U.S., while a 2011 Pew Research Center report found there were 4.5 million U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants.\n\n The announcement is welcome news for the Latino community. Not only do undocumented children have a right to a public education thanks to the 1982 Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe, it is smart public policy as well.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11K\n\nThe Benefits of Mixing Rich and Poor\n\n New York Times op-ed by DAVID L. KIRP, a professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley\n\nWhenever President Obama proposes a major federal investment in early education, as he did in his two most recent State of the Union addresses, critics have a two-word riposte: Head Start. Researchers have long cast doubt on that program’s effectiveness. The most damning evidence comes from a 2012 federal evaluation that used gold-standard methodology and concluded that children who participated in Head Start were not more successful in elementary school than others. That finding was catnip to the detractors. “Head Start’s impact is no better than random,” The Wall Street Journal editorialized. Why throw good money after bad?\n\n Though the faultfinders have a point, the claim that Head Start has failed overstates the case. For one thing, it has gotten considerably better in the past few years because of tougher quality standards. For another, researchers have identified a “sleeper effect” — many Head Start youngsters begin to flourish as teenagers, maybe because the program emphasizes character and social skills as well as the three R’s. Still, few would give Head Start high marks, and the bleak conclusion of the 2012 evaluation stands in sharp contrast to the impressive results from well-devised studies of state-funded prekindergartens.\n\n http://go.uen.org/116\n\nDept. of Education erects obstacles to keep states in Common Core\n\n Human Events op-ed by David Craig , a candidate for Governor of Maryland\n\nWhen someone hears bureaucratic terms like “compliance, mandates and penalties,” they might think of the EPA, the IRS, or these days, the Department of Health and Human Services. But another federal government department is fast adopting the language of strict and onerous regulation. Annoyed that Indiana wants to extricate themselves from the Common Core education standards, the U.S. Department of Education is erecting procedural obstacles to make this as difficult possible.\n\n At stake for Hoosiers is $200 million in federal education funds. The Obama Administration is using “No Child Left Behind” waivers to warn Indiana officials of the penalties they face for non-compliance with Common Core. In a political scheme that could only be hatched in Washington, one federal program enacted under George W. Bush and widely derided for undermining local school authority, is pitted against another federal program even more derided for the same reasons.\n\n Horror stories about Common Core are increasing by the day. Police are ejecting or arresting parents from public venues for voicing opposition to Common Core. Social media depicts test questions that make young pupils burst into tears, because they are impossible to answer and make them feel like failures. Meanwhile, elected officials like me are concerned about yet another federal government mandate that dangles $4 billion in federal Race to the Top education grants for local schools under the condition of adherence to Common Core.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11N\n\nMy kids are taking a school sabbatical\n\n CNN commentary by columnist Kristin Hussey\n\nA couple years ago, my husband and I realized that our family had moved out of the baby stage. The labor-intensive work of the early parenting years was behind us. Suddenly we were hurtling toward middle school and our home life was revving up.\n\n With work, school and the usual activities of suburban family life, all five of us were giving our best everywhere else. By the end of the day, we didn’t have much left for each other. I wanted to slow it all down.\n\n I pitched an idea to my husband, Alex: For one school semester, from January to June, we’d take a family sabbatical. Our children are 11, 8 and nearly 5 years old — old enough to carry their own backpacks, but not so old that they don’t want to hang with us anymore. We decided to hit the pause button on everyday life and do something memorable as a family.\n\n As we worked out the logistics, we decided on two main goals: We wanted our children to spend time with their grandparents, and we wanted to travel around the United States. My husband couldn’t take six months off from work, but we could plan a trip that would allow Alex to spend the workweek at home and meet up for long weekends.\n\n I talked with the principal of our boys’ public elementary school about our plan and she didn’t tell me it was a bad idea.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11S\n\nCharters, Public Schools and a Chasm Between New York Times\n\nWhen Neil J. McNeill Jr., principal of the Middle School for Art and Philosophy in Brooklyn, learned that fewer than 4 percent of his students had passed state exams in math last year, he was frustrated.\n\n It so happened that he shared a building with one of the top- performing schools in the Brownsville neighborhood, Kings Collegiate Charter School, where 37 percent of the students had passed, well above the New York City middle-school average of 27 percent.\n\n Mr. McNeill had long been curious about the charter school’s strategies: It, too, served large numbers of low-income black students, many from the same neighborhoods. But the two schools operated in their own bubbles, with separate public-address systems and different textbooks. And as a matter of practice, they did not talk about academics.\n\n “We are kind of two ships in the night,” Mr. McNeill, 39, said recently.\n\n A primary rationale for the creation of charter schools, which are publicly financed and privately run, was to develop test kitchens for practices that could be exported into the traditional schools. President Obama, in recently proclaiming “National Charter Schools Week,” said they “can provide effective approaches for the broader public education system.”\n\n But two decades since the schools began to appear, educators from both systems concede that very little of what has worked for charter schools has found its way into regular classrooms.

Since December, 20,000 teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade have introduced coding lessons, according to Code.org, a group backed by the tech industry that offers free curriculums. In addition, some 30 school districts, including New York City and Chicago, have agreed to add coding classes in the fall, mainly in high schools but in lower grades, too. And policy makers in nine states have begun awarding the same credits for computer science classes that they do for basic math and science courses, rather than treating them as electives.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11E\n\nWhy Aren’t Teens Reading Like They Used To?\n\n NPR Morning Edition\n\nHarry Potter and The Hunger Games haven’t been big hits for nothing. Lots of teens and adolescents still read quite a lot.\n\n But a roundup of studies, put together by the nonprofit Common Sense Media, shows a clear decline over time. Nearly half of 17-year-olds say they read for pleasure no more than one or two times a year — if that.\n\n That’s way down from a decade ago.\n\n The digital revolution means there are more platforms than ever to read on. And yet, the number of American teens reading for pleasure has dropped dramatically. Researchers are asking if there’s a link.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11C\n\nComprehension may suffer when students read on the digital devices now flooding into classrooms, an emerging body of research suggests.\n\n In response, some academics, educators, and technology vendors are pushing to minimize the distracting bells and whistles that abound in high-tech instructional materials. They’re also trying to figure out how best to help students transfer tried-and-true print reading strategies into new digital learning environments.\n\n “We have to move into the 21st century, but we should do so with great care to build a ‘bi-literate’ brain that has the circuitry for ‘deep reading’ skills, and at the same time is adept with technology,” said Maryanne Wolf, the director of the Center for Reading and Language Research at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11G\n\nAsian-Americans Are Successful, But No Thanks To Tiger Parenting NPR Tell Me More\n\nContrary to popular stereotypes, Asian-Americans don’t achieve academic success just because it’s just in their genes.

Most countries put a premium on feeding school children a healthy meal at lunchtime.\n\n Many kids go home to eat lunch with their families or bring a lunch cooked by their parents.\n\n Although few schools sell lunch, snacks are available around the world. In many places those snacks are as unhealthy as treats in the United States: fried doughnuts in Mali and Pakistan, candy in the West Bank, fried chicken nuggets in France.\n\n American children are more likely to eat a lunch made in a school cafeteria, although other countries are starting to adopt this practice as more mothers go to work outside the home.\n\n http://go.uen.org/117\n\nA Lesson in Farming, Classroom to Cafeteria New York Times\n\nHAGERSTOWN, Ind. — Beyond a stack of hay bales, past the site of Indiana’s first soil-judging contest, high school students in this tiny eastern town stroll down a grassy slope to reach their newest classroom: a fenced-in field of cud-chewing cattle.\n\n Starting in the next academic year, the cattle, which arrived last month and have names like Ground Round and Honey Bear, will be fed by students enrolled in an agricultural science class. Then, when the animals are fat enough, they will be fed back to their caretakers — as beef patties on lunchroom trays.\n\n Hagerstown, population 1,769, is like many rural communities confronting the cost of population decline and concerns that local agricultural ties are disappearing. Small-town schools across the country are turning to hands-on agricultural classes that also supply cheaper, healthier food for their cafeterias.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11F\n\nMassachusetts: Pledge of Allegiance not Religious Associated Press\n\nBOSTON — The Pledge of Allegiance does not discriminate against atheists and can be recited at the start of the day in public schools, Massachusetts’ highest court ruled Friday.\n\n The Supreme Judicial Court said the words “under God” in the pledge reflect patriotic practice, not a religious one. They acknowledged that the wording has a “religious tinge” but said it is fundamentally patriotic and voluntary.\n\n The court was ruling in a 2010 lawsuit filed by an atheist family from Acton who claimed that the daily recitation of the pledge in classrooms violated their three children’s equal protection rights under the state constitution, which protects against discrimination. The family was not identified in the lawsuit.\n\n http://go.uen.org/11H\n\nTwo students solve the case of the watery ketchup by designing a new cap (Kansas City, MO) KCPT via NewsHour\n\nNorth Liberty High School seniors Tyler Richards, left, and Jonathan Thompson used a 3-D printer to create a new cap that prevents watery ketchup squirts and eliminates the need to shake the bottle.
