            "text": "On Wednesday, the Kremlin ordered surprise military exercises in a western region of Russia bordering Ukraine and put troops in the area on high alert. The move, which Russia insists were routine, comes as ethnic Russians in the Crimean Peninsula push back against the pro-Western protests that forced out the country’s president and toppled the government.\n\nIn Crimea’s capital, Simferopol, pro-Russia demonstrators confronted pro-Western ones, leaving at least one person dead—an elderly man who died of a heart attack at the rival demonstrations outside local government buildings. “Crimea was Russian territory until the Soviet Union ceded it to the Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine in 1954,” The New York Times reports, “and Russians there have already pleaded for the Kremlin’s intervention to protect the region from Ukraine’s new leadership.” Crimea is already an autonomous region within Ukraine and has more self-governance powers than other regions in the country\n\nAs Lucian Kim at BuzzFeed phrased it:\n\nBy conducting military exercises close to Ukraine’s border, Putin is giving the finger to the interim government and its western allies, without facing any consequences. The Kremlin understands perfectly well that keeping a naval base in Crimea is much more useful than annexing the entire peninsula, since it is Ukraine’s most vulnerable part.\n\nThe military exercises are set to begin Friday and last until March 3. They are also expected to involve the Russian naval fleet stationed in the Crimean port of Sevastopol. According to The Washington Post, “Sevastopol looks, sounds and feels like a little corner of Russia, and activists here have declared that it will remain that way, no matter what happens in the rest of Ukraine.”\n\nOn Thursday morning, armed men seized the parliament building in Crimea. It is unclear who they are affiliated with or what their goals are.",

definition of naturalborn is the 1898 us supreme courts decision in us v wong kim ark 169 us 649 in that case the court confirmed that wong kim ark a child of chinese nationals born in the city of san francisco was a naturalborn united states citizen the courts reasoning was that since the term naturalborn was specifically used in the united states constitution which was written in 1787 english common law was to be used in its interpretation of naturalborn the court explained the interpretation of the constitution of the united states is necessarily influenced by the fact that its provisions are framed in the language of the english common law and are to be read in the light of its history the court further explained the fundamental principle of the common law with regard to english nationality was birth within the allegiance also called ligealty obedience faith or power of the king the principle embraced all persons born within the kings allegiance and subject to his protection such allegiance and protection were mutual — as expressed in the maxim protectio trahit subjectionem et subjectio protectionem – and were not restricted to naturalborn subjects and naturalized subjects or to those who had taken an oath of allegiance but were predicable of aliens in amity so long as they were within the kingdom children born in england of such aliens were therefore

his mother was a us citizen when she gave birth to obama in the hawaiian kingdom he can not however claim hawaiian citizenship by birth because the international law of occupation which protects and

            "text": "Putting aside the violence that has caused injuries and death in Ukraine on both the government and protesters side, what does the law say regarding the removal of Ukraine’s President Victor Yanukovych by vote of the Ukrainian Parliament (Rada). In The Daily Beast article “How Ukraine’s Parliament Brought Down Yanukovych,” there was no mention of Ukrainian law, except for legislation passed by the Rada. The Daily Beast reported, “after Yanukovych refused to leave office, the Ukrainian parliament by an overwhelming majority voted to remove him from the post as the one who ‘has dissociated himself’ by fleeing the capital. The ballot was passed with a constitutional majority and entered into force immediately.”\n\nPresident Obama calls the new government legitimate, but President Putin calls it illegitimate. According to Article 108 of the Ukrainian Constitution, “The authority of the President of Ukraine shall be subject to an early termination in cases of: (1) resignation; (2) inability to exercise presidential authority for health reasons; (3) removal from office by the procedure of impeachment; (4) his/her death.” Since Yanukovych didn’t resign and he had no health issues, the only way to remove him would be “by the procedure of impeachment.” The quintessential question is whether a vote of removal by the Rada constituted impeachment. If it was then Yanukovych is no longer President, but if not then the Rada vote was unconstitutional and Yanukovych is still President even while he is in Russia.\n\nBy definition, impeachment is not removal, but rather a process initiated by a legislative body in order to remove a President. Impeachment is similar to an indictment, which precedes a trial. Under the United States Constitution this two-step process begins when the House of Representatives votes for articles of impeachment by a majority of those Representatives present, which provides the allegations of “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” If the articles of impeachment pass, the President is considered impeached. What follows is for the Senate to hold a trial, which is presided over by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1999, President Bill Clinton was impeached, but was found not guilty in the Senate trial.\n\nThe Ukrainian Constitution provides for the process of impeaching its President.\n\n“Article 111. The President of Ukraine may be removed from the office by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine in compliance with a procedure of impeachment if he commits treason or other crime.\n\nThe issue of the removal of the President of Ukraine from the office in compliance with a procedure of impeachment shall be initiated by the majority of the constitutional membership of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.\n\nThe Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine shall establish a special ad hoc investigating commission, composed of special prosecutor and special investigators to conduct an investigation.\n\nThe conclusions and proposals of the ad hoc investigating commission shall be considered at the meeting of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine.\n\nOn the ground of evidence, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine shall, by at least two-thirds of its constitutional membership, adopt a decision to bring charges against the President of Ukraine.\n\nThe decision on the removal of the President of Ukraine from the office in compliance with the procedure of impeachment shall be adopted by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine by at least three-quarters of its constitutional membership upon a review of the case by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and receipt of its opinion on the observance of the constitutional procedure of investigation and consideration of the case of impeachment, and upon a receipt of the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ukraine to the effect that the acts, of which the President of Ukraine is accused, contain elements of treason or other crime.”\n\nThe Rada’s vote to remove President Yanukovych does not appear to be following this constitutional process and it can be argued that Yanukovych’s removal was unconstitutional, which is what Russia has been stating. Russia also has stated that Yanukovych’s removal was supported by the United States, especially after a phone conversation between assistant U.S. Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, was leaked to the media. On February 7, 2014, The Guardian reported on the phone conversation and played the audio.\n\nWith the world’s focus on whether Yanukovych is still President according to Ukrainian law and not international law, there is a question of Presidential legitimacy the world may not know, which is the legitimacy of United States President Barrack Obama under United States law. Article II of the United States Constitution provides, “No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President.” The term natural born (jus soli) is a person who acquires United States citizenship through birth on United States territory. This is different from U.S. citizenship acquired through naturalization, which has a residency requirement, and U.S. citizenship acquired through parentage (jus sanguinis) when born outside of the United States.\n\nThe leading case in the United States on the definition of “natural-born” is the 1898 U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649. In that case, the Court confirmed that Wong Kim Ark, a child of Chinese nationals born in the city of San Francisco, was a natural-born United States citizen. The Court’s reasoning was that since the term “natural-born” was specifically used in the United States Constitution, which was written in 1787, English common law was to be used in its interpretation of natural-born. The Court explained, “The interpretation of the Constitution of the United States is necessarily influenced by the fact that its provisions are framed in the language of the English common law, and are to be read in the light of its history.”\n\nThe Court further explained, “The fundamental principle of the common law with regard to English nationality was birth within the allegiance, also called ‘ligealty,’ ‘obedience,’ ‘faith,’ or ‘power’ of the King. The principle embraced all persons born within the King’s allegiance and subject to his protection. Such allegiance and protection were mutual — as expressed in the maxim protectio trahit subjectionem, et subjectio protectionem – and were not restricted to natural-born subjects and naturalized subjects, or to those who had taken an oath of allegiance, but were predicable of aliens in amity so long as they were within the kingdom. Children, born in England, of such aliens were therefore natural-born subjects. But the children, born within the realm, of foreign ambassadors, or the children of alien enemies, born during and within their hostile occupation of part of the King’s dominions, were not natural-born subjects because not born within the allegiance, the obedience, or the power, or, as would be said at this day, within the jurisdiction, of the King.”\n\nTwo of the Judges, however, dissented with the judgment on racial grounds, but they also allude to what it meant to children born abroad of U.S. parents. Both judges stated, “Considering the circumstances surrounding the framing of the Constitution, I submit that it is unreasonable to conclude that ‘natural-born citizen’ applied to everybody born within the geographical tract known as the United States, …while children of our citizens, born abroad, were not.”\n\nObama was born in the Hawaiian Kingdom and not the United States. He was born in the city of Honolulu on August 4, 1961 at Kapi‘olani Hospital, which was established in 1890 by the Hawaiian Kingdom’s Queen Kapi‘olani.\n\nSince the Hawaiian Kingdom has been under an illegal and prolonged occupation by the United States and its continuity is protected under international law, Obama cannot claim to be a natural-born citizen of the United States and, therefore, cannot meet the constitutional requirement to be a President of the United States. But he is a U.S. citizen through parentage (jus sanguinis) because his mother was a U.S. citizen when she gave birth to Obama in the Hawaiian Kingdom. He cannot, however, claim Hawaiian citizenship by birth because the international law of occupation, which protects and maintains the status quo of the occupied State, only allows Hawaiian citizenship through parentage and not natural-born even though it is a recognized mode of acquiring citizenship under Hawaiian Kingdom law.",

The Associated Press said dozens of the armed men continued to patrol the airport and they refused to speak to media. AFP said representatives from the new leadership in Kiev had been due to arrive at the airport on Friday.\n\nIn Sevastopol armed men were reported to have set up a perimeter around the city's combined military-civilian airport, known as Belbek, on Friday morning. The Interfax news agency described them as Russian servicemen who said they had gone to Belbek to stop \"fighters\" flying in.\n\nOn Thursday morning in Simferopol men dressed in fatigues stormed Crimea's administration, hoisting a Russian flag above the parliament building. About 120 men were holed up inside armed with heavy weapons including rocket-propelled grenades and sniper rifles, witnesses said.\n\nWith gunmen controlling the building, Crimea's parliament voted to hold a referendum on the region's status on 25 May, the same day Ukraine goes to the polls in presidential elections. It also voted to sack the region's cabinet. The move puts the predominantly ethnic-Russian region on a collision course with Kiev's interim government and will fuel concern Ukraine is sliding inexorably towards break-up.\n\nIt was unclear whether the gunmen were undercover Russian soldiers or members of a pro-Russian self-defence militia formed in response to Ukraine's revolution, which has included radical nationalist groups. The former head of the Crimean parliament, Serhiy Kunitsyn, described the men as professionally trained and armed with enough weaponry to defend the complex for a month.\n\nLate on Thursday the US vice-president, Joe Biden, spoke with Ukraine's interim prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk. Biden promised Ukraine's new leadership the full support of the US, a White House statement said.\n\nRussia's ousted ally Viktor Yanukovych, the former Ukraine president, who fled Kiev last week after his troops shot dead more than 80 people, resurfaced on Thursday to insist he was still the country's legitimate leader – excoriating Ukraine's new leadership as he did so.\n\nThat government confirmed 39-year-old former opposition leader Arseniy Yatsenyuk as acting prime minister, and gave two of the former regime's most prominent victims places in the new administration. Tetiana Chornovol, an investigative journalist beaten up by thugs, heads a new anti-corruption office. Activist Dmytro Bulatov, who was kidnapped and had part of his ear cut off, becomes Ukraine's youth minister.\n\nUkraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, who has been in the job since Yanukovych fled the country, warned Russia not to intervene in the crisis by moving troops. The Kremlin's Black Sea fleet is based near Simferopol in the port of Sevastopol. Turchynov said: \"I am appealing to the military leadership of the Russian Black Sea fleet. Any military movements, the more so if they are with weapons, beyond the boundaries of this territory [the base] will be seen by us as military aggression.\" Ukraine's foreign ministry also summoned Russia's acting envoy in Kiev for consultations.\n\nThe White House said it was closely watching Russian's military manoeuvres, ordered by Vladimir Putin next to Ukraine's border. Putin also put fighter jets on a state of high alert.\n\nThe US defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, called on the Kremlin to show restraint and reaffirmed Washington's commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\nAfter meeting Angela Merkel, David Cameron said he and the German chancellor were particularly concerned. Nato's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, urged Russia not to do anything that would escalate tension or create misunderstanding.\n\nPoland's foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, described the seizure of government buildings in the Crimea a \"very dangerous game\". He told a news conference: \"This is a drastic step, and I'm warning those who did this and those who allowed them to do this, because this is how regional conflicts begin.\"\n\nHours after the parliament building was seized, Yanukovych revealed he was in Russia and had sought protection from Putin. He said he would hold a press conference on Friday in Rostov-on-Don, close to Ukraine's border and his home city of Donetsk.\n\nHis unusual choice of a provincial press conference venue suggests he still nurtures hopes of a return to power, possibly as the leader of a breakaway Russian-backed enclave encompassing Crimea and eastern Ukraine.\n\nYanukovych appeared to give approval to secessionist pro-Russian forces in Crimea, and said an \"orgy of extremism\" had swept the country. \"Now it is becoming clear that the people in south-eastern Ukraine and in Crimea do not accept the power vacuum and complete lawlessness in the country,\" he said.\n\nIn Kiev, members of Ukraine's new government hinted that the country would sign an association agreement with the EU next month. It was Yanukovych's decision in December to dump the agreement – and instead accept a bailout from Russia – that prompted the street demonstrations that eventually led to his overthrow. Ukrainian officials branded the referendum decision by Crimea's parliament as unconstitutional.\n\nEarlier in Simferopol, the gunmen barricaded doors into the parliament building with wooden crates. Police sealed off the area on Thursday, as a crowd supportive of the seizure gathered outside. Two people died and 35 were injured during clashes outside the building on Wednesday between pro-Russian demonstrators and Muslim Tatars. About half of Crimea's 2 million population are ethnic Russians. The Tatars – the peninsula's original Turkic-speaking Muslim inhabitants – are 300,000 strong and support the authorities in Kiev.\n\nWitnesses described the moment when the armed men turned up. \"We were building barricades in the night to protect parliament. Then this young Russian guy came up with a pistol … we all lay down, some more ran up, there was some shooting and around 50 went in through the window,\" Leonid Khazanov, an ethnic Russian, told Reuters.\n\nKhazanov added: \"They're still there … Then the police came, they seemed scared. I asked them [the armed men] what they wanted, and they said: 'To make our own decisions, not to have Kiev telling us what to do'.\"\n\nThe former head of the central executive body of Crimean Tatars, Mustafa Jemilev, said the situation was extremely worrying. He suggested the gunmen had arrived from Sevastopol, where the Russian fleet is based. \"The people in camouflage and without any distinctive signs came by buses from the Sevastopol side. There are reports of movement of armed vehicles of the Russian fleet in different directions. We also got signs that in many hotels there are Russian soldiers wearing civilian clothes. The Russian general consul office says they have nothing to do with these events. But they would hardly tell the truth.\"\n\nJemilev speculated that the gunmen could be Russian soldiers or members of Berkut, the now-disbanded riot police unit deployed against opposition protesters in Kiev. Lifenews.ru, a pro-Kremlin Russian website with links to Russia's spy agencies, however, said they were veterans from the army and police. According to US diplomatic cables leaked in 2010 by Wikileaks, Russia's military intelligence wing – the GRU – is highly active in Crimea.\n\nAbout 100 police had gathered in front of the parliament building on Thursday. A similar number of people carrying Russian flags later marched up to the building chanting \"Russia, Russia\" and holding a sign calling for a Crimean referendum.\n\nMany wore orange-and-black striped ribbons that symbolise support for Russia. One of them, Alexei, 30, said: \"We have our own constitution, Crimea is autonomous. The government in Kiev are fascists, and what they're doing is illegal … We need to show our support for the guys inside [parliament]. Power should be ours.\"\n\n\"Yesterday Russian people were attacked and murdered by Tatar extremists. We will not allow this fascism from Kiev to happen here,\" said 43-year-old construction worker, Spartak. \"Crimea wants independence and we want parliament to hold a referendum on this. We have been hijacked.\"\n\nPolicemen informed passersby that Karl Marx Street was closed due to the presence of snipers in the areas. Nearby shops and businesses have closed and pulled down their shutters.\n\nThe acting interior minister, Arsen Avakov, who said the attackers had automatic weapons and machine guns, urged calm. He said on Facebook: \"Provocateurs are on the march. It is the time for cool heads.\"\n\nTurchynov, speaking to the parliament in Kiev, described the attackers as \"criminals in military fatigues with automatic weapons\".\n\nHe also called on Moscow not to violate the terms of an agreement that gives the Russian Black Sea fleet basing rights at Sevastopol until 2042.",

But I want to underscore to everybody that this is not 'Rocky 4'. It is not a zero-sum game,\" Kerry told a small group of reporters, including AFP.\n\n\"We have only one interest and that is for the people of Ukraine to be able to make their choice, and to choose the path that they want to go down and for the rest of us to respect that path.\"\n\nHe insisted the top priority for the interim Ukraine leadership that has taken over after the ouster of president Viktor Yanukovych was forming a new inclusive government, as he revealed that the United States was \"formulating initially a $1-billion loan guarantee with some other pieces\" in aid.\n\nThe European Union was also looking at offering $1.5-billion in loan guarantees to the former Soviet satellite, he said.\n\nThe top US diplomat warned Russia that \"any kind of military intervention that would violate the sovereignty, the territorial integrity, of Ukraine would be a grave mistake.\"\n\nAlthough he was reluctant to say what the international response would be to any such military steps, he hinted there could be moves to take any such intervention to the United Nations.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said earlier on Wednesday that Moscow was taking measures to ensure the security of its Black Sea naval fleet based on Ukraine's southern Crimean peninsula.\n\nSevastopol, which has hosted the Black Sea fleet since tsarist times, has witnessed several pro-Russian demonstrations in recent days with hundreds rallying outside city hall on Tuesday.\n\n\"For a country that has spoken out so frequently in the last year...and so strongly against foreign intervention in Libya and Syria and elsewhere, it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of Ukraine,\" Kerry told the reporters roundtable in his private conference room.\n\nHe insisted however: \"Personally I don't think it's enough for us to be heralding the advent of democracy and applaud the courage of conviction of the people who brought about this transition and then just not doing anything. I think that's unconscionable.\"\n\nHe said it was urgent to move forward, adding: \"I think everybody's on the same page, I think what we're just looking at is what's the appropriate level and how do we go at this.\"\n\nApart from guaranteeing up to $1-billion in loans from global financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Washington was also looking at providing some direct assistance to Kiev.\n\nBut this was still to be decided upon and \"the president has to decide what the level is that he thinks is appropriate to ask for.\"\n\n\"Priority number one is forming the new government, forming it as fast as possible in as broad based a coalition as they can build. Priority number two is reforms, instituting reforms, so that you can lay the groundwork for the IMF. And priority three is the IMF,\" Kerry added.\n\nA White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, meanwhile said \"outside actors\" should \"end provocative rhetoric and actions\" - in an apparent reference to Russia.\n\nHe also told reporters on Air Force One that all governments should keep commitments to transparency about military activities under the Vienna Document of 2011 covering Europe and Central Asia and other Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe obligations designed to ensure security and peace.\n\n\"It is important for all of the parties in the region, both the Ukrainian government as well as the Russians, (to) understand that it is important for them to live up to their obligations.\"",

            "text": "It’s called Crimea. And it is a peninsula that juts into the Black Sea.\n\nTime Magazine’s Simon Shuster just spent two days in the area. He suggests five reasons why it makes a great hiding place for the Ukrainian leader who insisted on keeping close ties with Moscow:\n\n1. The Port City of Sevastopol is home to the Russian Black Sea Naval Fleet. Ukraine threatened to boot the Russians in 2009, but when Yanukovych was reelected in 2010, he negotiated an extension to the lease in exchange for Russian natural gas. Under the agreement, the Russian base will continue to operate until at least 2042. Shuster says about 25,000 troops call the base home, adding that a majority of the town has ties to those troops. Sevastopol's new mayor is also a grandson of Soviet Vice Admiral of the Black Sea Fleet Vasily Chaly. So those ties run deep.\n\n2. The majority of the people are ethnic Russians. In 1954, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave the peninsula to Ukraine. It was mostly a symbolic gesture, as it was still under the control of the Soviet Union. But when that union broke apart in 1991, Crimea became part of the new independent Ukraine, even though some 60 percent of the population consider themselves ethnic Russian. “So the loyalty to Moscow is often greater among the population than it is to Kiev,” Shuster says.\n\n3. The protests never got a foothold in the area. It is hard to sell an anti-Russian protest movement to a place with such dominant ethnic ties to Russia. Shuster says the citizens really don’t like the idea of Ukrainian nationalists coming to power in Kiev. They are worried about being banned from teaching Russian in schools, and the new government installing laws that pull the peninsula closer to Europe and the West.\n\n4. The riot police were hailed as heroes there. In an article for Time, Shuster tells the story of a bus full of Interior Ministry guards and Berkut riot troops returning to Sevastopol after fighting the protesters in Kiev. \"As they pulled onto the square, the crowd surged forward and surrounded them, carrying red carnations, pushing boxes of cookies and cakes toward them, holding babies in the air and cheering,\" he writes.\n\n5. Russia may decide to \"protect\" Crimea's Russians. Chances are slim the superpower will intervene in the area, but if it wants to, it can claim to be protecting Russian citizens. Shuster says the Kremlin used such reasoning to intervene in the country of Georgia in 2008. And almost on cue, Russian Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev released a statement today saying the protests and upheaval in Kiev are “a real threat to our interests and to our citizens’ lives and health.” So if it comes to the point of acting, Moscow may act.",

            "text": "U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry issued the warning after Russian President Vladimir Putin put 150,000 combat troops on high alert for war games near Ukraine, Moscow's boldest gesture since the ouster of ally Viktor Yanukovich as president in Kiev.\n\n\"For a country that has spoken out so frequently ... against foreign intervention in Libya, in Syria, and elsewhere, it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of Ukraine,\" Kerry told a small group of reporters at the U.S. State Department.\n\n\"I don't think there should be any doubt whatsoever that any kind of military intervention that would violate the sovereign territorial integrity of Ukraine would be a huge - a grave mistake,\" he added.\n\n\"If there were any kind of decision like that, I do not think that's a cheap decision. I think it's a very expensive decision.\"\n\nKerry said Washington was considering $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees for Ukraine, as well as possible budget support for the former Soviet republic, but said no decisions had been made. He said Europe was also mulling roughly $1.5 billion in assistance to Ukraine.\n\n\"We are formulating initially a $1 billion loan guarantee with some other pieces, but we are also looking at the possibility of additional assistance,\" Kerry said. The Obama administration was discussing the matter internally, he said.\n\n\"I don't think it's enough to be heralding the advent of democracy and applaud the courage and conviction of the people who brought about this transition and then just not do anything. I think that is unconscionable,\" he added.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki later said the United States was prepared to take immediate steps to help Ukraine's economy after a new government was formed and in coordination with a lending program from the International Monetary Fund, the global financial institution.\n\nUkraine fell into political crisis last year when Yanukovich spurned a broad trade deal with the European Union and accepted a $15 billion Russian bailout that is now in question.\n\nAfter weeks of popular protests and clashes between security forces and demonstrators, Yanukovich fled his Kiev office and Ukraine's parliament voted to remove him from power on Friday.\n\nWith Kiev desperate for cash as it charts a new future, U.S. officials have emphasized that any U.S. funding would complement an IMF program, which would offer oversight of economic reforms and ensure money is being spent properly.\n\nIMF officials told Reuters this week that one option under review to help prop up Ukraine's ailing economy was a bailout that would include IMF money as well as bilateral loans and guarantees from the U.S. and other governments.\n\nThe United States is the IMF's largest and most influential member country. But as the IMF prepares to send a technical mission to Ukraine to assess the state of the economy, IMF insiders say it is important that the institution be seen as an independent broker in Ukraine.\n\nU.S. officials from the White House on down said Russia must respect Ukraine's territorial integrity as Moscow put combat troops on high alert for war games near its Western neighbour.\n\nEarlier this month, a Kremlin aide warned that Moscow could intervene and accused Washington of breaching their 1994 treaty under which Russia removed Soviet nuclear weapons from Ukraine.\n\nIt is unlikely the United States and its allies in NATO would risk an outright military confrontation with Russia but such Russian rhetoric, ringing with echoes of the Cold War, underlines the high stakes in Ukraine, whose 46 million people and sprawling territory are caught in a geopolitical tug-of-war.\n\nKerry said Russia should respect the Ukrainian people's desire for change and that they should not have to choose between relations with Europe and the United States on one hand and Russia on the other.\n\n\"This is not Rocky IV,\" he said in a reference to a 1985 film pitting U.S. boxer Rocky Balboa played by Sylvester Stallone against a Soviet portrayed by Dolph Lundgren.\n\n\"It is not a zero-sum game. We do not view it through the lens of East-West, Russia-U.S. or anything else,\" Kerry added.",

russians there had protested against the new government in kiev while crimean tatars rallied in its support it also came after moscow ordered surprise military exercises in a district bordering ukraine and put troops in the region on high alert the developments stoked concerns about divided loyalties in ukraine and raised the question of russian military intervention which secretary of state john f kerry said would be a grave mistake russia insisted that the exercises were routine in the aftermath of ukraines toppling of its kremlinbacked president viktor yanukovych eyes turned toward the crimean peninsula where ties to russia are especially strong and where the fallen protesters in kiev are viewed not as heroes but as hooligans while the demonstrations have quieted in kiev â the

respect the sovereignty and independence and territorial integrity of ukraine and this is a message that we have also conveyed to whom it may concern he made the remarks as nato defense ministers assembled for a scheduled meeting although ukraine has not sought nato membership it has long cooperated with the alliances operations sending troops to bosnia and afghanistan and participating in nato anti piracy operations off the coast of somalia ukraines acting defense minister is expected to attend a meeting of the natoukraine commission on thursday a city loyal to russia sevastopol embraced news of the russian military exercises and took them as a sign of saber rattling and support sevastopol looks sounds and feels like a little corner of russia and activists here have declared

in the day to support the citys new de facto mayor who is a russian not ukrainian citizen and who took over city hall two days ago hours after the new ukrainian interior minister announced wednesday that he would disband the elite police force that spearheaded most of the attacks on protesters in kiev last week its members were offered sanctuary here in the crimea further stoking concerns about divided loyalties and old schisms in turbulent ukraine these people adequately fulfilled their duty to the country and have shown themselves to be real men said alexey chaly the new head of the coordinating council of sevastopol chaly said the police unit had been abandoned to the mercy of this rabid pack of nazis a reference to the protesters in kiev at this difficult time our city needs decent men who could form the basis of selfdefense groups and in the future the municipal police we are ready to provide for them if they join us in our struggle and to offer safety to their families

policy toward ukraine georgia and the other states that once made up the soviet union was not aimed at reducing russias influence in its neighborhood instead he maintained that us encouragement for former soviet states to integrate with the west was driven by americas desire to see their people realize aspirations for freedom in robust democracies with strong economies this is not rocky iv kerry said referring to the iconic 1985 sylvester stallone film in which an aging american boxer takes on a daunting soviet muscleman it is not a zerosum game we do not view it through the lens of eastwest russiaus or anything else we view it as an example of people within a sovereign nation who are expressing their desire to choose their future and thats a very powerful force noting that russian president vladimir putin on wednesday ordered largescale military exercises in what many see as a show of force or possible prelude to intervention in ukraine kerry said it would be hypocritical for moscow to send troops into another country after spending the last several years opposing foreign military action in places like libya and syria for a country that has spoken out so frequently in the last year against foreign intervention in libya syria elsewhere it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of ukraine kerry said any kind of military intervention that would violate the sovereign territorial integrity of ukraine would be a huge a grave mistake and the territorial integrity of ukraine needs to be respected white house spokesman josh earnest urged outside actors to respect ukraines sovereignty without specifically mentioning russia earnest also called on others in the region to end provocative rhetoric and actions on assistance kerry said it was urgent to move forward to help ukraine but also said it was urgent for ukraines interim authorities to enact reforms curb corruption and prepare free and fair elections he said the planned 1 billion in us loan guarantees would be accompanied by additional aid to be determined later in consultation with congress as well as about 15 billion from the european union along with loans from global financial institutions kerry made the comments in a roundtable interview with a small group of reporters at the state department where he presided over a meeting of the usgeorgia strategic partnership commission earlier wednesday at that meeting he announced additional but unspecified us assistance to help support georgias european and euroatlantic vision and he denounced russias continued military presence in the breakaway georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia in violation of the ceasefire that ended the 2008 russiageorgia conflict he stressed that the us supports georgias membership in nato â something opposed by russia â and wants to see it sign a partnership agreement with the european union later this year a similar proposed agreement between ukraine and the eu was among the catalysts that led to the deadly unrest in kiev that unseated russianbacked president viktor yanukovych last week some russian officials accuse the west of being behind the revolt against yanukovych us and european officials have denied such allegations in addition to putin ordering the military exercises russias defense ministry said it would take steps to strengthen security at facilities of the russian black sea fleet in ukraines crimean peninsula where there have been clashes between pro and antirussian demonstrators prorussian protesters have spoken of secession and a russian lawmaker has stoked their passions by promising that russia will protect them those steps have raised fears of possible russian military intervention in ukraine along the lines of its 2008 operation in georgia which led to the occupations of abkhazia and south ossetia and was roundly condemned by the united states and its european allies kerry sitting next to georgian prime minister irakli garibashvili affirmed that the us remains steadfast in our support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity we continue to object to russias occupation militarization and borderization of georgian territory and we call on russia to fulfil its obligations under the 2008 ceasefire agreement including the withdrawal of forces and free access for humanitarian assistance kerry said financial times arseniy yatseniuk poised to become ukraine prime minister by roman olearchyk in kiev Â©reuters arseny yatseniuk arseniy yatseniuk is poised to

yatseniuks name parliament is expected to uphold his appointment in a vote on thursday this government is fated to serve only three to four months as it will need to take some unpopular decisions oleksandr turchynov acting president told the throng as the names of mr yatseniuk and other putative senior members of the new administration were announced the countrys business community was more enthusiastic yatseniuk is a very experienced politician with understanding of what business needs and of the global financial markets said tomas fiala president of the kievbased european business

bank chief foreign minister economy minister and chairman of parliament he was also deputy head of the presidential administration during viktor yushchenkos term as president in 200510 he also has the

civic activists to oversee it andriy parubiy a lawmaker who served as commander of the protest movements guards was chosen to serve as chair of the national security and defence council victoria siumar a civil society activist and dmytro yarosh head of right sector a militant protest group were proposed as his deputies one of the administrations first tasks will be to bring to justice members of mr yanukovichs government who fled last weekend warrants for their arrest were issued this week but the whereabouts of many senior politicians and officials is not known the country is facing serious economic challenges in this crisis and most likely a lot of money was stolen a western banker in kiev said this revolution gives new hope and i am positive on the country in the longterm view the new government must bring the criminals to justice and seize their assets it should try to recover as much money as possible â they will need it window on eurasia window on eurasia ukraine is as ukrainian as the russian federation is russian paul goble staunton february 27 â despite the frequent appearance of maps showing a large swatch of ukraine being ethnic russian ukraine in terms of the ethnic composition of its population is almost exactly as ukrainian as the russian federation is russian moreover none of ukraine is defined as an ethnic autonomy while nearly half of the territory of the russian federation is as rashit akhmetov the editor of zvezda povolzhya points out in the new issue of his kazan weekly 77 percent of the population of ukraine consists of ethnic ukrainians according to the latest census in the russian federation 80 percent of the population consists of ethnic russians no 7 february 27 2014 p 1 given various problems with the censuses especially in russia where various experts have suggested there was an overcount of several million ethnic russians along with an overcount of slightly fewer nonrussians in the north caucasus that puts the two countries in a statistical dead heat as far as ethnic homogeneity is concerned moreover ukraine does not have even nominally ethnofederalism its only autonomy is crimea which is explicitly defined in nonethnic terms russia in contrast has 21 autonomous ethnic republics and before vladimir putin began his amalgamation program they formed 53 percent now they form slightly less than half of the territory consequently if moscow and western commentators who routinely draw a picture of ukraine as if it were almost equally and deeply divided between a ukrainian center and west and a russian east were to prepare analogous ethnic maps for the russian federation the latter country would look to be a better candidate for coming apart than is ukraine at present akhmetov points out there are seven million ethnic russians in ukraine alongside 41 million ethnic ukrainians and in the eastern parts of the country where many assume ethnic russians dominate ethnic ukrainians do in most thus 70 percent of the population of kharkhiv oblast is ethnically ukrainian and 57 percent of odessa oblast is as well it is true the kazan editor acknowledges that the eastern oblast overwhelmingly vote for the party of power just as ethnic russians in russia tend to do but the ethnic russians in both places will do so even if the party of power changes as soon as one party of power loses to another this portion of the population will follow in the ussr he recalls there were 16 million communists but their power and their support disappeared over the course of three days the myth of the prorussia orientation of the eastern oblasts of urkaine is one thought u by moscow propaganda akhmetov says these regions are not seeking to unite with russia and not just because 70 percent of the population of these regions is ethnically ukrainian it is because they want to live in ukraine and not in putins russia it is certainly true he continues that ethnic russians in eastern ukraine do not like what moscow is describing as fascists and bandits but neither do ukrainians and the kazan editor says that he suspects that there are more fascists in russia today than there are banderites in ukraine akhmetovs own republic tatarstan he says has been interested in european integration since the 1990s indeed that republics president at the time mintimir shaymiyev declared that his strategic goals was to transform tatarstan into a model european region of russia according to the editor the first steps of the europeanization of russia are completely possible in tatarstan the republic should receive the status of a free european political zone and it should be possible to locate certain european institutions in kazan such as a branch of the european human rights court russia would benefit from this akhmetov argues it will not benefit and will be harmed by a confrontation with europe but the moscow media suggest that many in the russian capital do not understand this and do not recognize that it can not rely on force or its own black hundreds organizations and hope to both remain in power and to modernize the country if putin changes course at home and in relations with europe he could become a major historical figure like peter the great but if he does not the future for him and his country â and one should add the countries around it and the world â will be far far bleaker the washington times inside the ring all eyes on moscows military moves in ukraine by bill gertz us intelligence agencies are stepping up their spying on russia s military amid concerns that moscow is preparing to use force against ukraine in the wake of the prodemocracy revolution in kiev earlier this week intelligence agencies reported that two ural4320 trucks full of armed russian troops were observed arriving in the black sea port of yalta photographs made by a ukrainian civilian were posted online as the troop transports entered a russian military facility in yalta on the crimean peninsula in ukraine other activities in recent days have included the movement of armored personnel carriers observed at russias black sea fleet headquarters in nearby sevastopol us officials said the purpose of the troops is not known but speculation centers on the possibility of the troops being used as part of an advance force for a future russian military operation us intelligence agencies also are tracking possible covert infiltration of russian spetsnaz commandos one concern is that moscow will provoke a conflict by using the undercover commandos to attack ethnic russians and then launch an invasion under the guise of protecting those russians some 8 million russians reside in ukraine making up about 17 percent of the population tensions remain high between moscow and kiev sic kyiv over the recent ouster of ukraine s prorussia president viktor yanukovych who now is being sought on murder charges in a sign of moscows concern over losing what it regards as a strategic neighbor president vladimir putin ordered russian forces on a higher state of alert tuesday the mobilization includes forces some 200 miles from russia s southern border with ukraine the mobilization could indicate a future military operation although moscows defense ministry said the troop movements are not related to the unrest in ukraine the obama administration has issued indirect warnings to russia not to intervene militarily the latest signal made by deputy secretary of state william burns during a visit tuesday to kiev we strongly support ukraine s territorial integrity and its unity mr burns told reporters at the us embassy in kiev asked about the russian military activities in the crimea and how far the united states is prepared to go to prevent military intervention mr burns said all that i would stress is what i said before and that is that the united states strongly supports the unity and the territorial integrity of ukraine mr burns said speculation over splitting ukraine into prorussian and proeuropean regions is not in ukraine s interest and the united states will continue to reinforce that very firm position he said â¢ contact bill gertz at billgertz the wall street journal us stakes in ukraine tied to location location washington â ukraine isnt typically a us foreign policy priority experts say president barack obama is more occupied with syria iran afghanistan and more his administration rejects the notion that the situation in ukraine represents some kind of epic east vs west power struggle still there are reasons why americans should care about whats happening there starting with location location location 1 its all about the neighborhood sure it would be nice for ukraine to have a stable democratic government simply because thats a good thing and no one wants to see more bloodshed but the us is more concerned about ukraine because of its location perched between russia and the rest of europe where the us has lots of friends the us has an interest in a wider stable secure europe says steven pifer a former us ambassador to ukraine whos now at the brookings institution if ukraine goes into chaos thats likely to pull those european countries in â and we may get involved later on too 2 big questions about the march of democracy the overthrow of kievs democratically elected but corrupt and repressive government by protesters seeking a more just ukraine raises unsettling questions ukraine doesnt fit this ideal model of how democratic change progresses says olga oliker associate director of rand corps international security and defense policy center what does it mean to try to create more democratic systems in nondemocratic ways 3 looking out for a friend ukraines actually been a good friend to the us since gaining independence from the soviet union in 1991 it was once home to the worlds thirdlargest nuclear weapons arsenal and voluntarily surrendered the stockpile to russia it sent troops to help out in iraq in 200305 and dispatched peacekeepers to kosovo and lebanon it agreed to cancel a planned 45 million nuclear deal with iran in 1992 on a lot of foreign policy issues theyve been fairly helpful and i would argue that that is one reason why we ought to care about what is going on pifer says 4 russia the unrest in ukraine could complicate usrussian relations the obama administration dismisses the idea of competing spheres of influence as wildly outmoded and deliberately has tried not to insert itself too deeply in the situation but russian president vladimir putin very much wants to tilt ukraine his direction the usrussian relationship has been very combative lately and scratchy says andrew weiss a clinton administration expert on ukraine and russia whos now at the carnegie endowment for international peace ukraine adds one more layer on top of the problems that already exist 5 people business money people theres obvious concern among the estimated 1 million to 15 million people of ukrainian descent in the us with large concentrations in chicago philadelphia cleveland sacramento calif and the new york city area business ukraine an economic mess is not a big us trading partner but theres plenty of commercial potential in a country of 46 million people money ukraine is in dire need of billions of dollars in financial assistance the main lender is likely to be the international monetary fund but secretary of state john kerry said wednesday the us plans to provide 1 billion in loan guarantees to ukraine and will consider additional direct assistance the wall street journal ukraine seeks international bailout imf to send mission to kiev sic kyiv likely to require tough conditions for aid by andrey ostroukh in moscow ian talley in washington and laurence norman in brussels updated feb 27 2014 241 pm et ukraines new government on thursday set in motion requests for international financial assistance as it attempts to cement its standing following the removal of the countrys president over the weekend the move comes amid growing pressure on the ukrainian governments finances with the currency falling sharply in recent days and foreign exchange reserves declining ukraine hopes to secure a bailout from the international monetary fund russia and other countries willing to offer aid ukraines newly appointed finance minister oleksandr shlapak on thursday said the government will seek at least 15 billion in aid from the imf the imf separately said it received a bailout request from ukraine and will send a team to kiev soon to undertake negotiations we are ready to respond and in the coming days will send an imf factfinding mission team to kiev to undertake a preliminary dialogue with authorities imf managing director christine lagarde said in a written statement ms lagarde said the imf is in talks with other countries as part of a larger financing package ukraines finances are on the verge of collapse after the ouster of former prorussian president viktor yanukovych the imf aid request came shortly after an interim government was appointed in ukraine mr shlapak also said that the newly appointed government will continue talks with russia about credit line extensions and a discount on gas supplies with the goal of reaching agreements in early march ukraine is seeking aid to help it pay existing foreign debt finance reforms and stabilize its currency the hryvnia officials engaged in discussions with ukraine said the country needs 4 billion immediately by the end of 2015 ukraine hopes to raise some 35 billion the european union and the us are exploring aid packagesâboth shortterm assistance and larger longerterm aidâbut some of the assistance will likely be linked to an imf loan deal being agreed upon first we are looking to provide immediate assistance for urgent needs in the next couple months in close cooperation with an imf reform package in the medium term we will also look into combined international efforts in support of bigger reform programs a senior eu diplomat said among the shortterm options under review by the us and eu are small bilateral bridge loans loan guarantees and a shortterm emergency credit line from the imf that isnt tied to the strict conditions a largescale bailout requires the imf chief said the washingtonbased lender would first make a technical assessment of the economic situation and ukraines needs and start discussing with ukraines transitional government the policy reforms that could form the basis of a fundsupported program the imf has said it would require tough conditions for any bailout because of the failure of kiev to live up to previous financing program requirements us and european officials have said they would also require conditions imf spokesman gerry rice at a thursday press briefing said kiev has indicated it will commit to wideranging reforms as part of its bailout request mr rice said he couldnt address possible timing of an imf bailout or whether the fund would consider a shortterm emergency credit line while a largescale program is negotiated the imf has previously pushed for kiev to depreciate its currency phase out fuel subsidies and tighten it government spending on wednesday us secretary of state john kerry said washington could provide some 1 billion in loan guarantees for ukraine to help the economy the eu is also exploring a number of stepsâfrom possible financial assistance to help with energy security and improved market accessâin parallel to an imfled international package eu officials say however that the bloc can only unlock a boostedup financial lifeline which could reach around â¬1 billion once some kind of imf program is in place mr yanukovych was in talks with the imf for much of last year concerning extending a loan program but he rejected the washingtonbased lenders demands that ukraine cut energy subsidies and devalue its currency the eu has also said it hopes to bring russia on board as part of an international assistance package russia agreed a 15 billion loan for ukraine in december after mr yanukovych abandoned a broad economic and political agreement with the eu however it has put that assistance on hold following mr yanukovychs ouster write to andrey ostroukh at this email address is being protected from spambots you need javascript

gunmen on thursday seized government buildings in the capital of the crimea region of ukraine barricaded themselves inside and raised the russian flag raising the specter of a separatist rebellion that could tear the country apart further inflaming an increasingly volatile situation viktor f yanukovych released a statement thursday saying that he remained the lawful president of ukraine and appealed to russia to protect my personal safety while his precise whereabouts remained a mystery russian news agencies reported subsequently that mr yanukovych would hold a news conference on friday in rostovondon a city in southern russia six days after he was driven from power by mass protests and fled from kiev the ukrainian capital everyone now needs to step back and avoid any kind of provocations over ukraine said mr kerry who said that he had proposed that the united states and russia try to cooperate on easing tensions there in the crimean regional capital simferopol local police officers sealed off access to the government buildings including the regional parliament which were seized in mysterious overnight raids by people who appeared to be militant ethnic russians a spokeswoman for the speaker vladimir konstantinov said that parliament had voted to hold a referendum on greater autonomy on may 25 the scheduled date of a presidential election crimea has been a source of tension between ukraine and russia for decades the territory was transferred to ukraine by the russian federation when they were both components of the soviet union in 1954 and ukraine retained it when the soviet union collapsed in 1991 though russia still maintains important military bases there including the home port of the black sea fleet oleksandr v turchynov the speaker of parliament and acting president of ukraine urged russian military forces early on thursday not to stray out of the designated russian military zones i am addressing the russian black sea fleet command with a demand all military servicemen should stay within the boundaries of of the territories stipulated by agreement mr turchynov said as he presided over the parliament any movement of military servicemen with weapons outside this territory will be viewed as military aggression in his statement mr yanukovych warned that the largely russian regions in eastern and southern ukraine including crimea would not accept the anarchy and outright lawlessness that has gripped the country i continue to consider myself the lawful head of the ukrainian government elected on the basis of the free expression of the will of ukrainian citizens he said in the statement according to news agencies ria novosti and itartass i can not be indifferent to the tragic events in my homeland whether he can cling to any part of his former power remains far from clear members of his own party have deserted him and the ukrainian parliament impeached him and moved on thursday to approve an interim government with elections for a new president planned for may ukraines political and cultural divisions ukraines political split reflects a deeper cultural divide in the country in the 2010 presidential election the opposition won in all of ukraines western provinces where most people speak ukrainian rather than russian and many call for deeper economic and political ties with europe mr yanukovychs remarks were his first since saturday when he appeared in a video that apparently was recorded in his political base in eastern ukraine even in his diminished and humiliated position with journalists and ordinary people traipsing through his presidential palace and sorting through incriminating records mr yanukovych asserted his authority over the countrys armed forces and warned that they should not be called in to quell the apparent rebellion in simferopol i as the actual president have not allowed the armed forces of ukraine to interfere in the ongoing internal political events he said contradicting reports that he had ordered the military to intervene in kiev only to have his order rebuffed i continue to order this in the case that anyone begins to give a similar order to the armed forces and power structures those orders will be unlawful and criminal russia has denounced the political upheaval in kiev and refused to recognize the new interim government but officials have also insisted that russia would not intervene even as it began a major military drill on ukraines doorstep granting sanctuary to mr yanukovych even as he claims to lead ukraine would nonetheless deepen the confrontation with europe and the united states russias foreign minister sergey v lavrov has repeatedly insisted that ukraines leaders were bound by an agreement mediated by three european foreign ministers that agreement signed last friday called for an interim national unity government and new elections but not until december mr yanukovychs statement echoed that position though it appears highly unlikely that the collapse of that agreement could now be reversed the overnight raids in simferopol created an ominous uncertainty here and left residents stunned the raids took place just hours after thousands of crimean tatars the regions minority indigenous turkic population and a separate throng of ethnic russians staged competing rallies outside crimeas regional parliament the rallies which ended in a melee and left several people injured disrupted a session of the regional parliament that hardline prorussia groups had hoped would declare crimeas secession from ukraine this is the first step toward civil war said igor baklanov a computer expert who joined a group of anxious residents gathered in a cold drizzle at a police line near the seized regional legislature rumors swirled of russian troops on the way from sevastopol the headquarters of russias black sea fleet of russian nationalists arriving in force to reinforce the blockaded government buildings and of negotiations between the local authorities and the unidentified gunmen nobody knows who what or why said a resident who identified himself only as gennady and who voiced alarm that the armed action could set off a spiral of violence in a region riven by political ethnic and religious differences crimeans supporting russia marched into a square in front of the barricaded regional parliament building waving flags and chanting rossiya rossiya with most streets in simferopol empty of traffic after authorities ordered a citywide holiday columns of prorussia activists marched into a square in front of the barricaded parliament building waving russian flags and chanting rossiya rossiya they swelled an angry but peaceful throng that wants crimea to split from ukraine and join russia the regional parliament called an emergency session for friday afternoon though it was unclear if one could be held in an occupied and now fortified building refat chubalov a member of the assembly and leader of crimeas ethnic tatar minority said he had not been informed about the session and warned that any vote to separate crimea from ukraine would be very dangerous asserting that russian armored vehicles were waiting outside the city he called for calm but also urged tatar residents to form selfdefense units to protect their interests he blamed prorussian forces for the overnight seizure of government buildings describing the action as a direct interference in the affairs of crimea and of ukraine the developments came as the authorities in kiev and moscow traded bellicose warnings mr lavrov was quoted as saying that his country would defend its compatriots in ukraine uncompromisingly while officials in kiev warned the russian military to remain within its base in sevastopol around noon pyotr mekhed the choice of the interim government for minister of defense walked out of parliament and huddled with a group of his supporters among ukrainian veterans of the soviet war in afghanistan the veterans earlier in the morning had driven an armored car onto the plaza in front of parliament saying they wanted to show moral support for our candidate mr mekhed oleg mikhnyuk a commander of a unit of afghan veterans called the afghan hundred who protested on maidan square said that in the discussion the veterans had weighed the significance of the armed takeover of the regional parliament in crimea a few hours earlier they concluded that the armed and masked men taking action in the south were probably russian commandos and that war with russia on the peninsula loomed for any new minister of defense this is already a declaration of war mr mikhnyuk said of events in crimea remarks in kyiv state department remarks william j burns deputy secretary of state us embassy kyiv ukraine february 26 2014 httpwwwstategovsd2014222569htm deputy secretary burns good morning i am delighted to be back in kyiv at this historic moment president obama and secretary kerry asked me to convey a simple messageâa message of deep admiration for the courage and determination of ukrainians in the face of last weeks tragic violence and a message of strong american support for a stable democratic inclusive and prosperous ukraine i was profoundly moved by my conversations last evening at st michaels cathedral with the medics religious leaders civil society activists and protesters who demonstrated for the whole world such bravery and selflessness on the maidan let me repeat my sincerest condolences to the family members and loved ones of all who were injured or lost their lives in pursuit of a more just and democratic ukraine their sacrifices inspire us all and their selflessness should be a source of strength as ukrainians seek to heal their societys wounds renew their democracy and revive their economy i have had extensive meetings over the past two days with a wide range of ukrainian leaders including speaker turchynov mr yatsenuk mr klychko mr tyahanybok mr poroshenko mr tihipko and former prime minister tymoshenko i also met with lady ashton the eu high representative and un special envoy robert serry with whom we share a strong interest in supporting ukraine on its democratic path in all my meetings i emphasized the urgent importance of the radas efforts to form a multiparty technical government that represents all regions of ukraine once that government is formed we and our international partners can begin to take immediate steps to help support ukraine economically and implement the reforms necessary to restore ukraines political and economic health a team of economic specialists from the department of treasury and white house accompanied me to kyiv and will stay on after my departure today to continue our consultations we also look forward to working with the new government and civil society to support free and fair presidential elections in may we will continue to firmly support ukraines unity and territorial integrity and healthy relations with all of its neighbors including russia again i am glad to be in ukraine as it enters a crucial period in its history a period of considerable challenges but also great promise the united states stands with the ukrainian people at this remarkable moment and we will do all we can to help them build the strong sovereign and democratic country they so richly deserve question so you are talking about the immediate steps for the government in ukraine what exactly are you talking about is this just the matter of time for the expats to know the situation here or is it that you have something planned in mind to help to support is it just not involving in the political situation just economics or is it politics as well deputy secretary burns we will provide strong support not only for the revival of the ukrainian economy but also support for the political process which has to begin with the formation of a new multiparty technocratic government that will help prepare the way for free and fair elections in may which as you know better than i do will be very important for the future of this country we also have an interest in working with our international partners to support the efforts of the new government to try and improve the security situation in this country as well on the economic side the reality is that the new government that will be formed will inherit an economic mess its a reality that ukraine has always had a great deal of economic potential but its also a reality that its business climate has never matched that potential that can change it is possible to realize that potential it is possible to fight corruption and all the other impediments to realizing that potential we recognize that that effort will require and deserves support from the friends of ukraine like the united states like the european union like the imf and were working quite practically and quite intensively to be ready to provide that support the first step again is the formation of a new government and an opportunity to sit down with that new government and identify the plans of the new ukrainian government their diagnosis of the problem and then identify specifically what we can do to help and well be ready to do that along with the eu and the imf because we recognize the urgency of the situation we recognize whats at stake for ukraine and for the ukrainian people question id like to hear more about the groups that are staying behind what exactly are they doing their tasking their mission and how far you have moved in what you described as an intensive study of ukraines problems i would like to hear more detail about that deputy secretary burns sure i have one colleague from the treasury department and one colleague from the white house staff who have accompanied me here to kyiv they have met with the central bank governor the acting finance minister a range of other bankers and economic specialists here they are also meeting with colleagues from the eu and imf to try to coordinate in anticipation of the formation of a new government so that we can be ready to move ahead once that new government has begun to lay out its plans and its needs we dont want to waste any time in trying to be prepared we recognize the magnitude of the challenge and there are a lot of resources the international community can bring to bear in support of the imf question as you know russia has not yet recognized the current government and what do you think the west should to do to convince russia to recognize us and even to give us some help some aid to clear this mess and what do you think about mr brzezinskis propositionsuggestion that there should be some kind of federalization of ukraine deputy secretary burns ill just say a couple of things first let me reinforce the american position that we strongly support the choices that ukrainians make to renew their democracy and revive their economy we strongly support ukraines territorial integrity and its unity that is deeply in the interest not just of ukrainians but in our view of the entire international community including russia and so we hope over time to build on a common interest in a stable prosperous ukraine i recognize all the challenges that lie ahead but i do have considerable faith in the capacity of ukrainians to make the right choices and certainly as they do they can count on the strong and continued support of the united states question there is evidence in the ukrainian media and from observers of russian military equipment in crimea what do you think about those reports and evidence and how far is the united states prepared to go to prevent any military intervention or any military game in this context deputy secretary burns all that i would stress is what i said before and that is that the united states strongly supports the unity and the territorial integrity of ukraine separatism of the sort that youve seen some speculation about in recent days is not in ukraines interest and its not in anybodys interest and the united states will continue to reinforce that very firm position question in what way do you think ukraine establishes this good healthy relationship with russia you know it is quite hard for us to have relations with russia on an everyday basis what other dangerous situations do you see for ukraine deputy secretary burns on the first part of your question i dont underestimate the challenges ahead but objectively it seems to me to be very much in the interests of both ukraine and russia to have a healthy economic relationship and also over time to build a stable and healthy political relationship thats never easy on the broader question on what kinds of challenges ukraine faces right now you all know them far better than i do you live them there are obviously economic challenges and there are bigger political and social challenges theres going to be a challenge to good leadership in ukraine to be able to reach out to people across this country whether east or west north and south and help heal the wounds of recent weeks and months thats also never easy especially after the emotion and the loss that people have suffered but thats what i meant by drawing inspiration from the selflessness of the people on the maidan to try to put the interests of the country above personal rivalries or political ambitions question my first question did you discuss with any of the ukrainian highranking officials who you met the issue of the possible nato membership perspective for ukraine in the future was this issue raised in the discussions and talks that you had and my second question you mentioned that now the united states and the eu are standing hand in hand in unity with respect to ukraine dont you think that now its a time to do everything possible to promote the idea of eu membership for ukraine because like now its a bigger opportunity to do that and we dont have much time what do you think about it deputy secretary burns we did not discuss the first issue at least in the meetings that ive had over the last day and a half and on the second issue weve been strongly in favor of the choices that ukrainians have made in the past and will continue to make in the future the interests that ukrainians have in a european future the pace of that and the mechanics of that are obviously up to ukrainians and to the european union but the united states certainly continues to be strongly supportive of that choice information officer thats all the time we have question do you know where our president is deputy secretary burns i dont i dont have any more light to shed on that this morning question did this inaudible ever come up in the conversations with the leaders deputy secretary burns a general conversation about it but i as i said i dont have any more light to shed on it this morning interview with secretary kerry state department httpukraineusembassygovstatementskerrymsnbchtml us department of state office of the spokesperson february 26 2014 interview treaty room washington dc question and good day im andrea mitchell live from the state department here in washington secretary of state john kerry joins me now here in the treaty room mr secretary thank you very much secretary kerry glad to be with you thank you question thanks for being with us obviously a lot of crises to cover but first of mine is ukraine vladimir putin has issued an order for a drill mobilizing troops in the west of russia how worried should we be about any kind of military action from russia into ukraine secretary kerry well andrea first of all let me just say that what has happened in ukraine is quite remarkable its a demonstration of the rapidity with which the peoples will will be heard or felt in todays society and i think the rapidity with which it has moved should frankly be a message to russia and mr putin should listen carefully to ukrainians who have voiced their desire for change thats number one number two president putin in a telephone conversation with president obama just the other day committed to respect the territorial integrity of ukraine and i think thats incredibly important it would be very difficult for me to understand how russia would reconcile its position on libya its position on syria its warnings against intervention in another country and then not respect the sovereignty of ukraine and the will of the people thereso were hoping that russia will not see this as sort of a continuation of the cold war we dont see it that way we do not believe this should be an eastwest russiaunited states â this is not rocky iv believe me we dont see it that way we see this as an opportunity for russia the united states and others to strengthen ukraine help them in this transition and theres no reason that they cant look east and west and be involved as a vital cog in the economy of all of us going forward and thats what our hope is â that theres a transition government that there are reforms put in place that the imf becomes involved and that the ukrainian people have an opportunity to decide their future after theyve formed a new government question the russian foreign ministry only today said that the opposition and the rebellion in ukraine are extremists they are really dialing up the rhetoric in the last 24 hours secretary kerry well theres been some hard statements i think that â i think to some degree russia has not been in touch with some of whats been happening on the ground here i think there were some encouragements by some people for yanukovych â president yanukovych to take â former president yanukovych to take a very harsh position here and i think the people made their wishes and their aspirations as clear as you can make it â 75plus people killed in the streets a remarkable day or several days of extraordinary violence which their courage is now being rewarded and i think russia needs to be very careful in the judgments that it makes going forward here we are not looking for confrontation but we are making it clear that every country should respect the territorial integrity here the sovereignty of ukraine russia has said it will do that and we think its important that russia keeps its word question do we know where yanukovych is secretary kerry well im not going to speculate on the whereabouts of yanukovych question well should he be prosecuted for war crimes secretary kerry im not going to speculate on any of the accountability components generically we believe that anybody who made a decision or anybody who created these several days of government violence against their own people ought to be held accountable but the first thing that has to happen is to establish a new government the people have spoken through their elected representatives this is active politics at the grassroots that has sprung up in the rada their legislature they have voted according to their process incidentally they followed their procedures they had the requisite number of votes people who previously supported yanukovych changed their positions pulled their support away from him and voted to impeach him so i mean this has been a democratic process that has been felt in profound ways and now i think its important for everybody to respect it and let the people of ukraine find their government create a reform process have elections and begin to get their economy moving and thats perhaps the most important thing here russia does not need or want a ukraine that is unstable and more violent going forward and economically a basket case its in everybodys interest to try to help put this back together and have a democratic pluralistic ukraine question and â but putin seems to think that we are meddling is the united states meddling you know that there are those overheard conversations in the â secretary kerry well you know that â no the united states has been engaged with a country and with its people in the way that we are around the world engaged like any country i mean its no different i mean russia is engaged with assad in syria russia is engaged in various places around the world through its diplomacy trying to meet its interests and we are engaged and have been engaged with ukraine for a long period of time as they have expressed their will to try to sign up for the association agreement with europe and the eastern partnership thats what they wanted to do russia then came in and engaged with a 15 billion program and different things i mean i dont think we need a sort of backandforth about who is pushing what set of opportunities for the people of ukraine the key here is to give the people of ukraine the full space within which to make their decisions about where they want to go thats what were trying to do were not putting pressure on them were not urging something that they havent themselves expressed as a desire we are trying to honor their intentions of putting together a democratic pluralistic government that breaks away from this kleptocracy that existed there and now were beginning to get some insights on the lifestyle of mr yanukovych with his multimilliondollar dining room and his yachts and the rest of it and this is what the people were rebelling against so i dont think theres any defense of what was there what we need now to do is not get into an old cold war confrontation we need to work together in what does not have to be a zerosum game to provide the capacity of the people of ukraine to choose their future thats all thats at stake opinion moscow times what kievs sic kyiv democratic turn means for moscow 25 february 2014 issue 5317 by anders Ã¥slund last week the ukrainian opposition suddenly gained a parliamentary majority through democratic and legal means as lawmakers defected in droves from president viktor yanukovych after his killing of 82 people in kiev in three days on feb 22 the president was impeached with the required twothirds majority it is still early to say how this transition to democracy will work but it looks promising what will this mean to russia the ukrainian protests present a challenge to all russians putin must realize the eurasian union is stillborn and russia needs the eu for the last three decades i have been deeply involved in both russia and ukraine to a foreigner common russian attitudes toward ukraine are clearly contradictory russians will tell you that ukrainians are their brother nation but at the same time they claim that ukraine is not a real nation ukrainian not an actual language and ukrainians are intellectually backward russians can barely hide their superiority complex toward ukraine ukrainians take note and object in their quiet polite fashion in late 2004 the orange revolution turned the tables on the russians suddenly ukraine was ahead in terms of democracy freedom and modernity although not in economic policy or wealth president vladimir putin swiftly adopted a series of laws to curtail civil society and safeguard his authoritarian rule since the orange government turned out to be disorganized putin could relax in february 2010 yanukovych won a free but not very fair presidential election with 49 percent of the vote in a runoff at the time the common view was that yanukovych would turn into a putin by installing a political vertical of power and greatly enriching his loyalists yanukovychs problem was that he had not learned putins sophisticated art of sharing instead he concentrated all wealth in a tiny family circle alienating everybody else his political base did not expand but narrowed as his political legitimacy dwindled he imposed more repression russians have accepted some repression because their standard of living has risen palpably but yanukovychs predatory economic policies caused economic output to stagnate in the end ukrainians asked themselves why should we accept a leader who robs and represses our country and only cares about himself but dissatisfaction alone is rarely sufficient it requires a catalyst to be unleashed foolishly yanukovych provided such a catalyst with the european union agreement that he first endorsed and then rejected few were concerned about the freetrade agreement but it represented a choice of civilization would ukraine go for european values â freedom and justice democracy and the rule of law â or for corruption and authoritarianism to ukrainians the choice was clearcut and they stood up in protest the ukrainian public protests present a challenge to all russians this might explain the uncommonly crude russian television propaganda about ukraine a month ago i participated in a political panel of 10 people at the gaidar forum in moscow i was the sole panelist who wasnt a russian political analyst the general view was that political stability and economic stagnation would prevail in russia this year if anything were to shake the country six of us suggested it would be ukraines euromaidan euromaidan challenges russians perception of themselves russians identify themselves as brave for good reason but now they look cowardly next to ukrainians for less good reason opinion polls show that russians consider themselves as people of traditional values yet now they look like cynical cowards while ukrainians have defended their nation and universal values such as freedom democracy and justice after many years of cynicism the ukrainian public has decided to clear out more than 40 lenin monuments which represent inhumane ideals this is ukraines moment of decommunization a period that lasted all too briefly in russia in august 1991 in moscow lenin still rests in his mausoleum on red square the most evident blow to the kremlin is that the victory of euromaidan means that the eurasian union will not take place the union is protectionist and economically damaging to all its members if putin wants to enter the modern world he had better abandon it and opt for european integration like ukraine the eurasian union could fail through falling growth rates in russia combined with excessive subsidies to belarus the ultimate insult to putin would be if a dissatisfied president nursultan nazarbayev declares that kazakhstan will leave the association the yanukovych model of presidential robber capitalism was much more crude and singleminded than the elaborate putin model of state and crony capitalism but both men share the view that presidents are entitled to toplevel corruption and authoritarianism while yanukovych is now being chased like a criminal on the run putin must feel somewhat less comfortable he expressed such discomfort after his friend moammar gadhafi of libya was chased and killed meanwhile russias economic growth has dwindled since 2009 and now seems to have stopped because of putins policy of state and crony capitalism putins reserves are running low therefore euromaidan puts the putin regime in a new light to thinking russians if ukrainians can rise against authoritarianism and corruption and opt for european values and integration why shouldnt we be able to do so too the kremlin faces a stark choice one possibility is that it will choose the same policies as after the orange revolution hostility to ukraine including cuts in gas deliveries and trade sanctions and increased repression at home but those policies were possible when the russian standard of living rose more than ever putin also was lucky that ukraines orange government collapsed on its own now the economic backdrop is much worse the russian standard of living is barely rising russias client yanukovych has been exposed as a greedy thief and executioner abandoned by his own party the ukrainian revolutionaries and all the more the ukrainian people have likely learned their lesson from the failure of the orange revolution presumably the kremlin realizes that euromaidan proves its old policy is no longer viable as democracy has broken through in ukraine the crudest russian propaganda about euromaidan appears to have abated but is putin able to realize that his eurasian union is stillborn and that russias best hope is european values and european integration euromaidan might wake russians up but i wouldnt bet on it the national interest ukrainian shock western therapy william courtney february 27 2014 events in ukraine evoke memories of the soviet collapse in 1991 then a hidebound system slid into bankruptcy lost popular respect and plunged into the ash heap of history now two decades of stasis in ukraine might suffer a similar fate but only if the next government reverses course and embraces bold reform then as now the right western policy is to support reform and realistic aspirations and not back specific leaders or excuse poor performance lethargy gripped ukraine for over a decade under its first two presidents leonid kravchuk and leonid kuchma the countrys first popular uprising the 2004 orange revolution brought hopes for change incompetent and selfaggrandizing leadersâincluding president viktor yushchenko and prime ministers yulia tymoshenko and viktor yanukovychâturned hopes into dismay none pursued the reforms ukraine needed to lift its economy out of poverty and pay for russian gas unlike georgia after its 2003 rose revolution orange leaders did not clean out or diminish bloated sovietstyle bureaucracy ukraine remained vulnerable to constant russian pressures ukraines second successful popular uprising offers cause for optimism the country has experienced several democratic and largely peaceful changes in power notwithstanding yanukovychs recent brutality civil society has become more robust a vibrant ukrainian diaspora in the west extends encouragement and ukraine has come to be seen in europe as european to secure wider freedoms and better governance vast numbers of courageous ukrainians have twice gone into the streets to oppose semiauthoritarian rule the west has been properly supportive on january 31 german chancellor angela merkel said the oppositions efforts were justified and there was a great need for change in ukraine on february 19 president obama cautioned that yanukovychs government would be held primarily responsible for the treatment of peaceful protesters and he warned of consequences for those who step over the line europe marshaled its outrage at yanukovychs predation more slowly than america but as violence mounted it swing into action going beyond us action the european union enacted asset freezes and visa bans on ukrainian evildoers chancellor merkel exercised leadership of the kind the german president called for at the munich security conference last month the eu dispatched three influential foreign ministers from france germany and poland to kyiv to mediate a solution their message shook yanukovych as with the 2011 libyan intervention america led successfully from within a coalition of allies the west is helping ukraine by engaging russias kremlin while also cautioning it on february 21 obama telephoned president vladimir putin to seek cooperation on a peaceful transition in ukraine in a february 23 phone call with the russian leader merkel obtained a pledge of support for ukraines territorial integrity implying that russia would not attempt to split off crimea or the eastern part of ukraine the same day national security adviser susan rice warned that russian military intervention would be a grave mistake thus far however it is unclear whether russia is doubling down on a bad bet the uprising in ukraine came after months of punitive russian trade embargoes and other intimidation aimed at scaring ukraine from moving closer to the european union and at keeping yanukovych in power this failed strategy united many otherwise fractious ukrainians and led russia to suffer its worst foreign policy defeat since independence in 1991 on february 24 prime minister dmitry medvedev falsely characterized the change in ukraine as the result of an armed mutiny such heated rhetoric suggests moscow may be readying its people for more direct intervention in ukraine the turn in kyiv has dealt a blow to the russiandominated eurasian customs union and to putins plans for a broader union beyond some members which chafe at the custom unions protectionism such as kazakhstan may become more restive russia is unlikely to separate eastern ukraine since 1991 it has shown no interest in attaching itself to russia which would swallow control of the region and its industry marginalizing some local elites talented young people in eastern ukraine see themselves as future europeans not future russians one sign of russias limited influence in the east of ukraine is the humiliation that befell yanukovych after he abandoned kyiv for his home region donetsk border authorities there refused to allow his aircraft to depart for russia yanukovych apparently then fled to safer ground in crimea where russia has greater sway the kremlins ambitions for crimea remain uncertain but are worrying ethnic russians comprise threefifths of the population and some are forming militias the speaker of crimeas parliament has spoken of possible secession a senior russian parliamentarian is in crimea claiming that his country will protect the interests of russians there the kremlin may view crimea as an analogue to abkhazia a russianoccupied separatist region of georgia crimea which hosts russias black sea fleet is of higher strategic importance for moscow the 2008 invasion of abkhazia and south ossetia provoked the greatest crisis in russias relations with the west since 1991 in 2009 when russian war propaganda was spinning up again the west made clear to the kremlin that further aggression in georgia would lead to a stronger western reaction russia backed off the west should clarify that russia would face sanctions if it were to use force in crimea to underline its resolve america should alter warship deployments in the black sea by rotating them to the western black sea in response to the announcement on february 26 that russian forces on ukraines eastern border are being put at the highest degree of combat readiness for an exercise the west should voice immediate concern in the united nations security council and share intelligence with ukraine on the russian maneuvers from an economic perspective ukraine has been living on borrowed time the government is almost bankrupt ukraine has the most energyinefficient economy in the world yanukovych obtained the promise of a 15 billion loan from moscow but without economic reforms ukraine may not have been able to repay its borrowing as new and more inclusive leaders and governance structures take shape in ukraine economic reform ought to receive top priority an urgent need is to end subsidies to domestic energy prices and to maintain an overvalued exchange rate in 1992 russian president boris yeltsin undertook shock therapy reforms which ever since have aided the economy the west hedged in criticizing their corrupt implementation however and many russians blamed the west for their impoverishment in pressing ukraines leaders to liberalize the economy in return for international aid the west and the imf ought to hold them accountable for transparent reforms and urge that leaders build wide stakeholder support for changes that will pain some ukrainians even as they boost overall productivity and exports the west can also help ukraine by returning and persuading others eg certain persian gulf states to return plunder that yanukovych and his cohorts stashed abroad some observers call for a western and imf counter to putins 15 billion bailout but political support for such levels of aid may be wanting ukrainian reforms will have to make the biggest contribution to restoring the government to sound financial footing the west should not raise undue expectations likewise although ukraine will accelerate its path westward hopes must be tempered ukraines per capita gdp measured by purchasing power parity is about half that of the eus poorest members bulgaria and romania many in the eu now have buyers remorse for having taken in these two countries so soon only thoroughgoing economic reforms over a decade or more could get ukraine fit to join the eu reminiscent of george kennan in opposing nato expansion eastward former national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski argues in the financial times that ukraine must have no participation in any antimoscow alliance ukrainians would view as betrayal any policy that denied them an opportunity to join nato ukrainian americans and their compatriots the influential central and east european coalition would excoriate any us leaders who backed such a policy so would senator john mccain russians would infer that the west was signaling that ukraine was fair game for intimidation ukraine has a way to go to become a stable and prosperous democracy as europe moves to secure more of its eastern flank the west should be ready for intensive engagement with and support for ukraine but also tough love on reform william courtney was us ambassador to kazakhstan and georgia and special assistant to the president for russia ukraine and eurasia gordonuacom the following was published in the blog of ukraines stellar journalist and premier interviewer dmytri gordon crimean legislator russias intervention in ukraine will be the empires last fart russia got entangled in the chechen war and still can not get out but there are only 700000 chechens whereas ukraine is a 46million country says leonid pilunsky a member of the verkhovna rada of crimea if russia tries to set its foot somewhere in ukraine it can only be in the crimea where else can poor russians get bombed by vicious banderovites everything is turned upside down russias interference in ukraine may become her last imperial fart this will be russias last diarrhea because they got entangled in the war in chechnya and still can not get out of it shooting never stops there but there are only 700 thousand chechens and ukrainians are 46 million of which 35 million have a genetic memory about as russiainflicted famines and wars that were destroying the ukrainian nation and now they will attempt to get into the crimea pilunsky wondered if russia thinks that the georgian scenario may work in the crimea they need to remember the population of kyiv alone is equal to that of the whole georgia a country like ukraine can not be gulped in like that and if they are going to cry out that russian blood may be shed then i can tell them that russian blood was shed already out of nearly 100 killed on maidan there were 20 russians who stood on the barricades against this moron yanukovych â whom those idiots are now defending nevertheless they still say it was the blood of banderovites said pilunsky the crimean legislator also emphasized that if russia chose to invade the crimea this would start an endless war that would be worse than in yugoslavia if russia moves in her troops this lead to a bloodbath all priests of the moscow patriarchate may get killed with bomb blasts to follow that war would go to infinity in comparison yugoslavia will look like a childrens amusement park believes pilunsky the russians can certainly do what the germans did â when they dressed in polish uniforms crossed the border and shot the garrison in gleiwitz but it should be remembered that it triggered world war ii or perhaps they will act like konrad henlein who appealed to hitler in order to annex the sudetenland alleging that czechs were killing the poor germans however six years later henlein was hanged ter six years geynleyna hanged remarked pilunsky cartoons window on eurasia window on eurasia is putin at risk of becoming a kerensky paul goble staunton february 26 â the russian media is reporting today that across the country various political organizations like rodina the eurasian union of youth and vladimir zhirinovskys liberal democratic party are organizing volunteers to be dispatched to ukraine to oppose the maidan in yezhednevny zhurnal aleksandr golts says that it isnt clear whether this is an initiative from below in response to russian commentaries on ukraine or whether someone in the kremlin has recalled the chinese experience during the korean war and wants to cover its interference in ukraine with socalled volunteers ejruanoteid24539 the moscow commentator says that he doesnt know which of these variants is worse on the one hand if it is a popular response to kremlin propaganda it may get out of hand because the russian authorities wont be able to stop it and on the other if the regime is playing this card it could leave it ever more dependent on the extremists but there is yet another precedent that the kremlin and its sympathizers should be worried about one implied but not discussed by golts and that is what happened when aleksandr kerensky the head of the provisional government called on the bolshevik red guards to help him put down what he saw as the threat from general lavr kornilov in 1917 kerenskys move may have stopped kornilov from seizing power but within weeks those on whom kerensky thought he could rely swept him and his regime from power that is a lesson that soviet leaders fully understood apparently putin is not or is so certain that as an effective manager he can avoid the consequences obviously the two situations are different in 1917 russia was in chaos and kerensky wanted to use armed groups against a domestic threat to his power now the russian state is far stronger and putin either directly or indirectly hopes to use such groups against the authorities in a neighboring country but when a leader reaches out beyond the duly constituted military and security forces and seeks to rely on armed groups from the population at large there are very real dangers that things can go very wrong very fast yet another indication of just how dangerous the current situation is not just for ukraine but for the russian federation and for its kremlin leader window on eurasia window on eurasia russians increasingly nostalgic for soviet system poll finds paul goble staunton february 27 â an increasing share of russians say they are nostalgic for the soviet system with the number indicating that they support for democracy and free markets or the political system they now live under has fallen in recent years according to the results of a new poll by the levada center asked whether they would like to live in a soviet political system in a western democratic one or in one like the current russian one 39 percent said they favored the soviet one up from 29 percent in 2012 and 19 percent said the current russian one down from 36 percent in 2008 twentyone percent favored democracy svpressarusocietyarticle82947 fiftyfour percent said they favored a planned economy only 29 percent down from 48 percent in 1992 said they backed a free market economy on the svobodnaya pressa portal yesterday svetlana gomzikova reported the explanations three moscow experts give for this turning away from democracy and free markets and back to the soviet system among russians yury latov an economist at the plekhanov russian economic university says that this pattern reflects the human tendency as people get older to view the past in rosy tones while forgetting the darker aspects of earlier times and to assume that the grass is greener wherever one is not both of these tendencies are exacerbated as the model in question recedes in time moreover he says such attitudes reflect the unwelcome fact that over the last 20 some years we have not been able to build an effective model of a market economy that failure too helps to explain why russians look back with nostalgia to the soviet system if russians remembered the soviet past more accurately or if they were able to be transferred back there by a time machine latov continues they would quickly ask to be returned even to russias far from perfect political and economic system because they would see that as bad as it is for many it is better for most than was the soviet one mikhail neyzhmakov the head of the moscow center for political research of the institute of globalization and social movements says that the attitudes revealed by the latest poll reflect changes in the information environment in which russians live our citizens today live in a completely different information environment than did they or their parents in the 1990s the russian media stressed what was wrong with the soviet past now this tonality has changed and the soviet past is presented as more favorable given their current problems many russians thus assume it was better another factor at work neyzhmakov suggests are the comments of those who are opposed to the putin regime they attack it so sharply that many russians are inclined to believe that the soviet system must have been better even though few in the opposition would want them to reach that conclusion but the underlying cause of this nostalgia he concludes is that democracy is something very new for russians and that many of them are supporters of a paternalistic system that takes care of them that leads to an idealization of a system that did so however poorly and means that support for paternalism will continue for a long time regardless of the state of the economy and academician oleg bogomolov suggests that for russians an ideal model would include equality justice and a socially oriented economy that is what russians want but this is not the soviet model whatever they believe instead it is a mixed economy one that could be described as a slightly modernized nep the new economic policy of the 1920s window on eurasia window on eurasia kremlin uncertain how to connect with rising generation sociologist says paul goble staunton february 27 â kremlin strategists now recognize that the themes of stability and modernization will not allow them to connect with the rising generation in russia as such ideas did in the last election with slightly older people but they have not yet figured out what themes they will try to use according to an expert at the public opinion foundation in an article on slonru yesterday larisa pautova says that the kremlins uncertainty in this regard reflects the fact that generational change is taking place increasingly quickly in russia and that the new generations are different from the ones immediately before them but similar to some earlier ones slonrurussianovoebrezhnevskoepokolenie1062007xhtml pautova suggests that young people who do not remember the soviet era are reacting to the new authoritarianism of the putin regime in a very different way than the slightly older group who do and who as a result are more inclined to back the modernizing ideas associated with dmitry medvedev the sociologist says that she uses the term generation in a quite arbitrary fashion to distinguish various cohorts among the young she calls those who finished school between 1977 and 1984 the suslov generation those who did so betweeen1985 and 1991 the gorbachev generation those who did between 1992 and 1999 the yeltsin generation those beginning in 2000 the putin generation and graduates from 2010 to 2014 the medvedev generation the suslov generation didnt believe in soviet ideals and felt sharply the need for freedom its gorbachev successor not only felt that need but achieved it both these cohorts have thus felt bad about the increasing authoritarianism in rusia because it has taken away the feeling of freedom and the possibilities with which they lied in their younger years those who entered adulthood as the yeltsin generation were very different from their predecessors they suffered from the crises of those years and members of this cohort highly value comfort and relative stability consequently they are much more supportive of the current regime in a certain respect pautova says this generation recalls the brezhnev one of 19691976 which grew up in the postwar period and benefited from the relatively welloff golden 1970s but now a generation is emerging which does not particularly remember the turbulence o the 1990s she says for them either putin or medvedev has always been president and they take relative economic stability as a given consequently this generation like the suslov one is appalled first and foremost by the rampant consumerism and cynicism of many russians in saying this pautova continues two qualifications are in order on the one hand far too little is known about this generation to justify as sweeping conclusion and on the other the new generation is deeply split between the 20 percent who follow public events and the 80 percent who only want to focus on their own lives in research conducted last year she says 51 percent of young people in russia between 18 and 30 said they were not keeping track of developments in ukraine and were largely indifferent to them and to what is going on in other neighboring countries despite the attention such events get in the state media pautova nonetheless believes that the new generation may make a difference she cites the findings of her colleague olga kryshtanovskaya who found growing dissatisfaction with the existing political system in russia not among young people in the capitals but also in the regions as well it is completely possible she suggests that this generation will have its own ideas about how the authorities need to be changed and she gives as an example research findings showing that among young people zhirinovsky is very popular and chauvinist attitudes are in general growing but how actively such young people will pursue these goals remains an open question many of them are actively involved in social networks where they create and even experience the illusion of activity with likes and reposts replacing genuine action an individual pushes a button and it seems to him that he has done something but this is not so window on eurasia window on eurasia crimean events could lead to dissolution of russia satarov says paul goble staunton february 27 â any further destabilization of crimea could easily become the first step toward the rapid disintegration of russia and mean that vladimir putin will pass into history not as he imagines as the leader who put a stop to its disintegration but rather as the terminator of russia according to georgy satarov as picked up from his facebook page by nr2ru satarov who is the president of the indem foundation says today that it is not clear who is behind the current efforts to destabilize crimea but that whoever it is by sowing the wind will reap a whirlwind in return nr2rumoskow486788html the moscow analyst says that in his view there are at a minimum three equally plausible explanations the first is that what is going on is part of putins program to restore russian domination over ukraine or at least over a portion of it this may seem absurd but it wouldnt be a first for putin satarov says the second possibility is that what is happening is the work of russian force structures who do not agree with putin such people could have various goals one would be to promote putins program but in ways he might be reluctant to follow another could be the playing out in foreign affairs of an internal political struggle that could isolate russia and lead to a criminalpolice dictatorship and the overthrow of the russian president and the third possible explanation according to satarov is that what is going on is the work of local crimean hawks who want to put before the russian authorities a fait accompli their goal he says would be the establishment of an independent state under the aegis of russia much like abkhazia or south osetia but whatever the explanation for the current exacerbation of tensions he argues the real threat of the current evolution of events in ukraines crimea will be far broader and could lead to the accelerated disintegration of russia and to the designation of putin as the terminator rather than the savior of russia and the russian people the wall street journal online the end of russias olympic truce on

and 10 days in jail on the charge of disobeying the authorities the arrest of mr nemtsov an elected regional assemblyman appears to be in direct violation of a russian law that limits prosecution of elected legislators moscows renewed crackdown heralds the end of a shortlived olympic reprieve which brought the release of a number of political prisoners its now a return to business as usual for the kremlin the intentionally harsh sentences for the bolotnaya square prisoners and the arrests of those who raised their voices on their behalf are meant to serve as a warning and to prevent the reemergence of street protests against mr putins corrupt and undemocratic rule it is no coincidence that this crackdown came days after the victory of a popular uprising against mr putins client regime in ukraineâa regime that tried to emulate the kremlins system of crony capitalism and authoritarian control vladimir putin it seems has drawn precisely the wrong lessons from the success of ukraines maidan movement the kremlin faults viktor yanukovych not for killing his own people but for not killing enough of them for weeks russian television stations have carried hatefilled appeals to crush the protesters in kiev russian prime minister dmitry medvedevs public advice to mr yanukovych was to not be a doormat people wipe their feet on all this has left little doubt as to the kremlins thinking in moscows view the events in ukraine amount to a westerninspired coup d Ã©tatâsimilar to the one that by the kremlins paranoid reasoning almost succeeded in russia during the mass protests of 2011 and 2012 hence the harsh sentences for the bolotnaya prisonersâa message that mr putin unlike mr yanukovych will not be a doormat for vladimir putin maintaining the status quo in ukraine was not primarily about preserving a postsoviet sphere of influence or recreating a moscowled empireâalthough such outcomes would have been added benefits his principal fear is that a democratic proeuropean ukraineâa country with similar cultural linguistic and religious traditionsâwill set a dangerous precedent for russia and that it will be only a matter of time before russian citizens begin to demand a similar level of political and economic freedom the uncomfortable truth for the kremlin is that the underlying reasons for ukraines uprising are also present in russia a recent survey by the independent pollster levada center showed that only 22 of russians want vladimir putin to remain president beyond his current termâa rather unimpressive figure for someone who controls the message on every single national television network even according to official numbers from the flawed 2012 presidential election mr putin has lost majority support in moscow kaliningrad vladimir omsk vladivostok and other major population centers across the country in the 2013 mayoral election in moscowâthe first important poll in years that had a semblance of competitionâmr navalny one of the opposition leaders arrested on monday came from nowhere to win 30 of the vote while russias traditionalist and less economically and technologically developed regions still provide mr putins party with votes educated modernized urban middleclass russians increasingly reject an archaic political system based on nepotism repression and international confrontation russias dynamic is in this way not unlike ukraines eastwest political divide a wise statesman would prepare for inevitable change by gradually expanding his countrys political space and allowing for increased competition both in the media and at the ballot box in opting for increased repression vladimir putinâwhile denouncing the uprising in ukraineâis doing everything to produce one in russia mr karamurza is a leader

And, as always, I urge you not to pass on the Russia section. NEWS\n\n UKRAINE’S NEW GOVERNMENT – Interim\n\n Financial Times - Armed men storm Crimea parliament building\n\n Clever little jump on the media and the world that has enough trouble figuring out what is going on. Armed pro-Russian men occupy the building of a generally pro-Russian legislative body and raise the Russia flag. Ok. Russians – not ethnic Russians, Russians are thick in Simferopol – remember Russia’s Black Sea Fleet is based in Sevastopol. So, what is the purpose of 50 – only 50?– armed men occupying the building and raising the flag? Simple – it is a deliberate provocation – a Russian provocation. It sends the message of Russian dominance and intention to control Ukraine. Apparently it also suggests – again – to the world a uncontrollable divide between the east and west of Ukraine but one ought to look at a map - - the only real way to define unique Crimea is “south” and Crimea has been a unique situation. So, a little recap, Putin has military maneuvers on the closest Russian border to Crimea, 50 armed men occupy a building in the Crimean capital and raise Russian flags - - - it is provocation clean and simple. And we issue warnings – thank you very much.\n\n Substanatively, however, what happened as a result of the armed occupation is clear: they 'helped' convene a session of the legislature that voted using cards belonging to absent deputies - 47 showed up when 51 are needed for a quorum - and voted to remove the Yanukovych appointed and Donetsk dominated government and appoint a pro-Russian politician as the new Crimean premier. Now, under Ukrainian law the president has to sign off on the dismissal and appointment of the premier. Interestingly, the head of the Crimean parliament allegedly explained that everything was done according to existing law because today's change of government was approved by... Yanukovych - who, according to his latest address to the Ukrainian people this morning, still considers himself the legitimate president and is supported in this fantasy by Russia. Yanukovych is scheduled to give a press conference tomorrow morning just across the border in Kryviy Rog. The Washington Post - Gunmen’s seizure of parliament building stokes tensions in Ukraine’s Crimea - Ukraine’s ousted leader remains defiant The story about the Crimean occupation is the same at that in the Financial Times above. But the story in the Post centers around Yanukovych who seems to have had a lot to say from some undisclosed location (with suggestions he is in Moscow). He still thinks of himself as president and calls the current government illegitimate, and he calls on the Ukrainian military to resist any orders to interfere in pro-Russian protests in eastern and southern Ukraine. In the article he doesn’t say anything about his concern for the safety of his peacocks or car collection.

By Courtney Weaver in Simferopol and Roman Olearchyk in Kiev\n\n ©Getty \n\n Scores of armed men calling for Crimea’s “unification with Russia” seized the regional parliament and government buildings early on Thursday morning, raising the stakes in an east-west struggle over Ukraine a day after ethnic Russians and Tatars clashed amid increasing tensions in the largely pro-Russian Ukrainian peninsula.\n\n The development comes amid fears that separatists could split Crimea from Ukraine after a pro-western leadership took over government in Kiev following last week’s toppling of the president, Viktor Yanukovich. \n\n The new government is due to be approved by parliament on Thursday after being presented to the street protesters in Kiev on Wednesday evening.\n\n One day after Russia flexed its military muscle by putting its army on alert, eyewitnesses in Crimea’s capital, Simferopol, said the men – armed with Kalashnikov rifles and grenades – swiftly raised Russian flags on the Crimean parliament and government buildings, a short walk from each other in the city centre.\n\n Leonid Khasanov, an activist who had been building a barricade at the Crimean parliament along with other pro-Russian supporters, described how some 50 armed men began descending on the building at around 5am. According to him they said: “The people should elect their own government.”\n\n He said the majority of them seemed to have a military background and were “Russians from Sevastopol”, the heavily pro-Russian port city on the peninsula where Russia’s Black Sea Fleet is stationed as part of a lease agreement with Ukraine’s government.\n\n Anatoly Mogilev, Crimea’s prime minister, tried to hold talks with the rebels but they refused to explain their action or negotiate, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported. \n\n It said that Vladimir Konstantinov, the Crimean parliament chairman and his deputies later entered the legislature after being invited by the gunmen to hold a session of lawmakers. It was not immediately clear what the armed men wanted lawmakers to do.\n\n Oleksandr Turchynov, Ukraine’s acting president, warned Russia not to deploy its forces stationed in the Sevastopol naval base in the crisis.\n\n “I appeal to the leadership of the Russian Federation’s Black Sea Fleet: all military personnel should remain on the territory [of the base in Sevastopol] as envisioned by agreements,” Mr Turchynov said on Thursday. “Any movement of armed forces beyond these borders will be interpreted as military aggression.” \n\n <div class=\"storyvideonojs\"><div><p>You need JavaScript active on your browser in order to see this video.</p><img alt=\"No video\" src=\"http://im.ft-static.com/m/img/logo/no_video.gif\" /></div></div>\n\n More video\n\n Nato defence ministers were meeting in Brussels on Thursday, with the crisis high on their agenda. Chuck Hagel, the US defence secretary, was expected to address Russia’s sabre rattling at the end of the day’s meetings, and Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the alliance’s secretary-general, cautioned the Kremlin against acting precipitously.\n\n “I’m concerned about developments in Crimea,” Mr Rasmussen wrote in a tweet as the meetings began. “I urge Russia not to take any action that can escalate tension or create misunderstanding.”\n\n Market action on Thursday suggests investors are becoming increasingly concerned about the potential for the crisis to trigger regional instability. The Swiss franc, considered a haven in times of geopolitical stress has risen to a 10-month high versus the euro. The Russian rouble is down 0.4 per cent versus the dollar to its weakest level since the height of the global financial crisis in 2009. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 stock index is down 0.4 per cent and US index futures are retreating.\n\n \n\n Speaking in Ukraine’s parliament, lawmaker Serhiy Kunitsin, a former Crimean prime minister, said that the “more than 120 armed men” who seized the peninsula’s parliament and government buildings were “professionally prepared.”\n\n “They have enough arms to defend [themselves] for one month,” he added.\n\n Ukraine’s general prosecutor’s office said it had classified the takeovers as “terrorist acts”.\n\n Some 42 per cent of Crimeans support unification with Russia, much higher than the 10-15 per cent backing it receives across Ukraine, Iryna Bekeshkina, head of Kiev’s Democratic Initiatives Foundation think-tank, said on Thursday.\n\n Arsen Avakov, Ukraine’s provisional interior minister, said the national guard and other police squads were being deployed to put down the uprising.\n\n Journalists who attempted to approach the building retreated after hearing a loud bang.\n\n In a statement, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, the newly appointed head of Ukraine’s SBU state security service, said Ukraine was regularly informing all UN Security Council members – which he described as “guarantors of Ukraine’s territorial integrity” – about the swiftly developing situation in Crimea, including Russia, the US, UK, France and China.\n\n Additional reporting by Peter Spiegel in Brussels and Jamie Chisholm in London By Will England and William Booth, Updated: Thursday, February 27, 4:49 AM E-mail the writers KIEV, [sic KYIV] Ukraine — Viktor Yanukovych, the ousted president of Ukraine, has asked for and received a security guarantee from Russia, news agencies reported from Moscow [my emphasis RAM]\n\n Yanukovych still considers himself the rightful president of Ukraine, according to a statement distributed to Russian news organizations, and believes that his opponents have violated a deal reached last Friday that would have allowed him to remain in office until a presidential election could be held in December.\n\n Over the weekend, after he fled Kiev, the Ukrainian parliament voted to remove him from office and scheduled elections for May 25.\n\n In his statement Yanukovych said the current government is illegitimate, and he called on the Ukrainian military to resist any orders to interfere in pro-Russian protests in eastern and southern Ukraine. Tensions in Simferopol, the capital of the Crimea, were heightened Thursday when a band of armed men seized two government buildings.\n\n Yanukovych’s whereabouts are not clear, though a Russian newspaper, RBK, reported Wednesday that he had arrived in Moscow the day before.\n\n Russian wire services quoted unnamed government spokesmen as saying that his security would be guaranteed as long as he in on Russian soil.\n\n Ukrainian authorities want him tried by the International Criminal Court in the Hague, and have put him on the wanted list for charges of “mass murder.” Almost 90 people died in clashes between protesters and police while Yanukovych was in power. Russia apparently intends not to comply with any Ukrainian request to turn him over – if in fact he is in Russia now.\n\n “I officially declare my determination to fight until the end for the implementation of the important compromise agreements concerning the Ukrainian recovery from the profound political crisis,” Yanukovych said.\n\n The group of armed men that seized the local parliament and the regional government headquarters in Simferopol early Thursday morning barricaded themselves inside both buildings and raised Russian flags, according to Ukraine’s new interior minister.\n\n “Obviously, the people in southeastern Ukraine and Crimea are refusing to accept the anarchy and actual lawlessness in the country where ministers are elected by the mob on a square,” Yanukovych’s statement said. That was a reference to the selection of a new cabinet on Wednesday evening in Kiev, after interim authorities had conferred with a self-organized council of protesters on Independence Square.\n\n The men were reported to be wearing plain uniforms without designating marks. The Interfax news agency quoted a local authority as saying the men were from a Crimean self-defense group. Local reporters said the men threw flash grenades at them.\n\n “Measures have been taken to counter extremist actions and not allow the situation to escalate into an armed confrontation in the center of the city,” said Ukraine’s Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, whose responsibilities include state security. He said the occupied buildings were being sealed off by police.\n\n In Kiev, Ukraine’s interim president, Oleksandr Turchynov, warned Russia that any movement of military personnel off the leased Black Sea naval base in Sevastopol “will be viewed as military aggression.”\n\n Speaking in the Verkhovna Rada, or parliament, on Thursday, he said, “Ukrainian enemies should not try to destabilize the situation, should not encroach on our independence, sovereignty, and territory.”\n\n Then, following three months of protests during which opponents of Yanukovych occupied public buildings in Kiev and in cities across Ukraine, he declared: “Any attempts to seize administrative buildings will be viewed as a crime against the Ukrainian state.”\n\n NATO defense ministers in Brussels will meet Thursday with Ukraine’s acting defense chief. Responding to morning reports from Crimea, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen in a Twitter post urged Russia “not to take any action that can escalate tension or create misunderstanding.”\n\n The takeover, in the regional capital of Simferopol, brings tensions in the Crimea to a new high, just hours after thousands of ethnic Russians there had protested against the new government in Kiev, while Crimean Tatars rallied in its support. It also came after Moscow ordered surprise military exercises in a district bordering Ukraine and put troops in the region on high alert.\n\n The developments stoked concerns about divided loyalties in Ukraine and raised the question of Russian military intervention, which Secretary of State John F. Kerry said would be a “grave mistake.” Russia insisted that the exercises were routine.\n\n In the aftermath of Ukraine’s toppling of its Kremlin-backed president, Viktor Yanukovych, eyes turned toward the Crimean Peninsula, where ties to Russia are especially strong and where the fallen protesters in Kiev are viewed not as heroes but as hooligans.\n\n While the demonstrations have quieted in Kiev — the protest council called on members of “self-defense” groups to remove their ski masks and put down their weapons — they are just beginning here in the Crimea. In the regional capital, Simferopol, pro-Russia demonstrators clashed with thousands of Muslim Tatars who were rallying in support of the interim pro-Europe government in Kiev.\n\n Police mostly succeeded in keeping the two sides apart, though fists were thrown as the two groups staged dueling rallies outside the regional parliament. A dozen people were injured, and one elderly man died of a heart attack at the demonstration.\n\n The Tatars, who as a people were deported to Asia by Joseph Stalin after World War II and who returned to their ancestral homeland only in the 1980s, are Russian speakers who strongly oppose the idea of joining Russia.\n\n Elsewhere in Ukraine, there were some signs of reconciliation. In the fervently anti-\n\n Yanukovych city of Lviv, in the Ukrainian-speaking west, activists organized a campaign to have everyone there speak Russian for the day. In Odessa and in Donetsk, Yanukovych’s home town, there was a move to have residents and businesses use only Ukrainian for a day.\n\n The most independent television company in the country, Channel 5, which came to be identified with the protests, announced that it will now present the evening news in Russian.\n\n The country’s interim authorities presented their list of nominees for a new cabinet, to be headed by Arseniy Yatsenyuk, one of the three political leaders who helped maintain the protest movement over the course of the past three months. Neither of the other two — Vitali Klitschko, a former boxing champion who is running for president in a May election, or Oleh Tiahnybok, a member of the nationalist All-Ukrainian Union “Svoboda” party — was on the list.\n\n The roster was approved in consultations with a self-organized council of protesters from the Maidan, or Kiev’s Independence Square, but was greeted with little enthusiasm by the thousands gathered there.\n\n “Too many politicians. We don’t trust anyone,” said Svetlana Kravtsova, 50. “We need to see real people.”\n\n Parliament plans to confirm the list Thursday. The move comes amid concerted efforts to secure foreign aid, with the Ukrainian currency dipping to a new low.\n\n Military drills at issue \n\n Moscow’s military exercises — which, intentionally or not, are a stark reminder of Russia’s armed power — were announced by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. He said the maneuvers were not related to Ukraine’s turmoil but were ordered by President Vladimir Putin to check preparedness “for action in crisis situations that threaten the nation’s military security.”\n\n The exercises, due to start Friday and last four days, will also involve elements of the Russian navy and air force, Shoigu said. Russia’s Black Sea naval fleet is at a leased base here in Sevastopol’s deep-water harbor.\n\n In Brussels, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that the alliance had been informed of the exercises and that the Russians had “lived up to all their obligations as regards transparency.”\n\n Russia has held at least six such snap exercises in the past year to test readiness, the RIA Novosti news agency said.\n\n The exercises, Shoigu said, involve the western military district, which abuts Ukraine’s northeastern border, and units of the central district, which covers a vast swath across the middle of Russia. The district closest to the Crimea is not involved.\n\n Russian officials have said their country has no intention of intervening militarily in Ukraine. Valentina Matvienko, speaker of the upper house of the Russian parliament, said Wednesday that intervention was out of the question.\n\n In a brief news conference in Brussels on Wednesday, Rasmussen made no direct mention of the Russian exercises but said, “We take it for granted that all nations respect the sovereignty and independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and this is a message that we have also conveyed to whom it may concern.” He made the remarks as NATO defense ministers assembled for a scheduled meeting.\n\n Although Ukraine has not sought NATO membership, it has long cooperated with the alliance’s operations, sending troops to Bosnia and Afghanistan and participating in NATO anti-\n\n piracy operations off the coast of Somalia.\n\n Ukraine’s acting defense minister is expected to attend a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission on Thursday.\n\n A city loyal to Russia \n\n Sevastopol embraced news of the Russian military exercises and took them as a sign of saber rattling and support.\n\n Sevastopol looks, sounds and feels like a little corner of Russia, and activists here have declared that it will remain that way, no matter what happens in the rest of Ukraine.\n\n “We have our Russian language, Russian heroes and Russian culture,” said Valeriy Bespalko, who stood in the drizzling rain earlier in the day to support the city’s new de facto mayor, who is a Russian, not Ukrainian, citizen and who took over City Hall two days ago.\n\n Hours after the new Ukrainian interior minister announced Wednesday that he would disband the elite police force that spearheaded most of the attacks on protesters in Kiev last week, its members were offered sanctuary here in the Crimea, further stoking concerns about divided loyalties and old schisms in turbulent Ukraine.\n\n “These people adequately fulfilled their duty to the country and have shown themselves to be real men,” said Alexey Chaly, the new head of the Coordinating Council of Sevastopol.\n\n Chaly said the police unit had been “abandoned to the mercy of this rabid pack of Nazis,” a reference to the protesters in Kiev.\n\n “At this difficult time, our city needs decent men who could form the basis of self-defense groups and, in the future, the municipal police. We are ready to provide for them if they join us in our struggle, and to offer safety to their families,” he said in a post on his Facebook page.\n\n The special police unit, known as the “Berkut,” was reviled by the protesters in Kiev after attacks that included the use of live ammunition. Dismantling such units can be difficult business. A similar outfit, the Latvia OMON, was disbanded in 1991, and its members became the backbone of organized crime in St. Petersburg.\n\n Englund reported from Kiev.

Russia has previously violated its obligations under this agreement with only deafening silence from the other signatory countries. \n\n Recent reports in the press have indicated that Russia intends to continue its economic and military coercion of Ukraine with the aim \n\n of splitting the country. It is time for the United States and the European Union to finally stand up and defend their own principles and \n\n fulfill the commitments they made to Ukraine. If they do not, the risk of overall conflagration in Europe is real, with not only regional \n\n but global instability resulting. If they do not, their credibility will vaporize, fueling even further dangers. Towards this end, the following actions must be immediately taken by the US and the EU. \n\n · Issue forthright public statements to Russia – without delay and without mincing words – that it must stop advocating violence \n\n against Ukraine or agitating for its division or separatism. \n\n If such actions by Russia should continue in any form, then the United States and the EU must forthwith: \n\n · The US must act upon its obligations under the \"United States – Ukraine Charter On Strategic Partnership Agreement\" of \n\n December 19, 2008 and the various Ukraine - NATO Cooperation agreements. \n\n · Freeze Russia's application to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \n\n · Expel Russia from all G-8 conferences and other international economic forums. \n\n · Bring punitive actions against Russia within the rules of World Trade Organization [WTO] for Russia's repeated violations of \n\n WTO rules by its aggressive economic behavior towards Ukraine. \n\n · The EU should intensify its scrutiny of Gazprom's behavior in the European gas market and strongly pursue a pending antitrust \n\n complaint. \n\n · Expand Magnitsky sanctions on Russian government officials and their assets in the US. The EU should also freeze Russian \n\n government officials' assets and reject the pending Russian request for visa-free travel for holders of \"official\" passports. \n\n · Use the forum of the United Nations to condemn any aggressive Russian behavior vis-à-vis Ukraine. If there are signs of military \n\n intervention by Russian forces in Ukraine, to immediately call upon the UN to send UN observers and/or a UN peacekeeping \n\n force to prevent and rollback any Russian military incursion into Ukraine.

The US on Wednesday warned Russia against a military intervention in Ukraine, saying such a move would be a “grave mistake,” as troops in western Russia were placed on high alert for massive new war games in the area, including near the Russian-Ukrainian border. In delivering the blunt message, John Kerry also announced the Obama administration was planning $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine and would consider additional direct assistance for the former Soviet republic following unrest that led to the ouster of its Russian-backed president. WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday warned Russia against a military intervention in Ukraine, saying such a move would be a “grave mistake,” as troops in western Russia were placed on high alert for massive new war games in the area, including near the Russian-Ukrainian border.\n\n In delivering the blunt message, Secretary of State John Kerry also announced that the Obama administration was planning $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine and would consider additional direct assistance for the former Soviet republic following unrest that led to the ouster of its Russian-backed president.\n\n Kerry also renewed U.S. demands that Moscow withdraw troops from disputed enclaves in another former Soviet republic, Georgia, and urged Georgia to further integrate with Europe and NATO.\n\n The warning, aid announcement and nudge westward for Georgia all came amid growing tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine and were likely to fuel already-heightened Russian suspicions over Western intentions in its backyard.\n\n Kerry insisted, however, that that U.S. policy toward Ukraine, Georgia and the other states that once made up the Soviet Union was not aimed at reducing Russia’s influence in its neighborhood. Instead, he maintained that U.S. encouragement for former Soviet states to integrate with the West was driven by America’s desire to see their people realize aspirations for freedom in robust democracies with strong economies.\n\n “This is not ‘Rocky IV’,” Kerry said, referring to the iconic 1985 Sylvester Stallone film in which an aging American boxer takes on a daunting Soviet muscleman. “It is not a zero-sum game. We do not view it through the lens of East-West, Russia-U.S. or anything else. We view it as an example of people within a sovereign nation who are expressing their desire to choose their future. And that’s a very powerful force.”\n\n Noting that Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday ordered large-scale military exercises in what many see as a show of force or possible prelude to intervention in Ukraine, Kerry said it would be hypocritical for Moscow to send troops into another country after spending the last several years opposing foreign military action in places like Libya and Syria.\n\n “For a country that has spoken out so frequently in the last year ... against foreign intervention in Libya, Syria, elsewhere, it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of Ukraine.” Kerry said. “Any kind of military intervention that would violate the sovereign territorial integrity of Ukraine would be a huge, a grave mistake. And the territorial integrity of Ukraine needs to be respected.”\n\n White House spokesman Josh Earnest urged “outside actors” to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty. Without specifically mentioning Russia, Earnest also called on others in the region to end “provocative rhetoric and actions.”\n\n On assistance, Kerry said it was “urgent to move forward” to help Ukraine but also said it was urgent for Ukraine’s interim authorities to enact reforms, curb corruption, and prepare free and fair elections. He said the planned $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees would be accompanied by additional aid to be determined later in consultation with Congress, as well as about $1.5 billion from the European Union, along with loans from global financial institutions.\n\n Kerry made the comments in a round-table interview with a small group of reporters at the State Department where he presided over a meeting of the U.S.-Georgia Strategic Partnership Commission earlier Wednesday.\n\n At that meeting, he announced additional, but unspecified, U.S. assistance “to help support Georgia’s European and Euro-Atlantic vision.” And he denounced Russia’s continued military presence in the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in violation of the cease-fire that ended the 2008 Russia-Georgia conflict.\n\n He stressed that the U.S. supports Georgia’s membership in NATO — something opposed by Russia — and wants to see it sign a partnership agreement with the European Union later this year. A similar proposed agreement between Ukraine and the E.U. was among the catalysts that led to the deadly unrest in Kiev that unseated Russian-backed President Viktor Yanukovych last week.\n\n Some Russian officials accuse the West of being behind the revolt against Yanukovych. U.S. and European officials have denied such allegations.\n\n In addition to Putin ordering the military exercises, Russia’s defense ministry said it would take steps to strengthen security at facilities of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, where there have been clashes between pro- and anti-Russian demonstrators. Pro-Russian protesters have spoken of secession, and a Russian lawmaker has stoked their passions by promising that Russia will protect them.\n\n Those steps have raised fears of possible Russian military intervention in Ukraine along the lines of its 2008 operation in Georgia, which led to the occupations of Abkhazia and South Ossetia and was roundly condemned by the United States and its European allies.\n\n Kerry, sitting next to Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili, affirmed that the U.S. “remains steadfast in our support for Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”\n\n “We continue to object to Russia’s occupation, militarization and borderization of Georgian territory, and we call on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the 2008 cease-fire agreement, including the withdrawal of forces and free access for humanitarian assistance,” Kerry said. By Roman Olearchyk in Kiev\n\n ©Reuters \n\n Arseny Yatseniuk\n\n Arseniy Yatseniuk is poised to become the next prime minister of Ukraine, putting him at the head of a government that faces deepening political, economic and geopolitical challenges following last weekend’s ousting of Viktor Yanukovich.\n\n The candidature of Mr Yatseniuk – an ally of Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister who was released hours after Mr Yanukovich was swept from power – was revealed to thousands of protesters massed on Kiev’s main square as darkness fell on Wednesday. Many were holding a candlelit vigil to mourn the death of nearly 100 people killed by sniper fire during clashes with police last week.\n\n Still manning the barricades and guarding buildings on Kiev’s main street they had seized in an effort to show they are still a force to be reckoned with, the crowds gave a lukewarm reception to Mr Yatseniuk’s name. Parliament is expected to uphold his appointment in a vote on Thursday.\n\n “This government is fated to serve only three to four months as it will need to take some unpopular decisions,” Oleksandr Turchynov, acting president, told the throng as the names of Mr Yatseniuk and other putative senior members of the new administration were announced.\n\n The country’s business community was more enthusiastic. “Yatseniuk is a very experienced politician with understanding of what business needs and of the global financial markets,” said Tomas Fiala, president of the Kiev-based European Business Association and founder of investment bank Dragon Capital.\n\n Business leaders are also supportive of calls by Kiev’s latest leaders to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, as well as turning away from Russian backing and influence and towards the signing of association and free trade agreements with the EU.\n\n Despite being only 39, Mr Yatseniuk has already served as acting central bank chief, foreign minister, economy minister and chairman of parliament. He was also deputy head of the presidential administration during Viktor Yushchenko’s term as president in 2005-10.\n\n He also has the respect of EU and US officials. In an otherwise embarrassing leak three weeks ago of a recording between Victoria Nuland, a US assistant secretary of state, and the US ambassador to Ukraine, the US officials were heard to support Mr Yatseniuk as the opposition leader best equipped for government.\n\n Other names proposed to the crowd included:\n\n * Oleksandr Shlapak, a former banker and senior official in Mr Yushchenko’s administration, as finance minister;\n\n * Pavlo Sheremeta, a business school academic who has held advisory roles to the government of Malaysia, as economy minister;\n\n * Olya Bohomolets, a doctor who treated injured protesters in makeshift hospitals, as deputy prime minister in charge of humanitarian affairs;\n\n * Dmytro Bulatov, a protest leader who was abducted and tortured for days, as sports minister.\n\n A new anti-corruption bureau will be chaired by investigative journalist Tetyana Chornovol.\n\n Vitali Klitschko, the heavyweight boxer and leader of the Udar party, decided to stay out of the administration and focus on campaigning for the May 25 snap presidential election. It is not yet clear if Ms Tymoshenko, who is seeking medical treatment in Germany, will also run for president.\n\n Petro Poroshenko, the only billionaire who dared to back the protests openly, is expected to challenge Mr Klitschko.\n\n In a bid to appease protesters demanding an end to government corruption, Mr Yatseniuk’s cabinet will have civic activists to oversee it. Andriy Parubiy, a lawmaker who served as commander of the protest movement’s guards, was chosen to serve as chair of the national security and defence council. Victoria Siumar, a civil society activist, and Dmytro Yarosh, head of Right Sector, a militant protest group, were proposed as his deputies.\n\n One of the administration’s first tasks will be to bring to justice members of Mr Yanukovich’s government who fled last weekend. Warrants for their arrest were issued this week but the whereabouts of many senior politicians and officials is not known.\n\n “The country is facing serious economic challenges in this crisis ... and most likely a lot of money was stolen,” a western banker in Kiev said.\n\n “This revolution gives new hope and I am positive on the country in the long-term view. [The new government must] bring the criminals to justice and seize their assets. It should try to recover as much money as possible – they will need it.” Window on Eurasia: Ukraine is as Ukrainian as the Russian Federation is Russian Staunton, February 27 – Despite the frequent appearance of maps showing a large swatch of Ukraine being ethnic Russian, Ukraine in terms of the ethnic composition of its population is almost exactly as Ukrainian as the Russian Federation is Russian. Moreover, none of Ukraine is defined as an ethnic autonomy while nearly half of the territory of the Russian Federation is. As Rashit Akhmetov, the editor of “Zvezda Povolzhya,” points out in the new issue of his Kazan weekly, 77 percent of the population of Ukraine consists of ethnic Ukrainians according to the latest census. In the Russian Federation, 80 percent of the population consists of ethnic Russians (no. 7, February 27, 2014, p. 1). Given various problems with the censuses especially in Russia where various experts have suggested there was an over-count of several million ethnic Russians (along with an over-count of slightly fewer non-Russians in the North Caucasus), that puts the two countries in a statistical dead heat as far as ethnic homogeneity is concerned. Moreover, Ukraine does not have even nominally ethno-federalism: its only autonomy is Crimea which is explicitly defined in non-ethnic terms. Russia in contrast has 21 autonomous ethnic republics, and before Vladimir Putin began his amalgamation program, they formed 53 percent. Now, they form slightly less than half of the territory. Consequently, if Moscow and Western commentators who routinely draw a picture of Ukraine as if it were almost equally and deeply divided between a Ukrainian center and west and a Russian east were to prepare analogous ethnic maps for the Russian Federation, the latter country would look to be a better candidate for coming apart than is Ukraine. At present, Akhmetov points out, there are seven million ethnic Russians in Ukraine alongside 41 million ethnic Ukrainians. And in the eastern parts of the country where many assume ethnic Russians dominate, ethnic Ukrainians do in most. Thus, 70 percent of the population of Kharkhiv oblast is ethnically Ukrainian, and 57 percent of Odessa oblast is as well. It is true, the Kazan editor acknowledges, that the eastern oblast overwhelmingly vote for the party of power, just as ethnic Russians in Russia tend to do. But the ethnic Russians in both places will do so even if the party of power changes. As soon as one party of power loses to another, this portion of the population will follow. “In the USSR,” he recalls, “there were 16 million communists,” but their power and their support disappeared “over the course of three days.” “The myth of the pro-Russia orientation of the eastern oblasts of Urkaine is one thought u by Moscow propaganda,” Akhmetov says. These regions “are not seeking to unite with Russia,” and not just because 70 percent of the population of these regions is ethnically Ukrainian. It is because “they want to live in Ukraine” and not in Putin’s Russia. It is certainly true, he continues, that ethnic Russians in eastern Ukraine do not like what Moscow is describing as “fascists” and “bandits.” But neither do Ukrainians. And the Kazan editor says that he ‘suspects that there are more fascists in Russia today than there are ‘Banderites’ in Ukraine. Akhmetov’s own republic, Tatarstan, he says, has been interested in European integration since the 1990s. Indeed, that republic’s president at the time, Mintimir Shaymiyev declared that his strategic goals was “to transform Tatarstan into a model European region of Russia.” According to the editor, “the first steps of the ‘Europeanization’ of Russia are completely possible in Tatarstan. The republic should receive the status of ‘a free European political zone,’” and it should be possible to locate certain European institutions in Kazan, such as a branch of the European Human Rights Court. Russia would benefit from this, Akhmetov argues; it will not benefit and will be harmed “by a confrontation with Europe.” But the Moscow media suggest that many in the Russian capital do not understand this and do not recognize that it cannot rely on force or its own Black Hundreds organizations and hope to both remain in power and to modernize the country. If Putin changes course at home and in relations with Europe, he could become “a major historical figure like Peter the Great.” But if he does not, the future for him and his country – and one should add the countries around it and the world – will be far, far bleaker. Inside the Ring: All eyes on Moscow’s military moves in Ukraine By Bill Gertz\n\n -\n\n U.S. intelligence agencies are stepping up their spying on Russia’s military amid concerns that Moscow is preparing to use force against Ukraine in the wake of the pro-democracy revolution in Kiev.\n\n Earlier this week, intelligence agencies reported that two Ural-4320 trucks full of armed Russian troops were observed arriving in the Black Sea port of Yalta. Photographs made by a Ukrainian civilian were posted online as the troop transports entered a Russian military facility in Yalta, on the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine.\n\n Other activities in recent days have included the movement of armored personnel carriers observed at Russia's Black Sea Fleet headquarters in nearby Sevastopol.\n\n U.S. officials said the purpose of the troops is not known, but speculation centers on the possibility of the troops being used as part of an advance force for a future Russian military operation.\n\n U.S. intelligence agencies also are tracking possible covert infiltration of Russian Spetsnaz commandos. One concern is that Moscow will provoke a conflict by using the undercover commandos to attack ethnic Russians and then launch an invasion under the guise of protecting those Russians.\n\n \n\n Some 8 million Russians reside in Ukraine, making up about 17 percent of the population.\n\n Tensions remain high between Moscow and Kiev [sic KYIV] over the recent ouster of Ukraine’s pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovych, who now is being sought on murder charges.\n\n In a sign of Moscow’s concern over losing what it regards as a strategic neighbor, President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian forces on a higher state of alert Tuesday. The mobilization includes forces some 200 miles from Russia’s southern border with Ukraine.\n\n The mobilization could indicate a future military operation, although Moscow's Defense Ministry said the troop movements are not related to the unrest in Ukraine.\n\n The Obama administration has issued indirect warnings to Russia not to intervene militarily, the latest signal made by Deputy Secretary of State William Burns during a visit Tuesday to Kiev.\n\n “We strongly support Ukraine’s territorial integrity and its unity,” Mr. Burns told reporters at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev.\n\n Asked about the Russian military activities in the Crimea, and how far the United States is prepared to go to prevent military intervention, Mr. Burns said: “All that I would stress is what I said before, and that is that the United States strongly supports the unity and the territorial integrity of Ukraine.”\n\n Mr. Burns said speculation over splitting Ukraine into pro-Russian and pro-European regions “is not in Ukraine’s interest.”\n\n “And the United States will continue to reinforce that very firm position,” he said.\n\n • Contact Bill Gertz at @BillGertz. US stakes in Ukraine tied to location, location \n\n WASHINGTON — Ukraine isn't typically a U.S. foreign policy priority, experts say. President Barack Obama is more occupied with Syria, Iran, Afghanistan and more. His administration rejects the notion that the situation in Ukraine represents some kind of epic East vs. West power struggle.\n\n Still, there are reasons why Americans should care about what's happening there, starting with location, location, location.\n\n 1. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD. Sure, it would be nice for Ukraine to have a stable, democratic government simply because that's a good thing, and no one wants to see more bloodshed. But the U.S. is more concerned about Ukraine because of its location, perched between Russia and the rest of Europe, where the U.S. has lots of friends. \"The U.S. has an interest in a wider, stable, secure Europe,\" says Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who's now at the Brookings Institution. \"If Ukraine goes into chaos, that's likely to pull those European countries in — and we may get involved later on, too.\"\n\n 2. BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MARCH OF DEMOCRACY. The overthrow of Kiev's democratically elected (but corrupt and repressive) government by protesters seeking a more just Ukraine raises unsettling questions. \"Ukraine doesn't fit this ideal model of how democratic change progresses,\" says Olga Oliker, associate director of RAND Corp.'s international security and defense policy center. \"What does it mean to try to create more democratic systems in nondemocratic ways?\"\n\n 3. LOOKING OUT FOR A FRIEND. Ukraine's actually been a good friend to the U.S. since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. It was once home to the world's third-largest nuclear weapons arsenal, and voluntarily surrendered the stockpile to Russia. It sent troops to help out in Iraq in 2003-05 and dispatched peacekeepers to Kosovo and Lebanon. It agreed to cancel a planned $45 million nuclear deal with Iran in 1992. \"On a lot of foreign policy issues, they've been fairly helpful, and I would argue that that is one reason why we ought to care about what is going on,\" Pifer says.\n\n 4. RUSSIA. The unrest in Ukraine could complicate U.S.-Russian relations. The Obama administration dismisses the idea of competing spheres of influence as wildly outmoded and deliberately has tried not to insert itself too deeply in the situation. But Russian President Vladimir Putin very much wants to tilt Ukraine his direction. \"The U.S.-Russian relationship has been very combative lately and scratchy,\" says Andrew Weiss, a Clinton administration expert on Ukraine and Russia who's now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Ukraine adds one more layer on top of the problems that already exist.\"\n\n 5. PEOPLE. BUSINESS. MONEY. People: There's obvious concern among the estimated 1 million to 1.5 million people of Ukrainian descent in the U.S., with large concentrations in Chicago, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Sacramento, Calif., and the New York City area. Business: Ukraine, an economic mess, is not a big U.S. trading partner. But there's plenty of commercial potential in a country of 46 million people. Money: Ukraine is in dire need of billions of dollars in financial assistance. The main lender is likely to be the International Monetary Fund. But Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday the U.S. plans to provide $1 billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine and will consider additional direct assistance. IMF to Send Mission to Kiev [sic KYIV], Likely to Require Tough Conditions for Aid By \n\n Andrey Ostroukh in Moscow, \n\n Ian Talley in Washington and \n\n Laurence Norman in Brussels \n\n Updated Feb. 27, 2014 2:41 p.m. ET\n\n Ukraine's new government on Thursday set in motion requests for international financial assistance as it attempts to cement its standing following the removal of the country's president over the weekend.\n\n The move comes amid growing pressure on the Ukrainian government's finances with the currency falling sharply in recent days and foreign exchange reserves declining.\n\n Ukraine hopes to secure a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, Russia and other countries willing to offer aid. Ukraine's newly appointed finance minister Oleksandr Shlapak on Thursday said the government will seek at least $15 billion in aid from the IMF. The IMF separately said it received a bailout request from Ukraine and will send a team to Kiev soon to undertake negotiations.\n\n \"We are ready to respond and in the coming days will send an IMF fact-finding mission team to Kiev to undertake a preliminary dialogue with authorities,\" IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said in a written statement.\n\n Ms. Lagarde said the IMF is in talks with other countries as part of a larger financing package. Ukraine's finances are on the verge of collapse after the ouster of former pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. \n\n The IMF aid request came shortly after an interim government was appointed in Ukraine.\n\n Mr. Shlapak also said that the newly appointed government will continue talks with Russia about credit line extensions and a discount on gas supplies, with the goal of reaching agreements in early March.\n\n Ukraine is seeking aid to help it pay existing foreign debt, finance reforms and stabilize its currency, the hryvnia. Officials engaged in discussions with Ukraine said the country needs $4 billion immediately. By the end of 2015, Ukraine hopes to raise some $35 billion.\n\n The European Union and the U.S. are exploring aid packages—both short-term assistance and larger longer-term aid—but some of the assistance will likely be linked to an IMF loan deal being agreed upon first.\n\n \"We are looking to provide immediate assistance for urgent needs in the next couple months, in close cooperation with an IMF reform package. In the medium term we will also look into combined international efforts in support of bigger reform programs,\" a senior EU diplomat said.\n\n Among the short-term options under review by the U.S. and EU are small bilateral bridge loans, loan guarantees and a short-term emergency credit line from the IMF that isn't tied to the strict conditions a large-scale bailout requires.\n\n The IMF chief said the Washington-based lender would first make a technical assessment of the economic situation and Ukraine's needs and start discussing with Ukraine's transitional government \"the policy reforms that could form the basis of a Fund-supported program.\"\n\n The IMF has said it would require tough conditions for any bailout because of the failure of Kiev to live up to previous financing program requirements. U.S. and European officials have said they would also require conditions.\n\n IMF spokesman Gerry Rice at a Thursday press briefing said Kiev has indicated it will commit to wide-ranging reforms as part of its bailout request. Mr. Rice said he couldn't address possible timing of an IMF bailout or whether the fund would consider a short-term emergency credit line while a large-scale program is negotiated.\n\n The IMF has previously pushed for Kiev to depreciate its currency, phase out fuel subsidies and tighten it government spending.\n\n On Wednesday U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington could provide some $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine to help the economy. The EU is also exploring a number of steps—from possible financial assistance to help with energy security and improved market access—in parallel to an IMF-led international package. EU officials say, however, that the bloc can only unlock a boosted-up financial lifeline, which could reach around €1 billion, once some kind of IMF program is in place.\n\n Mr. Yanukovych was in talks with the IMF for much of last year concerning extending a loan program but he rejected the Washington-based lender's demands that Ukraine cut energy subsidies and devalue its currency.\n\n The EU has also said it hopes to bring Russia on board as part of an international assistance package. Russia agreed a $15 billion loan for Ukraine in December after Mr. Yanukovych abandoned a broad economic and political agreement with the EU. However it has put that assistance on hold following Mr. Yanukovych's ouster.\n\n Write to Andrey Ostroukh at This e-mail address is being protected from spambots.

Yanukovych released a statement Thursday saying that he remained the lawful president of Ukraine and appealed to Russia to protect “my personal safety.” While his precise whereabouts remained a mystery, Russian news agencies reported subsequently that Mr. Yanukovych would hold a news conference on Friday in Rostov-on-Don, a city in southern Russia, six days after he was driven from power by mass protests and fled from Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.\n\n “Everyone now needs to step back and avoid any kind of provocations over Ukraine,” said Mr. Kerry, who said that he had proposed that the United States and Russia try to cooperate on easing tensions there.\n\n In the Crimean regional capital, Simferopol, local police officers sealed off access to the government buildings, including the regional Parliament, which were seized in mysterious overnight raids by people who appeared to be militant ethnic Russians. A spokeswoman for the speaker, Vladimir Konstantinov, said that Parliament had voted to hold a referendum on greater autonomy on May 25, the scheduled date of a presidential election.\n\n Crimea has been a source of tension between Ukraine and Russia for decades: the territory was transferred to Ukraine by the Russian Federation when they were both components of the Soviet Union in 1954, and Ukraine retained it when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, though Russia still maintains important military bases there, including the home port of the Black Sea Fleet.\n\n Oleksandr V. Turchynov, the speaker of Parliament and acting president of Ukraine, urged Russian military forces early on Thursday not to stray out of the designated Russian military zones.\n\n “I am addressing the Russian Black Sea Fleet command with a demand: all military servicemen should stay within the boundaries of of the territories stipulated by agreement,” Mr. Turchynov said as he presided over the Parliament. “Any movement of military servicemen with weapons outside this territory will be viewed as military aggression.”\n\n In his statement, Mr. Yanukovych warned that the largely Russian regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, including Crimea, would “not accept the anarchy and outright lawlessness” that has gripped the country. “I continue to consider myself the lawful head of the Ukrainian government, elected on the basis of the free expression of the will of Ukrainian citizens,” he said in the statement, according to news agencies, RIA Novosti and Itar-Tass. “I cannot be indifferent to the tragic events in my homeland.”\n\n Whether he can cling to any part of his former power remains far from clear. Members of his own party have deserted him, and the Ukrainian Parliament impeached him and moved on Thursday to approve an interim government, with elections for a new president planned for May. Ukraine’s political split reflects a deeper cultural divide in the country. In the 2010 presidential election, the opposition won in all of Ukraine’s western provinces, where most people speak Ukrainian rather than Russian and many call for deeper economic and political ties with Europe. \n\n Mr. Yanukovych’s remarks were his first since Saturday, when he appeared in a video that apparently was recorded in his political base in eastern Ukraine. Even in his diminished and humiliated position, with journalists and ordinary people traipsing through his presidential palace and sorting through incriminating records, Mr. Yanukovych asserted his authority over the country’s armed forces and warned that they should not be called in to quell the apparent rebellion in Simferopol.\n\n “I, as the actual president, have not allowed the armed forces of Ukraine to interfere in the ongoing internal political events,” he said, contradicting reports that he had ordered the military to intervene in Kiev, only to have his order rebuffed. “I continue to order this. In the case that anyone begins to give a similar order to the armed forces and power structures, those orders will be unlawful and criminal.”\n\n Russia has denounced the political upheaval in Kiev and refused to recognize the new interim government, but officials have also insisted that Russia would not intervene, even as it began a major military drill on Ukraine’s doorstep. Granting sanctuary to Mr. Yanukovych even as he claims to lead Ukraine would nonetheless deepen the confrontation with Europe and the United States.\n\n Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine’s leaders were bound by an agreement mediated by three European foreign ministers. That agreement, signed last Friday, called for an interim national unity government and new elections, but not until December. Mr. Yanukovych’s statement echoed that position, though it appears highly unlikely that the collapse of that agreement could now be reversed.\n\n The overnight raids in Simferopol created an ominous uncertainty here and left residents stunned. The raids took place just hours after thousands of Crimean Tatars, the region’s minority indigenous Turkic population, and a separate throng of ethnic Russians staged competing rallies outside Crimea’s regional Parliament. The rallies, which ended in a melee and left several people injured, disrupted a session of the regional Parliament that hard-line pro-Russia groups had hoped would declare Crimea’s secession from Ukraine.\n\n “This is the first step toward civil war,” said Igor Baklanov, a computer expert who joined a group of anxious residents gathered in a cold drizzle at a police line near the seized regional legislature. Rumors swirled of Russian troops on the way from Sevastopol, the headquarters of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, of Russian nationalists arriving in force to reinforce the blockaded government buildings and of negotiations between the local authorities and the unidentified gunmen.\n\n “Nobody knows who, what or why,” said a resident who identified himself only as Gennady and who voiced alarm that the armed action could set off a spiral of violence in a region riven by political, ethnic and religious differences.\n\n \n\n Crimeans supporting Russia marched into a square in front of the barricaded regional parliament building, waving flags and chanting, “Rossiya, Rossiya.”\n\n With most streets in Simferopol empty of traffic after authorities ordered a citywide holiday, columns of pro-Russia activists marched into a square in front of the barricaded Parliament building. Waving Russian flags and chanting “Rossiya, Rossiya,” they swelled an angry but peaceful throng that wants Crimea to split from Ukraine and join Russia.\n\n The regional Parliament called an emergency session for Friday afternoon, though it was unclear if one could be held in an occupied and now fortified building.\n\n Refat Chubalov, a member of the assembly and leader of Crimea’s ethnic Tatar minority, said he had not been informed about the session and warned that any vote to separate Crimea from Ukraine would be “very dangerous.” Asserting that Russian armored vehicles were waiting outside the city, he called for calm but also urged Tatar residents to form “self-defense” units to protect their interests.\n\n He blamed pro-Russian forces for the overnight seizure of government buildings, describing the action as “a direct interference in the affairs of Crimea and of Ukraine.”\n\n The developments came as the authorities in Kiev and Moscow traded bellicose warnings. Mr. Lavrov was quoted as saying that his country would defend its compatriots in Ukraine “uncompromisingly,” while officials in Kiev warned the Russian military to remain within its base in Sevastopol.\n\n Around noon, Pyotr Mekhed, the choice of the interim government for minister of defense, walked out of Parliament and huddled with a group of his supporters among Ukrainian veterans of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. The veterans earlier in the morning had driven an armored car onto the plaza in front of Parliament, saying they wanted to show “moral support for our candidate,” Mr. Mekhed.\n\n Oleg Mikhnyuk, a commander of a unit of Afghan veterans called the Afghan Hundred who protested on Maidan Square, said that in the discussion the veterans had weighed the significance of the armed takeover of the regional Parliament in Crimea a few hours earlier. They concluded that the armed and masked men taking action in the south were probably Russian commandos and that war with Russia on the peninsula loomed for any new minister of defense.\n\n “This is already a declaration of war,” Mr. Mikhnyuk said of events in Crimea. DEPUTY SECRETARY BURNS: Good morning. I am delighted to be back in Kyiv at this historic moment. President Obama and Secretary Kerry asked me to convey a simple message—a message of deep admiration for the courage and determination of Ukrainians in the face of last week’s tragic violence, and a message of strong American support for a stable, democratic, inclusive, and prosperous Ukraine.\n\n I was profoundly moved by my conversations last evening at St. Michael’s Cathedral with the medics, religious leaders, civil society activists and protesters who demonstrated for the whole world such bravery and selflessness on the Maidan. Let me repeat my sincerest condolences to the family members and loved ones of all who were injured or lost their lives in pursuit of a more just and democratic Ukraine. Their sacrifices inspire us all, and their selflessness should be a source of strength as Ukrainians seek to heal their society’s wounds, renew their democracy, and revive their economy.\n\n I have had extensive meetings over the past two days with a wide range of Ukrainian leaders, including Speaker Turchynov, Mr. Yatsenuk, Mr. Klychko, Mr. Tyahanybok, Mr. Poroshenko, Mr. Tihipko, and former Prime Minister Tymoshenko. I also met with Lady Ashton, the EU High Representative, and UN Special Envoy Robert Serry, with whom we share a strong interest in supporting Ukraine on its democratic path.\n\n In all my meetings, I emphasized the urgent importance of the Rada’s efforts to form a multi-party, technical government that represents all regions of Ukraine. Once that government is formed, we and our international partners can begin to take immediate steps to help support Ukraine economically and implement the reforms necessary to restore Ukraine’s political and economic health. A team of economic specialists from the Department of Treasury and White House accompanied me to Kyiv, and will stay on after my departure today to continue our consultations.\n\n We also look forward to working with the new government and civil society to support free and fair Presidential elections in May. We will continue to firmly support Ukraine’s unity and territorial integrity, and healthy relations with all of its neighbors, including Russia.\n\n Again, I am glad to be in Ukraine as it enters a crucial period in its history, a period of considerable challenges, but also great promise. The United States stands with the Ukrainian people at this remarkable moment, and we will do all we can to help them build the strong, sovereign and democratic country they so richly deserve.\n\n QUESTION: So you are talking about the immediate steps for the government in Ukraine. What exactly are you talking about? Is this just the matter of time for the expats to know the situation here? Or is it that you have something planned in mind, to help, to support? Is it just not involving in the political situation? Just economics or is it politics as well?\n\n DEPUTY SECRETARY BURNS: We will provide strong support not only for the revival of the Ukrainian economy, but also support for the political process, which has to begin with the formation of a new multi-party technocratic government. That will help prepare the way for free and fair elections in May, which as you know better than I do, will be very important for the future of this country. We also have an interest in working with our international partners to support the efforts of the new government to try and improve the security situation in this country as well.\n\n On the economic side, the reality is that the new government that will be formed will inherit an economic mess. It’s a reality that Ukraine has always had a great deal of economic potential, but it’s also a reality that its business climate has never matched that potential. That can change. It is possible to realize that potential. It is possible to fight corruption and all the other impediments to realizing that potential. We recognize that that effort will require and deserves support from the friends of Ukraine like the United States, like the European Union, like the IMF. And we’re working quite practically and quite intensively to be ready to provide that support.\n\n The first step, again, is the formation of a new government and an opportunity to sit down with that new government and identify the plans of the new Ukrainian government, their diagnosis of the problem, and then identify specifically what we can do to help. And we’ll be ready to do that along with the EU and the IMF because we recognize the urgency of the situation, we recognize what’s at stake for Ukraine and for the Ukrainian people.\n\n QUESTION: I’d like to hear more about the groups that are staying behind. What exactly are they doing? Their tasking, their mission and how far you have moved in what you described as an intensive study of Ukraine’s problems. I would like to hear more detail about that.\n\n DEPUTY SECRETARY BURNS: Sure. I have one colleague from the Treasury Department and one colleague from the White House staff who have accompanied me here to Kyiv. They have met with the Central Bank Governor, the acting Finance Minister, a range of other bankers and economic specialists here. They are also meeting with colleagues from the EU and IMF to try to coordinate in anticipation of the formation of a new government, so that we can be ready to move ahead once that new government has begun to lay out its plans and its needs. We don’t want to waste any time in trying to be prepared. We recognize the magnitude of the challenge and there are a lot of resources the international community can bring to bear in support of the IMF.\n\n QUESTION: As you know Russia has not yet recognized the current government and what do you think the West should to do to convince Russia to recognize us and even to give us some help, some aid to clear this mess? And what do you think about Mr. Brzezinski’s proposition/suggestion that there should be some kind of federalization of Ukraine?\n\n DEPUTY SECRETARY BURNS: I’ll just say a couple of things. First, let me reinforce the American position that we strongly support the choices that Ukrainians make to renew their democracy and revive their economy. We strongly support Ukraine’s territorial integrity and its unity. That is deeply in the interest not just of Ukrainians, but in our view, of the entire international community, including Russia. And so we hope over time to build on a common interest in a stable, prosperous Ukraine. I recognize all the challenges that lie ahead. But I do have considerable faith in the capacity of Ukrainians to make the right choices. And certainly, as they do they can count on the strong and continued support of the United States.\n\n QUESTION: There is evidence in the Ukrainian media and from observers of Russian military equipment in Crimea what do you think about those reports and evidence And how far is the United States prepared to go to prevent any military intervention or any military “game” in this context?\n\n DEPUTY SECRETARY BURNS: All that I would stress is what I said before, and that is that the United States strongly supports the unity and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Separatism of the sort that you’ve seen some speculation about in recent days is not in Ukraine’s interest and it’s not in anybody’s interest; and the United States will continue to reinforce that very firm position.\n\n QUESTION: In what way, do you think Ukraine establishes this good, healthy relationship with Russia? You know it is quite hard for us to have relations with Russia on an every-day basis. What other dangerous situations do you see for Ukraine?\n\n DEPUTY SECRETARY BURNS: On the first part of your question, I don’t underestimate the challenges ahead. But objectively, it seems to me to be very much in the interests of both Ukraine and Russia to have a healthy economic relationship, and also over time to build a stable and healthy political relationship. That’s never easy. On the broader question on what kinds of challenges Ukraine faces right now, you all know them far better than I do, you live them. There are obviously economic challenges. And there are bigger political and social challenges. There’s going to be a challenge to good leadership in Ukraine, to be able to reach out to people across this country, whether East or West, North and South, and help heal the wounds of recent weeks and months. That’s also never easy, especially after the emotion and the loss that people have suffered. But that’s what I meant by drawing inspiration from the selflessness of the people on the Maidan, to try to put the interests of the country above personal rivalries or political ambitions.\n\n QUESTION: My first question, did you discuss with any of the Ukrainian high-ranking officials who you met, the issue of the possible NATO membership perspective for Ukraine in the future. Was this issue raised in the discussions and talks that you had? And my second question, you mentioned that now the United States and the EU are standing hand in hand in unity with respect to Ukraine. Don’t you think that now it’s a time to do everything possible to promote the idea of EU membership for Ukraine, because like now it’s a bigger opportunity to do that, and we don’t have much time? What do you think about it?\n\n DEPUTY SECRETARY BURNS: We did not discuss the first issue, at least in the meetings that I’ve had over the last day and a half. And on the second issue, we’ve been strongly in favor of the choices that Ukrainians have made in the past and will continue to make in the future, the interests that Ukrainians have in a European future. The pace of that and the mechanics of that are obviously up to Ukrainians and to the European Union. But the United States certainly continues to be strongly supportive of that choice.\n\n INFORMATION OFFICER: That’s all the time we have.\n\n QUESTION: Do you know where our President is?\n\n DEPUTY SECRETARY BURNS: I don’t, I don’t have any more light to shed on that this morning.\n\n QUESTION: Did this (inaudible) ever come up in the conversations with the leaders?\n\n DEPUTY SECRETARY BURNS: A general conversation about it, but I as I said I don’t have any more light to shed on it this morning. State Department\n\n http://ukraine.usembassy.gov/statements/kerry-msnbc.html\n\n U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE\n\n Office of the Spokesperson \n\n February 26, 2014 \n\n Interview \n\n Treaty Room\n\n Washington, D.C. QUESTION: And good day. I’m Andrea Mitchell live from the State Department here in Washington. Secretary of State John Kerry joins me now here in the Treaty Room.\n\n Mr. Secretary, thank you very much.\n\n SECRETARY KERRY: Glad to be with you. Thank you. QUESTION: Thanks for being with us. Obviously, a lot of crises to cover, but first of mine is Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has issued an order for a drill mobilizing troops in the west of Russia. How worried should we be about any kind of military action from Russia into Ukraine? SECRETARY KERRY: Well, Andrea, first of all, let me just say that what has happened in Ukraine is quite remarkable. It’s a demonstration of the rapidity with which the people’s will will be heard or felt in today’s society. And I think the rapidity with which it has moved should frankly be a message to Russia, and Mr. Putin should listen carefully to Ukrainians who have voiced their desire for change. That’s number one.\n\n Number two, President Putin, in a telephone conversation with President Obama just the other day, committed to respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. And I think that’s incredibly important. It would be very difficult for me to understand how Russia would reconcile its position on Libya, its position on Syria, its warnings against intervention in another country and then not respect the sovereignty of Ukraine and the will of the people there.So we’re hoping that Russia will not see this as sort of a continuation of the Cold War. We don’t see it that way. We do not believe this should be an East-West, Russia-United States – this is not Rocky IV, believe me. We don’t see it that way. We see this as an opportunity for Russia, the United States, and others to strengthen Ukraine, help them in this transition, and there’s no reason that they can’t look east and west and be involved as a vital cog in the economy of all of us going forward. And that’s what our hope is – that there’s a transition government, that there are reforms put in place, that the IMF becomes involved, and that the Ukrainian people have an opportunity to decide their future after they’ve formed a new government.\n\n QUESTION: The Russian Foreign Ministry only today said that the opposition and the rebellion in Ukraine are extremists. They are really dialing up the rhetoric in the last 24 hours. SECRETARY KERRY: Well, there’s been some hard statements. I think that – I think to some degree, Russia has not been in touch with some of what’s been happening on the ground here. I think there were some encouragements by some people for Yanukovych – President Yanukovych to take – former President Yanukovych to take a very harsh position here. And I think the people made their wishes and their aspirations as clear as you can make it – 75-plus people killed in the streets, a remarkable day or several days of extraordinary violence, which their courage is now being rewarded.\n\n And I think Russia needs to be very careful in the judgments that it makes going forward here. We are not looking for confrontation, but we are making it clear that every country should respect the territorial integrity here, the sovereignty of Ukraine. Russia has said it will do that, and we think it’s important that Russia keeps its word.\n\n QUESTION: Do we know where Yanukovych is? SECRETARY KERRY: Well, I’m not going to speculate on the whereabouts of Yanukovych. QUESTION: Well, should he be prosecuted for war crimes? SECRETARY KERRY: I’m not going to speculate on any of the accountability components. Generically, we believe that anybody who made a decision or anybody who created these several days of government violence against their own people ought to be held accountable. But the first thing that has to happen is to establish a new government. The people have spoken through their elected representatives. This is active politics at the grassroots that has sprung up in the Rada, their legislature. They have voted according to their process, incidentally. They followed their procedures. They had the requisite number of votes. People who previously supported Yanukovych changed their positions, pulled their support away from him, and voted to impeach him.\n\n So, I mean, this has been a democratic process that has been felt in profound ways, and now I think it’s important for everybody to respect it and let the people of Ukraine find their government, create a reform process, have elections, and begin to get their economy moving. And that’s perhaps the most important thing here. Russia does not need or want a Ukraine that is unstable and more violent going forward and economically a basket case. It’s in everybody’s interest to try to help put this back together and have a democratic, pluralistic Ukraine.\n\n QUESTION: And – but Putin seems to think that we are meddling. Is the United States meddling? You know that there are those overheard conversations in the – SECRETARY KERRY: Well, you know that – no, the United States has been engaged with a country and with its people in the way that we are around the world engaged like any country. I mean, it’s no different. I mean, Russia is engaged with Assad in Syria. Russia is engaged in various places around the world through its diplomacy, trying to meet its interests. And we are engaged and have been engaged with Ukraine for a long period of time, as they have expressed their will to try to sign up for the Association Agreement with Europe and the Eastern Partnership. That’s what they wanted to do. Russia then came in and engaged with a $15 billion program and different things. I mean, I don’t think we need a sort of back-and-forth about who is pushing what set of opportunities for the people of Ukraine. \n\n The key here is to give the people of Ukraine the full space within which to make their decisions about where they want to go. That’s what we’re trying to do. We’re not putting pressure on them. We’re not urging something that they haven’t themselves expressed as a desire. We are trying to honor their intentions of putting together a democratic, pluralistic government that breaks away from this kleptocracy that existed there. And now we’re beginning to get some insights on the lifestyle of Mr. Yanukovych with his multimillion-dollar dining room and his yachts and the rest of it, and this is what the people were rebelling against.\n\n So I don’t think there’s any defense of what was there. What we need now to do is not get into an old Cold War confrontation. We need to work together in what does not have to be a zero-sum game to provide the capacity of the people of Ukraine to choose their future. That’s all that’s at stake. 25 February 2014 | Issue 5317\n\n By Anders Åslund\n\n \n\n Last week, the Ukrainian opposition suddenly gained a parliamentary majority through democratic and legal means as lawmakers defected in droves from President Viktor Yanukovych after his killing of 82 people in Kiev in three days. On Feb. 22, the president was impeached with the required two-thirds majority. It is still early to say how this transition to democracy will work, but it looks promising. What will this mean to Russia?\n\n The Ukrainian protests present a challenge to all Russians. Putin must realize the Eurasian Union is stillborn and Russia needs the EU. \n\n For the last three decades, I have been deeply involved in both Russia and Ukraine. To a foreigner, common Russian attitudes toward Ukraine are clearly contradictory. Russians will tell you that Ukrainians are their brother nation, but at the same time they claim that Ukraine is not a real nation, Ukrainian not an actual language, and Ukrainians are intellectually backward. Russians can barely hide their superiority complex toward Ukraine. Ukrainians take note and object in their quiet, polite fashion.\n\n In late 2004, the Orange Revolution turned the tables on the Russians. Suddenly, Ukraine was ahead in terms of democracy, freedom and modernity, although not in economic policy or wealth. President Vladimir Putin swiftly adopted a series of laws to curtail civil society and safeguard his authoritarian rule. Since the Orange government turned out to be disorganized, Putin could relax.\n\n In February 2010, Yanukovych won a free but not very fair presidential election with 49 percent of the vote in a runoff. At the time, the common view was that Yanukovych would turn into a Putin by installing a political vertical of power and greatly enriching his loyalists.\n\n Yanukovych's problem was that he had not learned Putin's sophisticated art of sharing. Instead, he concentrated all wealth in a tiny family circle, alienating everybody else. His political base did not expand but narrowed. As his political legitimacy dwindled, he imposed more repression. Russians have accepted some repression because their standard of living has risen palpably, but Yanukovych's predatory economic policies caused economic output to stagnate.\n\n In the end, Ukrainians asked themselves, \"Why should we accept a leader who robs and represses our country and only cares about himself?\"\n\n But dissatisfaction alone is rarely sufficient. It requires a catalyst to be unleashed. Foolishly, Yanukovych provided such a catalyst with the European Union agreement that he first endorsed and then rejected. Few were concerned about the free-trade agreement, but it represented a choice of civilization. Would Ukraine go for European values — freedom and justice, democracy and the rule of law — or for corruption and authoritarianism? To Ukrainians, the choice was clearcut, and they stood up in protest.\n\n The Ukrainian public protests present a challenge to all Russians. This might explain the uncommonly crude Russian television propaganda about Ukraine. A month ago, I participated in a political panel of 10 people at the Gaidar Forum in Moscow. I was the sole panelist who wasn't a Russian political analyst. The general view was that political stability and economic stagnation would prevail in Russia this year. If anything were to shake the country, six of us suggested it would be Ukraine's Euromaidan.\n\n Euromaidan challenges Russians' perception of themselves. Russians identify themselves as brave for good reason, but now they look cowardly next to Ukrainians. For less good reason, opinion polls show that Russians consider themselves as people of traditional values. Yet now they look like cynical cowards, while Ukrainians have defended their nation and universal values such as freedom, democracy and justice. \n\n After many years of cynicism, the Ukrainian public has decided to clear out more than 40 Lenin monuments, which represent inhumane ideals. This is Ukraine's moment of de-communization, a period that lasted all too briefly in Russia in August 1991. In Moscow, Lenin still rests in his mausoleum on Red Square.\n\n The most evident blow to the Kremlin is that the victory of Euromaidan means that the Eurasian Union will not take place. The union is protectionist and economically damaging to all its members. If Putin wants to enter the modern world, he had better abandon it and opt for European integration like Ukraine. The Eurasian Union could fail through falling growth rates in Russia combined with excessive subsidies to Belarus. The ultimate insult to Putin would be if a dissatisfied President Nursultan Nazarbayev declares that Kazakhstan will leave the association.\n\n The Yanukovych model of \"presidential robber capitalism\" was much more crude and single-minded than the elaborate Putin model of state and crony capitalism. But both men share the view that presidents are entitled to top-level corruption and authoritarianism. While Yanukovych is now being chased like a criminal on the run, Putin must feel somewhat less comfortable. He expressed such discomfort after his friend Moammar Gadhafi of Libya was chased and killed.\n\n Meanwhile, Russia's economic growth has dwindled since 2009 and now seems to have stopped because of Putin's policy of state and crony capitalism. Putin's reserves are running low. Therefore, Euromaidan puts the Putin regime in a new light to thinking Russians: \"If Ukrainians can rise against authoritarianism and corruption and opt for European values and integration, why shouldn't we be able to do so, too?\"\n\n The Kremlin faces a stark choice. One possibility is that it will choose the same policies as after the Orange Revolution: hostility to Ukraine, including cuts in gas deliveries and trade sanctions, and increased repression at home. But those policies were possible when the Russian standard of living rose more than ever. Putin also was lucky that Ukraine's Orange government collapsed on its own.\n\n Now the economic backdrop is much worse. The Russian standard of living is barely rising. Russia's client Yanukovych has been exposed as a greedy thief and executioner, abandoned by his own party. The Ukrainian revolutionaries and all the more the Ukrainian people have likely learned their lesson from the failure of the Orange Revolution.\n\n Presumably, the Kremlin realizes that Euromaidan proves its old policy is no longer viable. As democracy has broken through in Ukraine, the crudest Russian propaganda about Euromaidan appears to have abated. But is Putin able to realize that his Eurasian Union is stillborn and that Russia's best hope is European values and European integration?\n\n Euromaidan might wake Russians up. But I wouldn't bet on it. William Courtney \n\n | \n\n February 27, 2014\n\n \n\n Events in Ukraine evoke memories of the Soviet collapse in 1991. Then a hidebound system slid into bankruptcy, lost popular respect, and plunged into the ash heap of history. Now two decades of stasis in Ukraine might suffer a similar fate, but only if the next government reverses course and embraces bold reform. Then as now, the right Western policy is to support reform and realistic aspirations, and not back specific leaders or excuse poor performance.\n\n Lethargy gripped Ukraine for over a decade under its first two presidents, Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma. The country's first popular uprising, the 2004 Orange revolution, brought hopes for change. Incompetent and self-aggrandizing leaders—including president Viktor Yushchenko and prime ministers Yulia Tymoshenko and Viktor Yanukovych—turned hopes into dismay. None pursued the reforms Ukraine needed to lift its economy out of poverty and pay for Russian gas. Unlike Georgia after its 2003 Rose revolution, Orange leaders did not clean out or diminish bloated Soviet-style bureaucracy. Ukraine remained vulnerable to constant Russian pressures.\n\n Ukraine's second successful popular uprising offers cause for optimism. The country has experienced several democratic and largely peaceful changes in power, notwithstanding Yanukovych's recent brutality. Civil society has become more robust, a vibrant Ukrainian diaspora in the West extends encouragement, and Ukraine has come to be seen in Europe as European. To secure wider freedoms and better governance, vast numbers of courageous Ukrainians have twice gone into the streets to oppose semi-authoritarian rule.\n\n The West has been properly supportive. On January 31, German chancellor Angela Merkel said the opposition's efforts were \"justified\" and there was \"a great need for change in Ukraine.\" On February 19, President Obama cautioned that Yanukovych's government would be held \"primarily responsible\" for the treatment of peaceful protesters and he warned of consequences for those who \"step over the line.\"\n\n Europe marshaled its outrage at Yanukovych's predation more slowly than America, but as violence mounted it swing into action. Going beyond US action, the European Union enacted asset freezes and visa bans on Ukrainian evil-doers.\n\n Chancellor Merkel exercised leadership of the kind the German president called for at the Munich security conference last month. The EU dispatched three influential foreign ministers, from France, Germany and Poland, to Kyiv to mediate a solution. Their message shook Yanukovych. As with the 2011 Libyan intervention, America led successfully from within a coalition of allies.\n\n The West is helping Ukraine by engaging Russia's Kremlin while also cautioning it. On February 21 Obama telephoned president Vladimir Putin to seek cooperation on a peaceful transition in Ukraine. In a February 23 phone call with the Russian leader, Merkel obtained a pledge of support for Ukraine's \"territorial integrity,\" implying that Russia would not attempt to split off Crimea or the eastern part of Ukraine. The same day national security adviser Susan Rice warned that Russian military intervention would be a \"grave mistake.\"\n\n Thus far, however, it is unclear whether Russia is doubling down on a bad bet. The uprising in Ukraine came after months of punitive Russian trade embargoes and other intimidation aimed at scaring Ukraine from moving closer to the European Union and at keeping Yanukovych in power. This failed strategy united many otherwise fractious Ukrainians, and led Russia to suffer its worst foreign policy defeat since independence in 1991. On February 24 prime minister Dmitry Medvedev falsely characterized the change in Ukraine as the result of an \"armed mutiny.\" Such heated rhetoric suggests Moscow may be readying its people for more direct intervention in Ukraine.\n\n The turn in Kyiv has dealt a blow to the Russian-dominated Eurasian customs union, and to Putin's plans for a broader union beyond. Some members which chafe at the custom union's protectionism, such as Kazakhstan, may become more restive.\n\n Russia is unlikely to separate eastern Ukraine. Since 1991 it has shown no interest in attaching itself to Russia, which would swallow control of the region and its industry, marginalizing some local elites. Talented young people in eastern Ukraine see themselves as future Europeans, not future Russians. One sign of Russia's limited influence in the east of Ukraine is the humiliation that befell Yanukovych after he abandoned Kyiv for his home region, Donetsk. Border authorities there refused to allow his aircraft to depart for Russia. Yanukovych apparently then fled to safer ground in Crimea, where Russia has greater sway.\n\n The Kremlin's ambitions for Crimea remain uncertain but are worrying. Ethnic Russians comprise three-fifths of the population, and some are forming militias. The speaker of Crimea's parliament has spoken of possible secession. A senior Russian parliamentarian is in Crimea claiming that his country will protect the interests of Russians there.\n\n The Kremlin may view Crimea as an analogue to Abkhazia, a Russian-occupied separatist region of Georgia. Crimea, which hosts Russia's Black Sea fleet, is of higher strategic importance for Moscow. The 2008 invasion of Abkhazia and South Ossetia provoked the greatest crisis in Russia's relations with the West since 1991. In 2009, when Russian war propaganda was spinning up again, the West made clear to the Kremlin that further aggression in Georgia would lead to a stronger Western reaction. Russia backed off.\n\n The West should clarify that Russia would face sanctions if it were to use force in Crimea. To underline its resolve, America should alter warship deployments in the Black Sea by rotating them to the western Black Sea. In response to the announcement on February 26 that Russian forces on Ukraine's eastern border are being put at the \"highest degree of combat readiness\" for an exercise, the West should voice immediate concern in the United Nations Security Council and share intelligence with Ukraine on the Russian maneuvers.\n\n From an economic perspective, Ukraine has been living on borrowed time. The government is almost bankrupt. Ukraine has the most energy-inefficient economy in the world. Yanukovych obtained the promise of a $15 billion loan from Moscow, but without economic reforms Ukraine may not have been able to repay its borrowing.\n\n As new and more inclusive leaders and governance structures take shape in Ukraine, economic reform ought to receive top priority. An urgent need is to end subsidies to domestic energy prices and to maintain an over-valued exchange rate.\n\n In 1992 Russian president Boris Yeltsin undertook shock therapy reforms which ever since have aided the economy. The West hedged in criticizing their corrupt implementation, however, and many Russians blamed the West for their impoverishment. In pressing Ukraine's leaders to liberalize the economy in return for international aid, the West and the IMF ought to hold them accountable for transparent reforms, and urge that leaders build wide stakeholder support for changes that will pain some Ukrainians even as they boost overall productivity and exports. The West can also help Ukraine by returning, and persuading others (e.g., certain Persian Gulf states) to return, plunder that Yanukovych and his cohorts stashed abroad.\n\n Some observers call for a Western and IMF counter to Putin's $15 billion \"bailout,\" but political support for such levels of aid may be wanting. Ukrainian reforms will have to make the biggest contribution to restoring the government to sound financial footing. The West should not raise undue expectations.\n\n Likewise, although Ukraine will accelerate its path westward, hopes must be tempered. Ukraine's per capita GDP, measured by purchasing power parity, is about half that of the EU's poorest members, Bulgaria and Romania. Many in the EU now have buyers' remorse for having taken in these two countries so soon. Only thorough-going economic reforms over a decade or more could get Ukraine fit to join the EU.\n\n Reminiscent of George Kennan in opposing NATO expansion eastward, former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski argues in the Financial Times that Ukraine \"must have no participation in any anti-Moscow alliance.\" Ukrainians would view as betrayal any policy that denied them an opportunity to join NATO. Ukrainian Americans and their compatriots the influential Central and East European coalition would excoriate any US leaders who backed such a policy. So would Senator John McCain. Russians would infer that the West was signaling that Ukraine was fair game for intimidation.\n\n Ukraine has a way to go to become a stable and prosperous democracy. As Europe moves to secure more of its eastern flank, the West should be ready for intensive engagement with and support for Ukraine, but also tough love on reform.\n\n William Courtney was US ambassador to Kazakhstan and Georgia, and special assistant to the President for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia.\n\n ____________________________________________________________________ Gordonua.com\n\n The following was published in the blog of Ukraine's stellar journalist and premier interviewer Dmytri Gordon\n\n Crimean legislator: Russia's intervention in Ukraine will be “the Empire's last fart” \n\n Russia got entangled in the Chechen war and still cannot get out, but there are only 700,000 Chechens, whereas Ukraine is a 46-million country, says Leonid Pilunsky, a member of the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea. \n\n \"If Russia tries to set its foot somewhere in Ukraine, it can only be in the Crimea. Where else can poor Russians get bombed by ‘vicious Banderovites’? Everything is turned upside down! Russia’s interference in Ukraine may become her last imperial fart. This will be Russia’s last diarrhea -- because they got entangled in the war in Chechnya and still cannot get out of it. Shooting never stops there. But there are only 700 thousand Chechens. And Ukrainians are 46 million, of which 35 million have a genetic memory about as Russia-inflicted famines and wars that were destroying the Ukrainian nation. And now they will attempt to get into the Crimea ?\" Pilunsky wondered . \n\n \"If Russia thinks that the Georgian scenario may work in the Crimea, they need to remember: the population of Kyiv alone is equal to that of the whole Georgia. A country like Ukraine cannot be gulped in like that. And if they are going to cry out that Russian blood may be shed, then I can tell them that Russian blood was shed already: out of nearly 100 killed on Maidan, there were 20 Russians, who stood on the barricades against this moron Yanukovych – whom those idiots are now defending. Nevertheless, they still say it was the blood of Banderovites,\" said Pilunsky . \n\n The Crimean legislator also emphasized that if Russia chose to invade the Crimea, This would start an endless war that would be worse than in Yugoslavia. \n\n “If Russia moves in her troops, this lead to a bloodbath, all priests of the Moscow patriarchate may get killed, with bomb blasts to follow. That war would go to infinity. In comparison, Yugoslavia will look like a children’s amusement park,” believes Pilunsky. \n\n \" The Russians can certainly do what the Germans did – when they dressed in Polish uniforms, crossed the border and shot the garrison in Gleiwitz. But it should be remembered that it triggered World War II. Or perhaps they will act like Konrad Henlein who appealed to Hitler in order to annex the Sudetenland alleging that Czechs were killing the poor Germans… However, six years later Henlein was hanged ter six years Geynleyna hanged…” remarked Pilunsky. Window on Eurasia: Is Putin at Risk of Becoming a Kerensky? Staunton, February 26 – The Russian media is reporting today that across the country various political organizations like Rodina, the Eurasian Union of Youth, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky’s Liberal Democratic Party are organizing “volunteers” to be dispatched to Ukraine to oppose the Maidan. In “Yezhednevny zhurnal,” Aleksandr Golts says that it isn’t clear whether this is “an initiative ‘from below’” in response to Russian commentaries on Ukraine or whether someone in the Kremlin has “recalled the Chinese experience [during the Korean War] and wants to cover its interference in Ukraine with so-called volunteers” (ej.ru/?a=note&id=24539). The Moscow commentator says that he “doesn’t know which of these variants is worse.” On the one hand, if it is a popular response to Kremlin propaganda, it may get out of hand because the Russian authorities won’t be abl",

            "text": "Fears of a major regional conflict in Crimea pitting Russia against the west have intensified after unknown pro-Russian gunmen seized the government and parliament building in a well co-ordinated military operation.\n\nAccording to witnesses, the men dressed in fatigues stormed Crimea's regional administrative complex in Simferopol at 5am on Thursday. They hoisted a Russian flag above the parliament building. About 120 men were holed up inside, armed with heavy weapons including rocket-propelled grenades and sniper rifles, witnesses said.\n\nThey threw a flash grenade in response to a journalist's questions. Calls to region's legislature rang unanswered, and its website was down.\n\nIt was unclear if the men were members of a pro-Russian self-defence militia formed in the aftermath of Ukraine's revolution or undercover Russian soldiers.\n\nSpeaking in Kiev, the former head of the Crimean parliament, Serhiy Kunitsyn, described the men as \"professionally trained\". He said he had been on the phone to Crimea \"all night\". The gunmen were heavily armed, he said, with enough weaponry to defend the complex \"for a month\".\n\nEither way, the seizure dramatically escalates tensions on the already volatile Crimean peninsula. Ukraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, who has been in the job since the removal of Viktor Yanukovych last week, explicitly warned Russia not to intervene in the crisis by moving troops. The Kremlin's Black Sea fleet is based near Simferopol in the port of Sevastopol.\n\nTurchynov said: \"I am appealing to the military leadership of the Russian Black Sea fleet. Any military movements, the more so if they are with weapons, beyond the boundaries of this territory [the base] will be seen by us as military aggression.\" Ukraine's foreign ministry also summoned Russia's acting envoy in Kiev for immediate consultations.\n\nEU leaders expressed alarm at the latest developments. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has ordered fighter jets to a state of high alert, as well as large-scale military exercises on Ukraine's border. In a tweet, the Nato secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, urged Russia not to do anything that would \"escalate tension or create misunderstanding\". Poland's foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, called the seizure of government buildings in the Crimea a \"very dangerous game\".\n\nHe told a news conference: \"This is a drastic step, and I'm warning those who did this and those who allowed them to do this, because this is how regional conflicts begin.\"\n\nHours after the parliament building was seized, Yanukovych revealed that he was now in Moscow and had \"sought protection\" from Putin. Yanukovych, who fled Kiev after government troops shot dead more than 80 people, excoriated Ukraine's new leadership unveiled on Wednesday and said he was still the country's legitimate president. He appeared to give approval to secessionist pro-Russian forces in Crimea who have rejected Kiev's authority, and said an \"orgy of extremism\" had swept the country. \"Now it is becoming clear that the people in south-eastern Ukraine and in Crimea do not accept the power vacuum and complete lawlessness in the country,\" he said.\n\nThe gunmen barricaded doors into the parliament building with wooden crates. Police sealed off the area on Wednesday, as a crowd supportive of the seizure gathered outside. Two people died and 35 were injured during clashes outside the building on Wednesday between pro-Russian demonstrators and Muslim Tartars. About half of Crimea's 2 million population are ethnic Russians. The Tartars – the peninsula's original Turkic-speaking Muslim inhabitants – are 300,000 strong and support the authorities in Kiev.\n\nEyewitnesses described the moment when the armed men turned up. \"We were building barricades in the night to protect parliament. Then this young Russian guy came up with a pistol … we all lay down, some more ran up, there was some shooting and around 50 went in through the window,\" Leonid Khazanov, an ethnic Russian, told Reuters.\n\nKhazanov added: \"They're still there … Then the police came, they seemed scared. I asked them [the armed men] what they wanted, and they said: 'To make our own decisions, not to have Kiev telling us what to do'.\"\n\nThe former head of the central executive body of Crimean Tatars, Mustafa Jemilev, said the situation was extremely worrying. He suggested the gunmen had arrived from Sevastopol, where the Russian fleet is based. \"The people in camouflage and without any distinctive signs came by buses from the Sevastopol side. There are reports of movement of armed vehicles of the Russian fleet in different directions. We also got signs that in many hotels there are Russian soldiers wearing civilian clothes. The Russian general consul office says they have nothing to do with these events. But they would hardly tell the truth.\"\n\nJemilev speculated that the gunmen could be Russian soldiers or members of Berkut, the now-disbanded riot police unit deployed against opposition protesters in Kiev. Lifenews.ru, a pro-Kremlin Russian website with links to Russia's spy agencies, however, said they were veterans from the army and police. According to US diplomatic cables leaked in 2010 by Wikileaks, Russia's military intelligence wing – the GRU – is highly active in Crimea.\n\nThe secretary to the head of parliament, Oksana Korniychuk, said on Wednesday a referendum would be held on the peninsula to determine its future status. This would almost certainly fuel demands among Crimea's ethnic Russian majority for a union with Russia.\n\nAbout 100 police had gathered in front of the parliament building on Thursday. A similar number of people carrying Russian flags later marched up to the building chanting \"Russia, Russia\" and holding a sign calling for a Crimean referendum.\n\nMany wore orange and black striped ribbons that symbolise support for Russia. One of them, Alexei, 30, said: \"We have our own constitution, Crimea is autonomous. The government in Kiev are fascists, and what they're doing is illegal … We need to show our support for the guys inside [parliament]. Power should be ours.\"\n\n\"Yesterday Russian people were attacked and murdered by Tatar extremists. We will not allow this fascism from Kiev to happen here,\" said 43 year-old construction worker, Spartak. \"Crimea wants independence and we want parliament to hold a referendum on this. We have been hijacked.\"\n\nPolicemen informed passersby that Karl Marx Street was closed due to the presence of snipers in the areas. Nearby shops and businesses have closed and pulled down their shutters.\n\n\"The actions in Kiev are a provocation to Crimea. People here didn't chose this fascist government. Here we will not have not have memorials to Bandera [a western Ukrainian hero viewed as a fascist by many of those in the east and south of Ukraine],\" said Valentina Fedorova, aged 60.\n\nIt is unclear how Ukraine's new government in Kiev will respond. The acting interior minister, Arsen Avakov, who said the attackers had automatic weapons and machine guns, urged calm. He said on Facebook: \"Provocateurs are on the march. It is the time for cool heads.\"\n\nTurchynov, speaking to the parliament in Kiev,, described the attackers as \"criminals in military fatigues with automatic weapons\".\n\nHe also called on Moscow not to violate the terms of an agreement that gives the Russian Black Sea fleet basing rights at Sevastopol until 2042.\n\nThe regional prime minister said he had spoken to the people inside the building by telephone but they had not made any demands or said why they were inside.

give up crimea without a fight anyone that thinks otherwise is just being delusional therussian black sea fleets main base at sevastopol is far too strategically important in addition ethnic russians make up approximately 60 percent of the population of crimea and most of the population is rabidly prorussian image vladimir putin wiki commons in fact many prominent crimean politicians are already calling for reunification with russia so if you have been thinking that russia is just going to fold up shop and go home now that proeuropean protesters have violently seized power in kiev you can quit holding your breath the truth is that russia is more than willing to fight a war over crimea and considering the fact that vitally important pipelines that pump natural gas from russia to the rest of europe go right through ukraine it is not likely that russia will just willingly hand the rest of ukraine over to the us and the eu either if the us and the eu push too hard in ukraine a major regional war may erupt which could ultimately lead to something much larger russia and ukraine have very deep historical ties most americans may not think that ukraine is very important but the russians consider ukraine to be of the utmost strategic importance as an american how would you feel if another nation funded and organized the violent overthrow of the democraticallyelected canadian government and replaced it with a government that was virulently antiamerican by doing this to ukraine the united states and the eu are essentially sticking a pin in russias eye needless to say russia is extremely angry at this point and they are gearing up for war the following are 12 signs that russia is ready to fight a war over crimea 1 more russian military vehicles continue to pour into crimea just check out this video 2 russian military vehicles have been photographed in the main square of sevastopol 3 russian military jets near the border with ukraine have been put on combat alert 4 russia has ordered surprise military exercises along the ukrainian border 5 in connection with those exercises it is being reported that russia has deployed 150000 troops along the border with ukraine 6 russia already has approximately 26000 troops stationed at their naval base in sevastopol 7 russian ships carrying additional soldiers have been spotted off the coast of crimea russias large landing ship nikolai filchenkov has arrived near the russia black sea fleets base at sevastopol which russia has leased from ukraine since the fall of the soviet union in 1991 the ship is reported to be carrying as many as 200 soldiers and has joined four additional ships carrying an unknown amount of special forces troops flotcom also reported over the weekend that personnel from the 45th airborne special forces unit and additional divisions had been airlifted into anapa a city on russias black sea coastline 8 russian defense minister sergei shoigu made the following statement to reporters on wednesday measures are taken to guarantee the security of our facilities 9 an unidentified russian official has told the financial times that russia is willing to use military force to protect crimea moscow earlier revealed that it would be ready to go for war over the crimea region in order to protect the large population and army installations if ukraine breaks apart it will trigger a war they will lose crimea first because we will go in and protect it just as we did in georgia an unidentified russian official told the financial times 10 officials in sevastopol have installed a russian citizen as mayor of the city 11 approximately 120 prorussian gunmen have seized the crimean parliament building and have raised the russian flag 12 there are rumors that russian authorities have offered protection to ousted ukrainian president viktor yanukovych viktor f yanukovych the ousted president of ukraine declared on thursday that he remained the lawful president of the country and appealed to russia to secure my personal safety from the actions of extremists russian news agencies reported that he had already arrived in russia but officials did not immediately confirm that no matter what the new government in kiev says and no matter how hard the us and the eu push russia will never give up crimea the following is what a recent debka article had to say about the matter there is no way that president vladimir putin will relinquish russian control of the crimean peninsula and its military bases there – or more particularly the big black sea naval base at sevastopol this military stronghold is the key to russias middle east policy if it is imperiled so too are russias military posture in syria and its strategic understandings with iran and you know what the people of crimea do not want russia to leave either in fact they overwhelmingly want russia to help defend them against the new government in kiev as you read this militia groups are being formed in crimea to fight back against the nationalist invasion that they are anticipating just check out the following excerpt from a recent time magazine article many of the people at the rally in sevastopol were not just ready to believe they were convinced of the imminent nationalist invasion what scared them most were the rightwing political parties and militant groups that have played a role in ukraines revolution what do you think theyre going to do with all those weapons they seized from police in kiev theyre going to come here and make war said sergei bochenko who identified himself as the commander of a local militia group in sevastopol called the southern russian cossack battalion in preparation he said his group of several hundred men had armed themselves with assault rifles and begun to train for battle theres not a chance in hell were going to accept the rule of that fascist scum running around in kiev with swastikas he said that may be overstating the case nowhere in ukraine has the uprising involved neonazi groups and no swastikas have appeared on the revolutions insignia but every one of the dozen or so people time spoke to in sevastopol was certain that the revolt was run by fascists most likely on the payroll of the us state department and just remember what happened back in 2008 in south ossetia and abkhazia the russians have already shown that they are not afraid to militarily intervene in order to protect russian citizens so what would the us and the eu do if a war erupts between russia and ukraine would they risk a direct military confrontation with russia in order to help ukraine i am very concerned about where all of this could be heading what about you what do you think please feel free to share your thoughts by posting a

Urging the European Union and the United States not to intervene in shaping the country’s future, Sergei Lavrov said: ‘It’s dangerous and counterproductive to try to force upon Ukraine a choice on the principle: “You are either with us or against us,”‘” reports Sky News in London\n\nExcerpts from today’s report in the New York Times:\n\nMr. Yanukovych’s remarks were his first since he appeared in a video on Saturday night after fleeing Ukraine’s capital, Kiev, for eastern Ukraine.\n\nHis defiance of the country’s new interim leaders only deepened the political turmoil in the country and threatened to draw Russia more deeply into the conflict.\n\nMr. Yanukovych, in a letter published by news agencies here, went on to suggest that largely Russian regions of Ukraine – including the east and Crimea – did not accept “the anarchy and outright lawlessness” that had gripped the country and said that orders by the new authorities to use the armed forces to impose order were unlawful.\n\nHe clearly meant the response to pro-Russia demonstrations in Crimea, which took an ugly turn on Thursday morning when armed gunmen seized control of the regional Parliament in Simferopol.\n\n“I, as the actual president, have not allowed the armed forces of Ukraine to interfere in the ongoing internal political events,” he said, contradicting early reports that he had ordered the military to intervene in Kiev, only to have his order rebuffed. “I continue to order this. In the case that anyone begins to give a similar order to the armed forces and power structures, those orders will be unlawful and criminal.”\n\nRumors that Mr. Yanukovych had arrived in Russia first surfaced on Wednesday night, with unnamed sources variously putting him at a hotel in Moscow — which denied it on Thursday — or in a government sanitarium outside the city.\n\nThe Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said in a brief telephone interview that he was not able to speak on the matter now.\n\nOn Wednesday night, he said he did not know if Mr. Yanukovych had arrived, but a senior member of the upper house of Parliament said he knew for a fact that it was not true….\n\nRussia has denounced the political upheaval in Kiev and refused to recognize the interim government.\n\nAt the same time, officials have expressed deep frustration with, and at times ridicule of, Mr. Yanukovych’s handling of the crisis.\n\nRussia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, has repeatedly said that Ukraine’s leaders were bound by an agreement mediated by three European foreign ministers.\n\nThat agreement, signed last Friday, called for an interim national unity government and new elections, but not until December.\n\nMr. Yanukovych fled Kiev the next day, as security forces that had clashed with protesters withdrew from Kiev’s center and even members of his own party began resigning or changing sides. The new Parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, has since impeached him, begun to form a new government and called elections to be held in May.",

through a combination of carrots and sticks events are fastmoving and volatile on friday russian special forces and helicopter gunships invaded crimea they closed the main airport and setup checkpoints seizing key buildings on saturday the russian duma authorized the deployment of armed forces to crimea which has a majority ethnic russian population by sunday 6000 russian forces established complete control of crimea russia may escalate the conflict by deploying forces in the ethnic russian belt between donetsk and khirkiv will putin take steps to liberate other ethnic russian territories in the socalled near abroad prowestern countries in baltic states georgia and moldova should beware russias invasion of crimea was no surprise moscow telegraphed its intentions the same way it did before invading georgia in 2008 when viktor yanukovych was overthrown russia launched military exercises on the russiaukraine border scrambled war planes and put tens of thousands of troops on alert dmitry medvedev warned that the turmoil in ukraine posed a real threat to our interests and to our citizens lives and health obama waited until after russias invasion to warn of costs secretary john kerry declared that russias actions were unacceptable us protests were too nondescript and too late the time to warn putin was before he deployed special forces putin is in complete control of the situation he delights in making a mockery of obamas righteous indignation exposing the hypocrisy and weakness of the west after obamas wobbly warning to syria putin knows that obama will never go to war over ukraine at this stage obama must avoid overheated rhetoric idle threats serve no purpose the united states should focus on keeping the conflict from escalating immediate measures are also needed to stabilize ukraine when kerry goes to kiev on tuesday he should offer specific types of economic security and political assistance even a token loan guarantee will demonstrate support for the interim government huge sums will be needed to pull ukraines economy from the brink the international monetary fund imf should intensify efforts to assemble a 20 billion rescue package details can be finalized after ukraines new government is elected meanwhile the imf should work with the interim government to finalize loan terms including structural adjustments austerity spending and reduced energy subsidies transparency and anticorruption measures will be needed ukraine also suffers a democracy deficit kerry can announce us support for consolidating ukraines democratic transition which focuses on civil society not just statebuilding support for judicial and electoral reform is also a priority assistance should not only target western ukraine ethnic russian regions in the east should also benefit the natoukraine commission languished during yanukovychs administration the north atlantic council nac should accelerate ukraines nato membership by revitalizing its membership action plan meanwhile nato can show solidarity by conducting joint military training exercises with ukrainian armed forces nato can also extend its combat air patrol to ukraine nato monitors could be sent to the russiaukraine border the us can strengthen bilateral security cooperation by dispatching the secretary of defense and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to kiev to review ukraines military capacity in the context of usukraine national defense talks transatlantic cooperation is critical the eu has given vague assurances brussels should be more specific about ways its european neighborhood policy can support ukraines economic and political stabilization it should affirm its commitment to an association agreement and establish visa liberalization for ukrainians traveling to eu member states the west must establish clear red lines with russia a us envoy should visit moscow to demand that russian forces return to their bases in crimea abiding by current lease terms for the naval air station in sevastapol emphasize that sending additional forces to crimea or other parts of ukraine would represent a serious escalation warn against deploying new weapons systems in crimea including surface to air missiles the envoy should also warn russia not to make the mistake of establishing diplomatic relations with crimea russia signed friendship cooperation and mutual assistance agreements with abkhazia and south ossetia on september 17 2008 the agreements violated ceasefire terms ending the russiageorgia war perpetuating hostilities the obama administration has suspended preparatory discussions for the g8s upcoming meeting in russia if russias expands its aggression can g8 members attend the sochi summit in june

bilateral trade talks the eu can do its part by suspending negotiations with russia on the partnership and cooperation agreement it could revoke the visa facilitation regime for russia the eu can also impose sanctions on russian businesses investing in crimea a carrots and sticks strategy must include positive incentives kiev should pledge not to use force against crimea it should avoid actions that russia might use to justify its aggression the nac should issue a statement that it will not take military action over crimea the ukrainian government should reiterate its commitment to the

identifying new ways to enhance local control over governance economic affairs natural resources and cultural rights under un auspices a peace implementation council pic could be established to build confidence between russia and ukraine including crimea the pic could include working groups on security and humanitarian issues as well as an incident prevention and response mechanism to prevent disputes along the administrative boundary lines from escalating a hot line connecting russia and ukrainian defense officials should be established the international community could broker a declaration on the nonuse of force between russia and ukraine with crimean representatives as signatories the declaration is not a treaty between sovereigns therefore it would not represent any recognition of crimea russia needs a facesaving way out of the current crisis it is unlikely that russia wants to annex crimea it has enough problems within its current borders besides 12 percent of crimeans are muslim tatars they could radicalized and join forces with muslims extremists in dagestan and chechnya rather than push for elections on may 25 a slower timetable could take some stress out of ukraines transition yanukovych opposition leaders and a russian envoy signed an eumediated accord on february 21 calling for presidential elections by the end of 2014 the obama administration also needs a way out it needs to defuse the conflict with russia and discourage putin from aggressing elsewhere americas prestige is at stake recent events in ukraine highlight americas downward trajectory from the unipolar moment of the early 1990s it may appear that the west has few options but it has many diplomatic tools at its disposal if russia is the problem it must also be part of the

ground and air forces on ukraines doorstep wednesday intending to demonstrate his countrys military preparedness at a time of heightened tensions with europe and the united states over the turmoil gripping russias western neighbor scuffles erupted outside in crimea as thousands of prorussia demonstrators confronted muslim crimean tatars backing the new ukrainian leadership the obama administration said any russian military intervention in ukraine would be a costly and grave mistake russias military put tens of thousands of troops in western russia on alert at 2 pm for an exercise scheduled to last until march 3 the minister of defense sergei k shoigu also announced unspecified measures to tighten security at the headquarters of russias black sea fleet on ukraines crimea peninsula the orders came as thousands of ethnic russians gathered outside the regional parliament in crimeas capital simferopol to protest the political upheaval in ukraines capital kiev that felled the government of president viktor f yanukovych over the weekend and turned him into a fugitive crimea was a part of russian territory until the soviet union ceded it to the soviet socialist republic of ukraine in 1954 and russians there have already pleaded for the kremlins intervention to protect the region and its population from ukraines new leadership crimea is russian some of the protesters screamed as brawls erupted with rival demonstrations by crimeas ethnic tatars supporting the new interim authorities while the military maneuvers were largely seen as saberrattling and not a precursor to armed intervention they elicited new warnings from western governments notably the united states which reminded russia of its own admonishments to the west about bigpower military adventurism speaking to a small group of reporters in washington secretary of state john kerry said it was important for the russians to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of ukraine and i dont think there should be any doubt whatsoever that any kind of military intervention that would violate the sovereign territorial integrity of ukraine would be a huge a grave mistake mr kerry did not specify what the united states was prepared to do in response to a russian military intervention focusing instead on what he said the russians would sacrifice i think it would cost them hugely in the world where they are trying to assert a sort of greater legitimacy with respect to their diplomacy he said that would blow it into shreds but mr kerry asserted that the united states did not see ukraine a eastwest battleground sayingthis is not rocky iv mr kerry also said the united states was considering a 1 billion package of loan guarantees to ukraine to help address the deepening economic crisis there as the interim leaders scrambled on wednesday to form a new government able to find ways out of an impending default they chose as prime minister arseniy p yatsenyuk a veteran public official who has served as parliament speaker foreign minister economics minister and acting head of the central bank the leaders also announced the dissolution of the countrys widely despised riot police force the berkut whose officers were blamed for shooting demonstrators last week in kievs central independence square berkut is gone the acting interior minister arsen avakov announced in a posting on facebook general shoigu announced the snap exercise during a meeting of russias general staff citing the need to test the readiness of russias armed forces to respond to a crisis situation including a terrorist attack involving biological or chemical weapons senior defense and government officials later said the exercise was not related to the events in ukraine which officials here have watched with growing alarm but they also said there was no reason to postpone them either and the geopolitical message was clear i think it is flag waving but its more than that also dmitri trenin the director of the moscow carnegie center said after the announcement of the exercise its a message to kiev not to impose its rule in crimea by force mr trenin warned that the exercise could have the opposite effect rallying ukrainians against russia if the countrys territorial integrity appeared threatened russia has refused so far to recognize the legitimacy of the new political powers in ukraines parliament and denounced their actions since mr yanukovychs flight as inflammatory and divisive including what the foreign ministry described on wednesday as discrimination toward russian orthodox believers two days earlier prime minister dmitri a medvedev said the turmoil posed a real threat to our interests and to our citizens lives and health the crimea has been a particular focus of concern among russian lawmakers many of whom share the sentiment that the region is culturally and historically russian not ukrainian the black sea fleet maintains its headquarters in the port of sevastopol under a lease that mr yanukovychs government extended until 2042 after a riotous debate in ukraines parliament in 2010 mr yanukovych the object of a nationwide manhunt in ukraine had been believed to be in hiding in crimea after he bolted from kiev on saturday two russian news agencies citing unidentified sources reported wednesday night that he had arrived in moscow other officials dismissed the reports i know definitely that yanukovych is not in russia said mikhail v margelov the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of russias upper house of parliament mr putins spokesman dmitri s peskov said he had no information on mr yanukovychs whereabouts mr putin himself has yet to make public remarks on the crisis in ukraine but senior officials have vowed not to interfere directly and called on the united states and europe to do the same even so the public clamor of ethnic russians in the crimea and eastern ukraine has raised fears that russia could be provoked to intervene such a scenario is impossible valentina i matviyenko the chairman of russias upper house of parliament said on wednesday according to the interfax news agency russias military exercise will involve nearly 150000 troops including the entire western military district one of four across the country as well as hundreds of tanks and artillery batteries and dozens of aircraft and ships the deputy defense minister anatoly i antonov said according to interfax the district headquartered in st petersburg stretches along the border of northeastern ukraine and includes the 6th and 20th armies the exercise will also involve the 2nd army in the central military district as well as airborne aerospace and military transport commands mr antonov informed the military attachés of several nations of the exercise including the united states as required by an agreement negotiated in 2011 and known as the vienna document aleksandr golts an independent military analyst in moscow said that the exercise theoretically could — and he emphasized the word theoretically — disguise a more general mobilization of russias military in case a conflict erupted over ukraine in my view its very bad even if there are no plans to use the military that maneuvers are being held with the goal of testing the nerves of others he said that these maneuvers will increase the tenseness of this situation — that is not even a question since mr putin returned to the presidency for a third term in 2012 he has sought to refurbish and modernize the countrys military which remains reliant on conscripts despite proposed reforms over the years by increasing spending for weapons and benefits russia conducted a similar exercise last year in the eastern military district which extends across siberia to the pacific coast it was described as the largest single military drill since the collapse of the soviet union more than two decades ago the military also held smaller exercises in southern russia ahead of the olympic games in sochi general shoigu in his remarks made clear that russias military ambitions extended beyond its borders he said that russia intended to expand its military operations and presence globally by holding negotiations with nicaragua venezuela singapore and the seychelles to provide logistical support for strategic air patrols we need refueling bases either in the area of the equator or elsewhere he said according to interfax source the new york times",

placating a frustrated russian leader who sees ukraine as a vital part of his strategy to rebuild russian influence not along the lines of the former soviet union but of the czars while few analysts expected a russian military intervention in ukraine most said that mr putin was likely to respond in some fashion to such a stinging geopolitical defeat the question was how and on wednesday he provided a first answer when russias military put tens of thousands of troops in western russia on alert at 2 pm for an exercise scheduled to last until march 3 the minister of defense sergei k shoigu

for the russians to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of ukraine mr kerry did not specify what the united states was prepared to do in response to a russian military intervention focusing instead on what he said the russians would sacrifice i think it would cost them hugely in the world where they are trying to assert a sort of greater legitimacy with respect to their diplomacy he said mr kerry also said that the united states was considering a 1 billion package of loan guarantees to ukraine as well as direct aid to the ukrainian government to help address the deepening economic crisis there russia has refused so far to recognize the legitimacy of the new political powers in ukraines parliament and denounced their actions since mr yanukovychs flight as inflammatory and divisive including what the foreign ministry described on wednesday as discrimination toward russian orthodox believers two days earlier prime minister dmitri a medvedev said the turmoil posed a real threat to our interests and to our citizens lives and health mr putin himself has yet to make public remarks on the crisis in ukraine but senior officials have vowed not to interfere directly and called on the united states and europe to do the same even so the public clamor of ethnic russians in crimea and eastern ukraine has raised fears that russia could be provoked to intervene alan cowell contributed reporting from london and michael r gordon from washington",

wants him to do no matter how embarrassing the uss vote may well go to russia or maybe it will be an abstention china will support russia the uk will do whatever obama tells it to do and france fearful of having its gas cut off will probably support russia or abstain of the 10 nonpermanent security council members including luxemburg chad and rwanda their best strategy would be to not get on

adding we are not looking for confrontation but we are making it clear that every country should respect the territorial integrity here the sovereignty of ukraine russia has said it would do that and we think its important that russia keeps its word later he added it would be a grave mistake for russia to intervene militarily in ukraine for a country that has spoken out so frequently against foreign intervention in libya in syria and elsewhere it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of ukraine he said i dont think there should be any doubt whatsoever that any kind of military intervention that would violate the sovereign territorial integrity of ukraine would be a huge a grave mistake he added if there were any kind of decision like that i do not think thats a cheap decision i think its a very expensive decision mr kerry also held out the possibility of providing 1 billion in us loan guarantees for ukraine as well as us budget support for the former soviet republic but said no decisions had been made meanwhile nato defence ministers warned that they considered ukraines future to be key to euroatlantic security and assured the new government in kiev that the alliance would back its sovereignty independence and territorial integrity a sovereign independent and stable ukraine firmly committed to democracy and the rule of law is key to euroatlantic security they said in a statement the comments appear to be a direct response to sabre rattling by highranking russian officials including dmitry

parliament disbanded the berkut a special riot police unit that is blamed for much of the violence against protesters during the twoandahalf months of street confrontations that led to mr yanukovychs

instead zevdjet kurtumerov a tatar protester sadi moscows attitude is complete imperialism wherever they put their boots it is russia but this is our ukraine and we want to keep it but ethnic russians who account for about 60 per cent of the population on the peninsula see russia as a guarantor of stability and see the tatars as a pushing an essentially racist agenda they want crimea to be a tatar

as thousands of prorussia demonstrators confronted muslim crimean tatars backing the new ukrainian leadership the obama administration said any russian military intervention in ukraine would be a costly and grave mistake russias military put tens of thousands of troops in western russia on alert at 2 pm for an exercise scheduled to last until march 3 the minister of defense sergei k shoigu also announced unspecified measures to tighten security at the headquarters of russias black sea fleet on ukraines crimea peninsula the orders came as thousands of ethnic russians gathered outside the regional parliament in crimeas capital simferopol to protest the political upheaval in ukraines capital kiev that felled the government of president viktor f yanukovych over the weekend and turned him into a fugitive crimea was a part of russian territory until the soviet union ceded it to the soviet socialist republic of ukraine in 1954 and russians there have already pleaded for the kremlins intervention to protect the region and its population from ukraines new leadership crimea is russian some of the protesters screamed as brawls erupted with rival demonstrations by crimeas ethnic tatars supporting the new interim authorities while the military maneuvers were largely seen as saberrattling and not a precursor to armed intervention they elicited new warnings from western governments notably the united states which reminded russia of its own admonishments to the west about bigpower military adventurism speaking to a small group of reporters in washington secretary of state john kerry said it was important for the russians to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of ukraine and i dont think there should be any doubt whatsoever that any kind of military intervention that would violate the sovereign territorial integrity of ukraine would be a huge a grave mistake mr kerry did not specify what the united states was prepared to do in response to a russian military intervention focusing instead on what he said the russians would sacrifice i think it would cost them hugely in the world where they are trying to assert a sort of greater legitimacy with respect to their diplomacy he said that would blow it into shreds but mr kerry asserted that the united states did not see ukraine a eastwest battleground sayingthis is not rocky iv mr kerry also said the united states was considering a 1 billion package of loan guarantees to ukraine to help address the deepening economic crisis there as the interim leaders scrambled on wednesday to form a new government able to find ways out of an impending default they chose as prime minister arseniy p yatsenyuk a veteran public official who has served as parliament speaker foreign minister economics minister and acting head of the central bank the leaders also announced the dissolution of the countrys widely despised riot police force the berkut whose officers were blamed for shooting demonstrators last week in kievs central independence square berkut is gone the acting interior minister arsen avakov announced in a posting on facebook general shoigu announced the snap exercise during a meeting of russias general staff citing the need to test the readiness of russias armed forces to respond to a crisis situation including a terrorist attack involving biological or chemical weapons senior defense and government officials later said the exercise was not related to the events in ukraine which officials here have watched with growing alarm but they also said there was no reason to postpone them either and the geopolitical message was clear i think it is flag waving but its more than that also dmitri trenin the director of the moscow carnegie center said after the announcement of the exercise its a message to kiev not to impose its rule in crimea by force mr trenin warned that the exercise could have the opposite effect rallying ukrainians against russia if the countrys territorial integrity appeared threatened russia has refused so far to recognize the legitimacy of the new political powers in ukraines parliament and denounced their actions since mr yanukovychs flight as inflammatory and divisive including what the foreign ministry described on wednesday as discrimination toward russian orthodox believers two days earlier prime minister dmitri a medvedev said the turmoil posed a real threat to our interests and to our citizens lives and health the crimea has been a particular focus of concern among russian lawmakers many of whom share the sentiment that the region is culturally and historically russian not ukrainian the black sea fleet maintains its headquarters in the port of sevastopol under a lease that mr yanukovychs government extended until 2042 after a riotous debate in ukraines parliament in 2010 mr yanukovych the object of a nationwide manhunt in ukraine had been believed to be in hiding in crimea after he bolted from kiev on saturday two russian news agencies citing unidentified sources reported wednesday night that he had arrived in moscow other officials dismissed the reports i know definitely that yanukovych is not in russia said mikhail v margelov the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of russias upper house of parliament mr putins spokesman dmitri s peskov said he had no information on mr yanukovychs whereabouts mr putin himself has yet to make public remarks on the crisis in ukraine but senior officials have vowed not to interfere directly and called on the united states and europe to do the same even so the public clamor of ethnic russians in the crimea and eastern ukraine has raised fears that russia could be provoked to intervene such a scenario is impossible valentina i matviyenko the chairman of russias upper house of parliament said on wednesday according to the interfax news agency russias military exercise will involve nearly 150000 troops including the entire western military district one of four across the country as well as hundreds of tanks and artillery batteries and dozens of aircraft and ships the deputy defense minister anatoly i antonov said according to interfax the district headquartered in st petersburg stretches along the border of northeastern ukraine and includes the 6th and 20th armies the exercise will also involve the 2nd army in the central military district as well as airborne aerospace and military transport commands mr antonov informed the military attachés of several nations of the exercise including the united states as required by an agreement negotiated in 2011 and known as the vienna document aleksandr golts an independent military analyst in moscow said that the exercise theoretically could — and he emphasized the word theoretically — disguise a more general mobilization of russias military in case a conflict erupted over ukraine in my view its very bad even if there are no plans to use the military that maneuvers are being held with the goal of testing the nerves of others he said that these maneuvers will increase the tenseness of this situation — that is not even a question since mr putin returned to the presidency for a third term in 2012 he has sought to refurbish and modernize the countrys military which remains reliant on conscripts despite proposed reforms over the years by increasing spending for weapons and benefits russia conducted a similar exercise last year in the eastern military district which extends across siberia to the pacific coast it was described as the largest single military drill since the collapse of the soviet union more than two decades ago the military also held smaller exercises in southern russia ahead of the olympic games in sochi general shoigu in his remarks made clear that russias military ambitions extended beyond its borders he said that russia intended to expand its military operations and presence globally by holding negotiations with nicaragua venezuela singapore and the seychelles to provide logistical support for strategic air patrols we need refueling bases either in the area of the equator or elsewhere he said according to interfax source the new york times",

global gold prices may have been manipulated on 50 percent of occasions between january 2010 and december 2013 according to analysis by fideres a consultancy the findings come amid a probe by german and uk regulators into alleged manipulation of the gold price which is set twice a day by deutsche bank hsbc barclays bank of nova scotia and societe generale in a process known as the london gold fixing fideres research found the gold price frequently climbs or falls once a twicedaily conference call between the five banks begins peaks or troughs almost exactly as the call ends and then experiences a sharp reversal a pattern it alleged may be evidence of collusive behavior this is indicative of panel banks pushing the gold price upwards on the basis of a strategy that was likely predetermined before the start of the call in order to benefit their existing positions or pending orders fideres concluded the behavior of the gold price is very suspicious in 50 percent of cases this is not something you would expect to see if you take into account normal market factors said alberto thomas a partner at fideres alasdair macleod head of research at goldmoney a dealer in

phase of the ukraine crisis a prorussian demonstrator waves russian and crimea flags from an old soviet army tank credit ap photodarko vojinovic after last weeks dramatic events in ukraine and the end of the protests that had paralyzed the former soviet country since november it appeared for a brief moment like the crisis in ukraine might be coming to a halt instead the focal point of the narrative has shifted from the capital kyiv to the peninsula known as crimea crimea the countrys only autonomous province has been the site of various degrees of separatist rumblings ranging from calls for greater autonomy from the new government in kyiv to promoting outright annexation into the russian federation heres what you need to know as the region decides if its going to continue to march to the same beat as the rest of ukraine 1 theres a large ethnically russian population within crimea the political crisis was setoff when former ukrainian president viktor yanukovych rejected a series of deals that would have strengthened ties with the european union last november since then the aftermath has played out — broadly speaking — between proeuropean forces in the west of the country and prorussian masses in the east where russian is frequently spoken instead of ukrainian out of all of the east the divide has been most apparent in crimea which has numerous ties to the russian federation — enough that the region is being considered the next flashpoint in the crisis the majority of the concern is based on the fact that crimea is home to a population that is about 60 percent ethnically russian according to the most recent census the new york times has mapped what percentage of native russian and ukrainian speakers live in any given region of the country including crimea crimea is also where you can find sevastopol a city to the south of the region where russias black sea fleet docks thanks to a lease that is due to last until at least 2042 the exact effect of the eastwest divide in the escalation of the events has been under debate in recent days given the imprecise measure that charting the linguistic divide has proven as has the narrative of just how much russian nationalism is present within crimea theres also the 15 to 20 percent of the population who are ethnic tartars — majority muslim and mistreated under the soviet government they have no love for russia and support the interim government in kyiv but the split between promoscow and prokyiv could matter more when it comes to crimea than the rest of the country according to institute of modern russia fellow michael weiss what the media has rather glibly been defining for months as a geographical or ethnolinguistic eastwest split for ukraine as a whole might actually be better applied to crimea he writes but here it runs along a northsouth divide with prorussian concentrations more heavily distributed closer to the black sea 2 crimea doesnt appear pleased with the removal of yanukovych last week even before the surprising events of last week that saw the ukrainian parliament vote to remove yanukovych from power crimea seemed to be a hotbed of support for the embattled leader — and of russia itself volodymyr konstantinov speaker of crimeas parliament last thursday told russian news agency interfax that in the event ukraine split apart it would be possible that the region would seek annexation into russia it is possible if the country breaks apart he said and everything is moving towards that a report from radio free europe also showed that prorussian nationalist sentiment is on the rise following the onset of the protests in kyiv this is the result of a political position to deny russians for whom the language is the main identifier of their russian ethnicity of their russian nation russian people crimean parliament deputy sergei shuvainikov said to deny them the right to remind children and young people that they are russians it is in fact the destruction of russian nationality of the concept of the russian people of ukraine while the seriousness of the separatist rhetoric has been questioned reality interceded on thursday when armed men stormed the crimean parliament and raised a russian flag over the building we are not separatists russia ukraine and belarus are one country shouted a man on the scene through a bullhorn according to the new york times andrew higgens as night fell on ukraine the men still held the building even as the local government continued to work including voting for a referendum among crimeas population on the widening of the authority of the autonomous republic of crimea precisely what that means is unclear but the vote is scheduled to be held on may 25 — the same day that ukraine is due to vote for a new president the resolution also dismissed the regions current government which has backed the interim government in kyiv 3 unrest in crimea may drag russia further in to the crisis if you think that a lot of this comes back to russia youre right the fact is that ukraine is making headlines not just for the human rights concerns seen when the government was assaulting civilians but the strategic role ukraine plays in the region caught in a tugofwar between russia and the west while moscow has taken more of a backseat than many would expect during the last few months events separatist moves from crimea — or overenthusiasm from kyiv to show they still control the region — could force russia to get more involved last week a russian official went so far as to tell financial times that they were willing to go to war to protect the ethnic russians living in crimea if ukraine breaks apart it will trigger a war the official said they will lose crimea first because we will go in and protect it just as we did in georgia that statement in conjunction with the surprise military exercises that russian president vladimir putin announced on wednesday russia has denied that the snap training announcement has anything to do with the unrest across the border but that hasnt stopped comparisons from being drawn between ukraine and the shortlived war between georgia and russia in 2008 then moscow sent forces across the border into the separatist regions of south ossetia and abkhazia to protect them in their bid for greater independence from georgia while the odds of such an event repeating in ukraine seem low even skeptics like the dmitri trenin director of the carnegie institutes moscow center are beginning to see the possibility one can easily imagine a harsh russian response if kyiv takes rash steps to reassert its authority in crimea either by sending in troops or by allowing revolutionary paramilitaries to launch a peoples march on crimea he wrote along with the centers vice president for studies andrew weiss a hot war between russia and ukraine would have farreaching and highly destabilizing consequences and a transformative effect on russias relations with the west no effort should be spared to promote a rapid deescalation of the situation on the ground adding to the intrigue yanukovych on thursday announced that he would be holding a press conference on friday from the russian city rostovondon despite being referred to in the past tense by the us and other foreign government yanukovych has maintained that he remains ukraines president that hasnt stopped the interim government in kyiv from setting up an interim government including electing a speaker and attempting to restore order after months of political chaos",

Police officers sealed off access to the buildings but said that they had no idea who was behind the assault, which sharply escalated tensions in a region that serves as home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and also to a number of radical pro-Russia groups that have appealed to Moscow to protect them from the new interim government in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.\n\nNobody credibly claims to know who these Russian-flagged armed men are.\n\nFrom the Russian point of view, the Ukrainians have no claim whatsoever to the Crimea, and their point of view has strong historical legitimacy. The Crimea was part of the crumbling Ottoman Empire that crumbled off as an independent khanate; at the time of the American Revolution, the khans fell into the Russian orbit and the peninsula was annexed. It is one of those places that “produces more history than the locals can consume.”\n\nIn the West, the Crimea is famous as the location of a nasty European war in the 1850s, with a French-English alliance fighting the Russians and the peninsula as battlefield (this is the war that produced the Charge of the Light Brigade at Balaklava, which has gone down in history as a much better poem than it was a military operation). In the Russian Civil War, the Crimea was a White Russian stronghold until 1920, when White general Peter Wrangel and many of his men fled into exile (those that stayed to surrender were, in a sign of things to come in the Red regime, murdered). The same Red Army buried a nascent Ukrainian Republic at the same time.\n\nThe captured Crimea was part of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic and remained so. In World War II, the Germans and Soviets fought for the peninsula. When the Soviets retook it in 1944, Stalin declared the Tatars and other non-Russian minorities on the peninsula to be collaborators. (The Nazis did raise 9 battalions of Tatar troops, who were presumably not among the ones waiting for Stalin’s mercy in 1944). Those that were not killed outright were exiled to Siberia, and for most of them, doom; their property given to ethnic Russians or seized by the State. By 1945 the population of the Crimea was 100% ethnic Russian or Ukrainian. The survivors of the Tatars remained exiled until the fall of the USSR; all Tatars on the peninsula, some 16% of the population now, are returned survivors of expropriated exiles.\n\nThat Crimea, which was always Russian, is part of Ukraine is the result of a 1954 decison by the Supreme Soviet, when the borders of Soviet republics represented little more than lines on a map, and it seemed to tidy the map to move a nominally autonomous zone from one republic to another (in the Soviet context. “autonomous” means it had the trappings of local government). The peninsula is today a nominally autonomous republic within Ukraine, with its own unicameral legislature, in which Yanukovych’s ethnic-Russian Party of Regions holds almost 90 of the 100 seats.\n\nLawyers are known to say, “hard cases make bad law.” This is truly a hard case. Both sides have what lawyers (them, again!) would call a “colorable argument.” And both sides have reasons, both historical and present-day, to mistrust the other.\n\nWatch for the appearance of of a weaselly character named Viktor Volodymyrovich Medvedchuk as a “compromise”. Medvedchuk is the son of a Nazi collaborator, and he himself is a former small-time criminal and secret police snitch, who became a lawyer. As a lawyer, he’s one of that  98% minority that gives the honest ones a bad name.\n\nHe was a defense attorney in Soviet-era show trials, where his function was to join the prosecution in denouncing his own client. He claims to be personally close to Putin, and while involved in Ukrainian post-independence politics both managed to enrich himself and ingratiate himself with the Russian security services.",

            "text": "Simferopol (Ukraine), Feb. 27: Masked gunmen today seized government buildings in the capital of the Crimea region of Ukraine, barricaded themselves inside and raised the Russian flag, raising the spectre of a separatist rebellion that could tear the country apart. Further inflaming an increasingly volatile situation, Viktor F. Yanukovich released a statement today saying that he remained the lawful President of Ukraine and appealed to Russia to protect “my personal safety”. While his precise whereabouts remained a mystery, Russian news agencies reported subsequently that Yanukovich would hold a news conference in Rostov-on-Don, a city in southern Russia, six days after he was driven from power by mass protests and fled from Kiev, the Ukrainian capital. Local police officers in Simferopol, the Crimean regional capital, sealed off access to the government buildings, including the regional Parliament, which were seized in mysterious overnight raids by people who appeared to be militant ethnic Russians. Crimea has been a source of tension between Ukraine and Russia for decades: the territory was transferred to Ukraine by the Russian Federation when they were both components of the Soviet Union in 1954, and Ukraine retained it when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Russia still maintains important military bases there, including the home port of the Black Sea Fleet. Oleksandr V. Turchynov, the speaker of Parliament and acting President of Ukraine, urged Russian military forces early today not to stray out of the designated Russian military zones. “I am addressing the Russian Black Sea Fleet command with a demand: all military servicemen should stay within the boundaries of of the territories stipulated by agreement,” Turchynov said as he presided over the Parliament. “Any movement of military servicemen with weapons outside this territory will be viewed as military aggression.” Arsen Avakov, Ukraine’s acting interior minister, said that the new government was taking unspecified measures “to counter the extremists’ actions and prevent an escalation of an armed conflict in the centre of the city”. It was unclear, however, how much authority Avakov has over the police and other government agencies in Crimea, where many in the heavily ethnic Russian population view the ouster of Yanukovich as a fascist coup. “Provocateurs are on the march,” Avakov said, making his announcement, as he has others, on his Facebook account. “It’s a time for cool heads, the healthy consolidation of forces, and careful action.” In his statement, Yanukovich warned that the largely Russian regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, including Crimea, would “not accept the anarchy and outright lawlessness” that has gripped the country. “I continue to consider myself the lawful head of the Ukrainian government, elected on the basis of the free expression of the will of Ukrainian citizens,” he said in the statement, according to two news agencies, RIA Novosti and Itar-Tass. “I cannot be indifferent to the tragic events in my homeland.” Whether he can cling to any part of his former power remains far from clear. Members of his own party have deserted him, and the Ukrainian Parliament impeached him and moved today to approve an interim government, with elections for a new President planned for May. Yanukovich’s remarks were his first since Saturday, when he appeared in a video that apparently was recorded in his political base in eastern Ukraine. Even in his diminished and humiliated position, with journalists and ordinary people traipsing through his presidential palace and sorting through incriminating records, Yanukovich asserted his authority over the country’s armed forces. “I, as the actual President, have not allowed the armed forces of Ukraine to interfere in the ongoing internal political events,” he said, contradicting reports that he had ordered the military to intervene in Kiev, only to have his order rebuffed.",

grave mistake as troops in western russia were placed on high alert for massive new war games in the area including near the russianukrainian border in delivering the blunt message secretary of state john kerry also announced that the obama administration was planning 1 billion in loan guarantees for ukraine and would consider additional direct assistance for the former soviet republic following unrest that led to the ouster of its russianbacked president kerry also renewed us demands that moscow withdraw troops from disputed enclaves in another former soviet republic georgia and urged georgia to further integrate with europe and nato the warning aid announcement and nudge westward for georgia all came amid growing tensions between russia and the west over ukraine and were likely to fuel alreadyheightened russian suspicions over western intentions in its backyard kerry insisted however that that us policy toward ukraine georgia and the other states that once made up the soviet union was not aimed at reducing russias influence in its neighborhood instead he maintained that us encouragement for former soviet states to integrate with the west was driven by americas desire to see their people realize aspirations for freedom in robust democracies with strong economies this is not rocky iv kerry said referring to the iconic 1985 sylvester stallone film in which an aging american boxer takes on a daunting soviet muscleman it is not a zerosum game we do not view it through the lens of eastwest russiaus or anything else we view it as an example of people within a

in what many see as a show of force or possible prelude to intervention in ukraine kerry said it would be hypocritical for moscow to send troops into another country after spending the last several years opposing foreign military action in places like libya and syria for a country that has spoken out so frequently in the last year against foreign intervention in libya syria elsewhere it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of ukraine kerry said any kind of military intervention that would violate the sovereign territorial

accompanied by additional aid to be determined later in consultation with congress as well as about 15 billion from the european union along with loans from global financial institutions kerry made the comments in a roundtable interview with a small group of reporters at the state department where he presided over a meeting of the usgeorgia strategic partnership commission earlier wednesday at that meeting he announced additional but unspecified us assistance to help support georgias european and euroatlantic vision and he denounced russias continued military presence in the breakaway

opposed by russia — and wants to see it sign a partnership agreement with the european union later this year a similar proposed agreement between ukraine and the eu was among the catalysts that led to the deadly unrest in kiev that unseated russianbacked president viktor yanukovych last week some russian officials accuse the west of being behind the revolt against yanukovych us and european

            "text": "Armed men just seized government buildings in Simferopol, the capital of Ukraine’s autonomous Crimea region, raising the Russian flag above the parliament building and refusing to allow workers in (NYT):\n\nPolice officers sealed off access to the buildings but said that they had no idea who was behind the assault, which sharply escalated tensions in a region that serves as home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and also to a number of radical pro-Russia groups that have appealed to Moscow to protect them from the new interim government in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.\n\nThe Lede is live-blogging. Simon Shuster puts the event in context:\n\nSince revolutionaries took over Ukraine’s capital a week ago, the ethnic Russian majority in the Crimea has largely refused to recognize the new government. In some Crimean cities, citizens have begun forming pro-Russian militias to resist the new authorities. “There’s not a chance in hell we’re going to accept the rule of that fascist scum,” Sergei Bochenko, the commander of a local militia group in the Crimea, told TIME last week in the city of Sevastopol. He said his battalion was armed with assault rifles and had begun training to “defend our land.”\n\nTatyana Malyarenko and Stefan Wolff take a wider look at Crimean separatism:\n\nSeparatist forces have a broad social base in Crimea. Available polling data since 2006 has consistently indicated that more than 50% of residents in the peninsula would support annexation to Russia. These figures suggest a strong pro-Russian sentiment among the region’s ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking Ukrainians, but not one that has so far automatically translated into an active pursuit of separatism. At the same time, there are also strong anti-separatist forces in Crimea, notably the Crimean Tatars, who make up approximately 12% of the peninsula’s population. One of the Soviet Union’s nationalities that experienced deportation under Stalin, they have gradually returned to the Crimea since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. While they have continued to experience ethnic prejudice and discrimination in Ukraine, they are, for obvious historical reasons, fundamentally opposed to Crimea “returning” to Russia. Meanwhile, Yanukovych is seeking refuge in Moscow: Russian newspaper RBK reported on Thursday that ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was spotted at a Moscow hotel and is currently staying at a state-run sanatorium nearby. Although, his presence in Russia is still unconfirmed, the paper carried Yanukovych’s plea for protection from the Kremlin. “I have to ask Russia to ensure my personal safety from extremists,” he wrote. Despite fleeing, he still insists that he is still the rightful leader of Ukraine. And, as we noted yesterday, Russia is carrying out military exercises not far from Ukraine: Okay, so according to Ria Novosti, more than 150,000 troops are due to take part in the drills, as well as 90 planes and more than 120 helicopters. While we don’t know precisely where the troops will be, Moscow has said the drills would happen in the Western and Central military districts. … [W]hile the Western district does border Ukraine, it also covers a huge amount of other land, too. It is possible that some of the troops in this district may be relatively close to Ukraine: According to the Wall Street Journal, the 20th Army, based about 200 miles from the border, is listed to be involved in ”operational and tactical exercises.” On the other hand, the military district in the South is the only one that borders Crimea, and Russia says it is not the part of the drill at all. Ed Morrissey fears that Putin is laying the groundwork for intervention: For the moment, he’s still playing his cards close to the vest; he’s agreed to sit down for IMF discussions on a Ukraine bailout to take the place of the one Putin suspended, for instance. Yanukovich is simply a clown show, though, as his credibility in Ukraine is shot, and Putin knows it. The Crimean peninsula will be the flashpoint for any action, and it’s not long odds on Ukraine losing it, either diplomatically or otherwise. But Timothy Snyder warns that meddling in Crimea would be dangerous for Russia, setting a “rather troubling precedent” for similar meddling by China in the east.",

of us to respect that path he insisted the top priority for the interim ukraine leadership that has taken over after the exit of president viktor yanukovych was forming a new inclusive government as he revealed that the united states was formulating initially a 1 billion loan guarantee with some other pieces in aid the european union was also looking at offering us15 billion a168 billion in loan

be a grave mistake although he was reluctant to say what the international response would be to any such military steps he hinted there could be moves to take any such intervention to the united nations russian defence minister sergei shoigu said earlier that moscow was taking measures to ensure the security of its black sea naval fleet based on ukraines southern crimean peninsula sevastopol which has hosted the black sea fleet since tsarist times has witnessed several prorussian demonstrations in recent days with hundreds rallying outside city hall yesterday for a country that has spoken out so frequently in the last year and so strongly against foreign intervention in libya and syria and elsewhere it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think about options in

factions on the volatile crimean peninsula and russian president vladimir putin ordered snap military drills near the border with the exsoviet state kiev is grappling with the dual threats of separatism and economic default as it tries to recover from three months of protests that triggered prorussian president viktor yanukovychs ouster following a week of carnage in which nearly 100

people on kievs independence square the heart of ukraines worst protests since independence in 1991 but the wave of secessionist sentiment that gripped the russified southeastern parts of ukraine

one man died of a heart attack during the mayhem in the port town of simferopol while several were injured in scuffles that involved pepper spray and saw several bottles being hurled meanwhile mr

commanderinchief has set the task of checking the capability of the armed forces to deal with crisis situations posing a threat to the military security of the country defence minister sergei shoigu said he also announced russia was taking measures to ensure the security of its black sea naval fleet based in crimea — a scenic peninsula that had answered to moscow for centuries until being handed to the ukrainian soviet republic as a gift in 1954 russia has been venting daily outrage at the meteoric turn of events in a neighbour that mr putin views as vital to his dream of building a postsoviet alliance that could rival the eu and nato blocs us secretary of state john kerry attempted to ward off any ambitions mr putin may have to use force to alter the political outcome in kiev we are making it clear that every country should respect the territorial integrity here the sovereignty of ukraine russia said it will do that and we think it is important russia keeps its word mr kerry stressed the interim governments headaches have been compounded by moscows decision to freeze a massive bailout package that mr putin promised to mr yanukovych as his reward for rejecting closer eu ties in a surprise november decision that sparked the mass protests fears of a catastrophic default by ukraine — which is seeking 35 billion in western aid to keep functioning — saw the local currency sink four per cent and reach a record low against the dollar the deposed mr yanukovych — who is wanted for mass murder is widely believed to have gone into hiding in crimea with his two sons and a small team of heavilyarmed guards the new interim prosecutor general insisted that mr yanukovych was still in ukraine while also requesting an international arrest warrant for both the fugitive exleader and the ousted interior minister vitaliy zakharchenko — a hate figure among protesters for ordering the deadly use of force there was further confusion when mr putins spokesman was forced to say he had no information about a private russian tv report claiming that mr yanukovych was hiding out in a government health resort near moscow called barvikha the rbk channel cited an unnamed major russian businessman as its source and said the information had been confirmed by a highranking russian official top among interim president oleksandr turchynovs concerns are fears of mob violence in

prorussian regions such as mr yanukovychs native industrial base of donetsk three of ukraines postsoviet leaders issued a joint statement accusing russia of resorting to direct intervention in the

tymoshenko walk free the whereabouts of viktor yanukovych remained a mystery after authorities claimed they had prevented the embattled leader from escaping the country and said he may be hiding out in the east which is broadly prorussian and where concerns remain over the potential for unrest and while life creaked back to normal in central kiev for antiyanukovych protesters occupying the capitals independence square—where curious onlookers paid their respects to those who died under police fire this week—the focus abroad shifted to rebuilding a battered country on the verge of default at a g20 gathering in sydney the us and international monetary fund imf offered to assist ukraine in rebuilding its economy following a threemonth protest movement that dramatically escalated this week with the deaths of nearly 100 people in clashes between demonstrators and security forces us treasury secretary jacob lew emphasised that the us working with other countries including russia stands ready to assist ukraine as it implements reforms to restore economic stability and seeks to return to a path of democracy and growth fears that ukraines debtladen economy is facing default have sparked panic on markets with bond yields rising sharply and the hryvnia currency losing a tenth of its value in the span of a few weeks dizzying political changes a new interim government could be announced sunday in ukraine where residents were still reeling from the dizzying changes unleashed over the past week as a mainly peaceful protest movement turned deadly the spiralling crisis prompted yanukovych to sign a westernbrokered peace deal on friday with the opposition which then took over parliament and ushered in huge political changes—including a vote to free tymoshenko the fiery 53yearold hero of the 2004 prodemocracy orange revolution yanukovychs archnemesis tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in jail for abuse of power after his election in 2010 shortly after the

by an emotional 50000strong crowd hailing the end of a dictatorship she said in a tearful voice late in the evening you are heroes you are the best of ukraine i did not recognise kiev the burnt cars the barricades the flowers but its another ukraine the ukraine of free men she said sitting in a wheelchair suffering from chronic back problems her face drawn after twoandahalf years in jail her appearance on the square would have been unthinkable just a few days ago much like the fate of yanukovych himself on saturday police parliamentary allies and members of his regions party deserted the president one by one the army issued a statement saying it will in no way become involved in the political conflict and the police force declared itself in support of the people and rapid change

state john kerry said it was important for the russians to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of ukraine and i dont think there should be any doubt whatsoever that any kind of military intervention that would violate the sovereign territorial integrity of ukraine would be a huge – a grave mistake mr kerry did not specify what the united states was prepared to do in response to a russian military intervention focusing instead on what he said the russians would sacrifice i think it would cost them hugely in the world where they are trying to assert a sort of greater legitimacy with respect to their diplomacy he said that would blow it into shreds but mr kerry asserted that the united states did not see ukraine a eastwest battleground sayingthis is not rocky iv mr kerry also said the united states was considering a 1 billion package of loan guarantees to ukraine to help address the deepening economic crisis there as the interim leaders scrambled on wednesday to form a new government able to find ways out of an impending default they chose as prime minister arseniy p yatsenyuk a veteran public official who has served as parliament speaker foreign minister economics minister and acting head of the central bank the leaders also announced the dissolution of the countrys widely despised riot police force the berkut whose officers were blamed for shooting demonstrators last week in kievs central independence square berkut is gone the acting interior minister arsen avakov announced in a posting on facebook general shoigu announced the snap exercise during a meeting of russias general staff citing the need to test the readiness of russias armed forces to respond to a crisis situation including a terrorist attack involving biological or chemical weapons senior defense and government officials later said the exercise was not related to the events in ukraine which officials here have watched with growing alarm but they also said there was no reason to postpone them either and the geopolitical message was clear i think it is flag waving but its more than that also dmitri trenin the director of the moscow carnegie center said after the announcement of the exercise its a message to kiev not to impose its rule in crimea by force mr trenin warned that the exercise could have the opposite effect rallying ukrainians against russia if the countrys territorial integrity appeared threatened russia has refused so far to recognize the legitimacy of the new political powers in ukraines parliament and denounced their actions since mr yanukovychs flight as inflammatory and divisive including what the foreign ministry described on wednesday as discrimination toward russian orthodox believers two days earlier prime minister dmitri a medvedev said the turmoil posed a real threat to our interests and to our citizens lives and health the crimea has been a particular focus of concern among russian lawmakers many of whom share the sentiment that the region is culturally and historically russian not ukrainian the black sea fleet maintains its headquarters in the port of sevastopol under a lease that mr yanukovychs government extended until 2042 after a riotous debate in ukraines parliament in 2010 mr yanukovych the object of a nationwide manhunt in ukraine had been believed to be in hiding in crimea after he bolted from kiev on saturday two russian news agencies citing unidentified sources reported wednesday night that he had arrived in moscow other officials dismissed the reports i know definitely that yanukovych is not in russia said mikhail v margelov the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of russias upper house of parliament mr putins spokesman dmitri s peskov said he had no information on mr yanukovychs whereabouts mr putin himself has yet to make public remarks on the crisis in ukraine but senior officials have vowed not to interfere directly and called on the united states and europe to do the same even so the public clamor of ethnic russians in the crimea and eastern ukraine has raised fears that russia could be provoked to intervene such a scenario is impossible valentina i matviyenko the chairman of russias upper house of parliament said on wednesday according to the interfax news agency russias military exercise will involve nearly 150000 troops including the entire western military district one of four across the country as well as hundreds of tanks and artillery batteries and dozens of aircraft and ships the deputy defense minister anatoly i antonov said according to interfax the district headquartered in st petersburg stretches along the border of northeastern ukraine and includes the 6th and 20th armies the exercise will also involve the 2nd army in the central military district as well as airborne aerospace and military transport commands mr antonov informed the military attachés of several nations of the exercise including the united states as required by an agreement negotiated in 2011 and known as the vienna document aleksandr golts an independent military analyst in moscow said that the exercise theoretically could — and he emphasized the word theoretically — disguise a more general mobilization of russias military in case a conflict erupted over ukraine in my view its very bad even if there are no plans to use the military that maneuvers are being held with the goal of testing the nerves of others he said that these maneuvers will increase the tenseness of this situation — that is not even a question keep reading",

by a mob russian news agencies quoted a statement by yanukovych as saying he had asked moscow to guarantee his personal safety the statement could not be independently verified and it was not clear

putin ordered an urgent drill of his countrys armed forces in western russia in what appeared to be a display of sabrerattling aimed at the new government in kiev the us reacted in a strongly worded message with the secretary of state john kerry saying that any military intervention in ukraine would be a grave mistake for a country that has spoken out so frequently against foreign intervention in libya in syria and elsewhere it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of ukraine kerry said last night putin had earlier instructed his defence minister sergei shoigu to place russias military in a state of high alert for drills in the western military district bordering ukraine the defence ministry denied the drills had anything to do with the political situation in kiev where the government of president viktor yanukovych was in effect toppled at the weekend but the move comes amid increasingly forthright statements from moscow that the rights of ethnic russians in ukraine are being infringed shoigu told a defence ministry meeting that forces must be ready to bomb unfamiliar testing grounds as part of the drill in his blunt message kerry also announced the obama administration was planning 1bn in loan guarantees and additional funding for ukraine but he said that us policy towards ukraine was not aimed at reducing russias influence this is not rocky iv kerry said it is not a zerosum game we do not view it through the lens of eastwest russiaus or anything else we view it as an example of people within a sovereign nation who are expressing their desire to choose their future and thats a very powerful force crimea has a largely prorussian population and earlier this week ukraines acting president oleksandr turchynov warned there was a serious risk of separatism in the region in the regional capital of simferopol on wednesday there was a gathering of around 10000 crimean tatars a muslim ethnic group that supports the peninsula remaining part of ukraine waving ukrainian flags they chanted ukraine is not russia the group clashed with a smaller prorussian rally nearby in which participants waved russian flags protesters shouted abuse at each other with the atmosphere growing more hostile by afternoon the prorussian group swelled to about 5000 later on as more protesters arrived on buses from the port city of sevastopol where the russian black sea fleet is based a smattering of rocks flew as the two sides engaged in fistfights at the frontline the anger in the faces of both sides was visible shortly before the violence as they catcalled and jeered at one another and beckoned at each other offering the occasional middlefinger salute youre defending all the millionaires who have stolen the land shouted one angry tatar the russians responded with a taunting rally cry of berkut berkut berkut a reference to the police special unit responsible for much of the violence against

ukraine to europe we just want to be free said arsen bilyalov a 36yearold tatar the clashes resulted in several serious injuries on the russian side as well as one death apparently from a heart attack the parliamentary session was cancelled as a result of the violence outside ukraines acting interior minister said he was doing all he could so as not to inflame tensions in crimea further the police and all enforcement bodies in crimea received instruction from me – at any cost do not provoke any conflict any military confrontation with the civilians arsen avakov said link to video ukraine must form inclusive government says william hague im demanding law enforcement officers from sevastopol to simferopol to do all possible to prevent clashes between radical prorussian forces with any other radicals including those who stand for european integration or crimean tatars he added avakov also announced on wednesday that the notorious berkut riot police elite troops responsible for much of the violence over the past three months had been disbanded this special unit has totally discredited itself he said adding that a new unit would be established in time the 4000 former berkut troops will now have to pass a revalidation exam in the next 15 days to determine whether they will serve in the new structure he added that some topranking berkut officers had fled already and police were searching for them however in another sign that crimea is the only part of ukraine where the new authorities are not welcome a number of berkut units returning to the region from kiev have received a heros welcome this week and on wednesday the newlyappointed prorussia mayor of sevastopol invited the elite squad to join local law enforcement since yanukovych fled the capital at the weekend the protest movement has moved to take over the mantle of government attempting to build bridges with the police and intelligence services and continuing to patrol the capital with its own selfdefence

former boxer vitali klitschko and yulia tymoshenko the former prime minister who was released from jail on saturday she has not yet said whether she will run tymoshenkos ally arseny yatsenyuk was

interim authorities said they believed he was hiding in crimea after a failed attempt to leave the country in a private jet from donetsk airport there were unconfirmed reports in ukrainian media that yanukovych had left crimea by sea and was now in russia with his two sons one russian news outlet claimed yanukovych had been spotted at a government sanitorium just outside moscow however a top russian foreign policy official told russian media on wednesday evening he was absolutely certain that yanukovych was not in russia mikhail margelov added that he thought it unlikely that russia would offer asylum to the disgraced leader although just a day earlier a top russian mp had said moscow still considered yanukovych to be the legitimate president of ukraine avakov said ukraines new authorities had pulled back from the search for yanukovych in crimea fearing that treading too heavily could destabilise the fragile situation further we decided the fate of crimea is more important

There, too, most of the inhabitants are Russian speaking with a strong affinity to Moscow – in contrast to their European-oriented compatriots in the capital, Kiev.\n\nThese military movements were accompanied by sharp Russian rhetoric in Moscow’s first direct response to the tumult in Kiev and ouster of the pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, against whom Kiev police Monday issued a warrant for mass murder.\n\nRussian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Monday: “Today I see no legitimate Ukrainian partners for a dialogue. If people crossing Kyiv in black masks and Kalashnikov rifles are considered a government, it will be difficult for us to work with such a government,” he said, calling it “the result of a mutiny.”\n\n The prime minister spoke of a “real threat to our interests, and to our citizens’ lives and health.”\n\nWith these comments, the Russian leader laid down a pretext for Russian military intervention in Ukraine. It was Moscow’s response to the warning issued by US National Security Adviser Susan Rice Sunday, Feb. 23, that “it would be a grave mistake for Russia to send military force.”\n\nAn area emerging as a potential flashpoint in the Ukraine crisis is the Crimean peninsula in the south.\n\nThis territory and its port of Sevastopol was part of Russian imperial might from the 18th century until in 1954 when Nikita Khrushchev, an ethnic Ukrainian, transferred it to Ukrainian control – a step bitterly resented by Russians ever since.\n\nWhen Ukraine broke away from the Soviet Union in 1991, it took Crimea with it. Moscow has since leased the strategically critical naval base as a deep-water port for the Russian Black Sea Fleet, with easy access to the Mediterranean. The lease is paid up to 2042. Ethnic Russians make up almost 60 per cent of the population, with Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars accounting for the rest. If Ukrainian turmoil continues and it faces a real threat of breaking up, Vladimir Putin may seize the opportunity to recover the peninsula. The Russian military force in Sebastopol was already beefed up Monday.",

            "text": "The Crimean parliament was taken over by armed men early Thursday morning.\n\nRussian flags are hoisted on top of the buildings, Interfax reported, adding that local sources told them that the men are part of a spontaneously \"self-defense\" unit formed by the region's Russian-speaking population . A flag reading \"Crimea Russia\" in Russian hangs on barricades outside the building's entrance.�\n\nFollowing the ousting of Kremlin ally and former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych from his post last Saturday, the predominantly pro-Russian Crimea has been divided between Russian separatists and ethnic Tatars who support the new Ukrainian government. In addition to ethnic ties, Russia also maintains a Black Sea naval base in the Crimean city of Sevastopol.\n\nThe invaders have not yet issued any demands since seizing the buildings around 4 a.m. Crimean Prime Minister Anatoly Mogilev reportedly tried to conduct negotiations with the unknown men, but was unsuccessful. \n\n\n\nMogilev said that the men do not want to enter into negotiations or explain the reasons for their actions, but that members of the Supreme Council of Crimea were being allowed into the building. An unidentified Crimean government official told Interfax Thursday afternoon that a meeting of the parliament at 2 p.m. local time would discuss greater autonomy for the region.\n\nThe scene outside the building turned to one of pro-Russia support in the mid-afternoon, as between 300 and 400 young people with Russian flags crossed police lines and began shouting \"Russia! Russia!\" ahead of a the planned parliamentary session, Interfax reported. The demonstrations follow larger actions by both pro- and anti-Russia groups in front of the parliament on Wednesday, which turned into violent clashes between the two groups. \n\n\n\nNo one was injured in the building takeover, Mogilev's press secretary said. The surrounding area has been sealed off by police, and a work holiday has been declared in the city.\n\n\"We were building barricades in the night to protect parliament. Then this young Russian guy came up with a pistol ... we all lay down, some more ran up, there was some shooting and around 50 went in through the window,\" ethnic Russian Leonid Khazanov told Reuters.\n\nActing Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said on his Facebook page that police had been put on high alert in response to the building seizure. He said \"provocateurs are on the march. Time for cool heads, consolidation of healthy forces and precise actions.\"\n\nObservers speculated about possible military movement midday Thursday after multiple media outlets have reported that there is a line of armored vehicles outside the city near a Russian military base in the Simferopol region.\n\nInterfax Ukraine reported that the tanks, which were headed in the direction of Simferopol, were conducting a training exercise and have since turned around.�\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has asked for immediate consultations with Moscow and summoned Russia's envoy in Kiev, Reuters reported. \n\n\n\nActing Ukrainian President Oleksander Turchynov had earlier in the day urged Russian military forces not to move outside of their base in Sevastopol and that doing so would be seen as an act of aggression.�\n\nThe Ukrainian Prosecutor General's office announced that it has opened an investigation into the building seizure as a terrorist act.�",

            "text": "The residents of Crimea, a region of southern Ukraine, woke up on Thursday to find their country’s flag over the regional parliament replaced with the Russian tricolor. Overnight, dozens of gunmen had seized the building, taking advantage of the power vacuum that has emerged in Ukraine since last week’s revolution ousted the ruling government. Though the gunmen did not immediately state their demands, local officials said they were from the pro-Russian majority on the Crimean peninsula, which has been up in arms against the nationalist, anti-Russian elements of the uprising that overthrew President Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nEyewitnesses and local officials said more than 100 armed men had carried bags of assault rifles, grenade launchers and other weapons into the parliament building before sealing themselves inside early Thursday morning. The gunmen told security guards to leave the building, and they have not taken any hostages. “The men who have taken the building are not showing any signs of aggression,” Crimean Prime Minister Anatoly Mogilev said in televised remarks on Thursday morning. “The situation is under control. The negotiations are underway.” The vice premier of the Crimea, Rustam Temirgaliev, said that the gunmen were “self-defense forces of the Russian-speaking citizens of Crimea.”\n\nSince revolutionaries took over Ukraine’s capital a week ago, the ethnic Russian majority in the Crimea has largely refused to recognize the new government. In some Crimean cities, citizens have begun forming pro-Russian militias to resist the new authorities. “There’s not a chance in hell we’re going to accept the rule of that fascist scum,” Sergei Bochenko, the commander of a local militia group in the Crimea, told TIME last week in the city of Sevastopol. He said his battalion was armed with assault rifles and had begun training to “defend our land.”\n\nResting on the southern tip of the Crimean peninsula, Sevastopol is home to a major Russian military base. Some of its ethnic Russian citizens have appealed for Moscow’s help to protect them from the new government, which they widely believe to be a fascist force backed by the United States and European Union.\n\nOn Thursday, as the siege unfolded in the Crimean capital, Russia received a similar appeal from Yanukovych, Ukraine’s ousted president, who is wanted in his homeland on charges of mass murder after police under his command slaughtered dozens of protesters last week. “As before, I consider myself the rightful head of the Ukrainian state,” he wrote in an appeal distributed to the press. “My allies and I have received threats of revenge, urging me to ask the authorities of the Russian Federation to ensure my personal safety from the actions of extremists,” he added, referring to the revolutionaries.\n\nSo far, Russia has refused all appeals to interfere in Ukraine. On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said during a trip to the E.U. that Russia had “confirmed our principled position of nonintervention in Ukraine’s internal affairs.” But a few days earlier, on Feb. 22, a senior delegation of Russian officials attended a summit of officials from the fallen regime and, in a resolution passed at the summit, called on Ukrainians to form militias to resist the revolutionary government.\n\n“The provocateurs are on the march,” Ukraine’s acting Interior Minister, Arsen Avakov, said in reaction to the seizure of the Crimean parliament. He said that police forces had been dispatched to the area to “prevent bloodshed among the civilian population.” But Ukraine’s police force is now in a state of upheaval. On Wednesday, Avakov disbanded country’s elite anti-riot troops, the force known as the Berkut, whose men gunned down dozens of protesters a week ago during the regime’s last stand against the revolution. The following day, the uprising forced the President and all of his police forces to flee.\n\nAs the revolutionaries took power, their so-called “self-defense forces” took over many functions of the police, while the forces of the old regime were sent back to their hometowns, jobless and afraid of retribution from the revolutionary government. Some of them have pledged to join militia groups and continue their fight against the revolutionaries. “Now this is a civil war,” said Vlad Roditelev, a 21-year-old policeman returning home to the Crimea on Saturday after his battalion was ordered to flee the capital. “We just have to defend our own city now,” he told TIME that day in his hometown of Sevastopol. “The country is lost.”",

The region is currently autonomous, meaning it has greater local control over its affairs.\n\nPolice officers, nominally under the control of the Ministry of Interior in Kiev, made little or no effort to control the crowds and, in some cases, even applauded their pro-Russia zeal. The police stood aside as the armed militants who seized government buildings overnight on Thursday built a barricade outside the regional legislature. The authorities ordered an emergency holiday, leaving streets mostly empty except for the protesters chanting for Russia, and many shops closed.\n\n“This is the first step toward civil war,” said Igor Baklanov, a computer expert who joined a group of anxious residents gathered in a cold drizzle at a thin police line near the Parliament building, a line that quickly vanished when activists of a nationalist group called Russian Movement of Ukraine marched up waving Russian flags. They were followed by columns organized by Russian Bloc, another pro-Moscow organization.\n\nThe rush of events in Crimea, which is home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, accelerated the forces tugging at Ukraine since the ouster last weekend of President Viktor F. Yanukovych. The events also deepened a dangerous rift between Ukraine’s new leadership and the Kremlin, which has refused to recognize the new government and now appears to have given shelter to the ousted president and added a new element of uncertainty to Russia’s relations with the West. Mr. Yanukovych, last sighted in Crimea over the weekend, appears to have since been spirited to Moscow via a Russian naval base in Sevastopol, the region’s biggest city, which last Friday forced its Kiev-appointed mayor to resign in favor of a Russian businessman.\n\nMany people in Crimea, even those who denounce the new leadership in Kiev as fascist, scorn the former president as a corrupt coward and say they have little desire to see him return. But the crowd outside Parliament in Simferopol cheered on Thursday as a protester with a bullhorn read out a statement released by Russian news agencies in which Mr. Yanukovych declared himself Ukraine’s only legitimate leader and said that Russian-speaking regions in eastern and southern Ukraine, including Crimea, would “not accept the anarchy and outright lawlessness” that has gripped the country.\n\nBy midafternoon, legislators — at least those who could get through the scrum of pro-Russia protesters outside, past barricades blocking the entrance and past unidentified armed insurgents inside — met to discuss holding a referendum on the future status of the volatile Black Sea peninsula. “Today we made a decision, a historic decision,” said Vladimir Konstantinov, the chairman of the legislature, who explained that a referendum would be held on May 25 to decide whether to “grant the autonomous republic the status of a state.”\n\nBut it was unclear what he meant exactly, and some local news reports said that the referendum would ask residents of Crimea only whether they wanted enhanced autonomy, not outright secession.\n\nAlso uncertain by late Thursday was whether enough of the assembly’s 100 members had shown up to give the legislative session the quorum needed to make its decisions legal. Refat Chubalov, a leader of the region’s minority Tatar population, a community of Turkic Muslims, said he had not been informed of the emergency session and denounced any decisions it made as invalid, noting that the building had been overrun by armed militants who hoisted the Russian flag and clearly favored a specific outcome.\n\nIf a referendum were held, it would almost certainly lead to an overwhelming popular vote in favor of weaker links with Ukraine and even outright secession.\n\nAll journalists were barred from attending the legislative session, but the Russian news media, which somehow obtained detailed information unavailable to even Crimean reporters, reported that legislators fired the head of the regional administration, a Kiev appointee, and replaced him with Sergei Aksyonov, the leader of a party called Russian Unity.\n\nOksana Korniychuk, a spokeswoman for the head of Parliament, was quoted as saying that Crimea was “under threat” because of the “unconstitutional seizure of power in Ukraine by radical nationalists supported by armed gangs.”\n\nThe mood of the crowd outside soared and slumped as often contradictory — and all unconfirmed — reports filtered out from the legislature. At one point, Oleg Sluzarenko, a former member of the assembly and now a leader of a hard-line Russian nationalist movement involved in Thursday’s protests, denounced legislators as scum, complaining that they were too concerned with protecting their own interests to make a decisive choice in favor of Russia. Shortly afterward, protesters started hailing the same legislators as heroes.\n\nThe authorities in Kiev would almost certainly dismiss any referendum as invalid. But a vote on Crimea’s status could be a gift for President Vladimir V.

Russian state news media, which is widely watched in Crimea, has pumped out the same line since Mr. Yanukovych fled.\n\nEarly Friday, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported that armed men in uniforms had arrived at the Simferopol airport in trucks and taken control. But the airport seemed to be operating normally.\n\nMr. Chubalov, the Tatar leader, condemned the pro-Russia takeover attempt as a dangerous spasm of retrograde impulses. He denounced what he termed “a direct interference in the affairs of Crimea and of Ukraine.”\n\nCrimea’s Tatar population, which was deported en masse from its homeland by Stalin, mostly wants the region to stay part of Ukraine, and although traditionally very peaceful, it has now started organizing self-defense units to fend off possible attacks by ethnic Russian militants.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what, if any, direct role Russia played in engineering the tumult, but the situation here matches in some ways a situation that previously played out in areas like Abkhazia and South Ossetia, where largely pro-Russia populations broke away from Georgia, a former Soviet republic like Ukraine, to effectively become Russian protectorates. Russian military vehicles, which had been far more visible on the streets than usual in previous days, stayed in their compounds on Thursday.\n\n“I am very happy to see the Russian flag flying there,” said Valentina Kartushina, a Simferopol resident who on Thursday morning stood among a throng of protesters screaming for union with Russia. Russia controlled Crimea for centuries but lost it to Ukraine in 1954 after what at the time seemed an inconsequential redrawing of internal Soviet boundaries by Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Communist Party leader.\n\nThe pace of developments, set largely by well-organized pro-Russia groups that marched through Simferopol in military-style formations, has perhaps outrun even Moscow’s capacity for geopolitical machinations. Having mobilized its air and ground forces around Ukraine on Wednesday for previously unannounced military exercises in Western Russia, Moscow has raised expectations among its most zealous supporters that it will intervene to support their cause.\n\nBut any open military intervention would risk plunging Crimea, a vital outpost for the Russian Navy, into bloody chaos and also undermine security inside Russia, particularly in heavily Muslim areas.\n\nCrimea’s Tatars have no record of extremism, but armed intervention by Moscow could strengthen the hand of tiny militant Islamic groups that have long tried, but failed, to rally Tatars for jihad.\n\nIn the late afternoon, around a thousand people, mostly young men dressed in black, broke away from the main protest in front of the regional Parliament and paraded down Karl Marx Street to a statue of Lenin in front of the headquarters of the regional government, which was seized by armed men overnight.\n\nCarrying a huge Russian flag, they then marched through other parts of the city screaming support for Russia and also for Berkut, the Ukrainian antiriot force that killed more than 80 protesters in violence last week in Kiev before Mr. Yanukovych’s flight.\n\n“Glory to Berkut,” they chanted in a deliberately incendiary retort to the favorite slogan of Ukrainian nationalists, “Glory to Ukraine.”",

            "text": "Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was placed on a “wanted” list today after Acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov opened a criminal investigation into last week’s killings of protesters in Kyiv’s Maidan Square.\n\n“As of this morning, a criminal case on mass killings of civilians has been opened. Yanukovych and several other officials have been placed on the wanted list,” Avakov announced on his Facebook page. Excerpts of Avakov’s statement have been translated into English by Interfax-Ukraine and Kyiv Post.\n\nThe whereabouts of Yanukovych are unknown.\n\nYanukovych left Kyiv on Friday shortly after signing an agreement with three opposition leaders calling for constitutional reforms and early presidential elections by December. He flew to Kharkiv, the country’s second largest city near the Russian border, where he was supposed to attend a Party of Regions congress.\n\nAfter the parliament – Verkhovna Rada – voted on Saturday to remove Yanukovych from office (citing his absence in Kyiv) and schedule elections for May 25th, Yanukovych adamantly stated that he will not resign and will remain in Ukraine in an interview with UBR-TV.\n\nYanukovych and his entourage then flew from Kharkiv to his hometown of Donetsk, where his chartered planes were blocked from leaving by border guards, according to Avakov. Yanukovych then traveled to Crimea, where he stayed a private facility. Yanukovych reportedly gave up state protection and left “in an unknown direction in three cars, turning off all communications devices” after he learned about “the parliament’s decision to appoint [Oleksandr] Turchynov [head of the Rada] as acting president of Ukraine.”\n\nWhat’s left of Yanukovych’s power was eroded even more when the Rada began building a new interim Cabinet over the weekend and appointed:\n\nToday, the parliament voted to dismiss five judges – Holovin Anatolii Serhilovych, Kolos Mykhailo Ivanovych, Markush Maria Andriivna, Ovcharenko Viacheslav Andrilovych, and Paseniuk Oleksandr Mykhailovych, of the Constitutional Court. The parliament also recommended removing seven other judges – Bryntsev Vasyl Dmytrovych, Hultai Mykhailo Myroslavovych, Zaporozhets Mykhailo Petrovych, Serheichuk Oleh Anatoliiovych, and Shaptala Natalia Konstiantynivna – from the bench pending reviews.\n\nRussia, clearly unhappy with the latest developments, withdrew its ambassador from Ukraine – an unprecedented move given the two countries’ close economic and political ties.\n\n“Our ambassador has been recalled for consultations. I think you understand without my explanations what this means in diplomatic practice,” Dimtry Medvedev, Russia’s Prime Minister, told Interfax. “It is not clear to us what is going on there and that there is a real threat to our interests and to our citizens’ lives and health.”\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry strongly criticized the recent actions of the Rada, describing them as “dictatorial”.\n\n“Russia is surprised that several European politicians hurried up to uphold early presidential elections in Ukraine scheduled for May although the agreement of February 21 says the elections should take part after the constitutional reform is over. It is clear that all political forces should take part in carrying out this reform. All regions should take part in the reform, and its results should be submitted to a referendum,” according to a statement issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry.\n\nNational Security Advisor Susan Rice emphasized yesterday that it would be a “grave mistake” if Russia decides to send forces into Ukraine to restore a pro-Russian government or to supporting splitting the country in half. The western part of Ukraine favors closer ties to Europe, and the eastern region favors Russia.\n\n“It’s not in the interests of Ukrainian or of Russia or of Europe or the United States to see the country split. It’s in nobody’s interest to see violence returned and the situation escalate,” said Rice during her appearance on NBC’s Meet The Press. “There is not an inherent contradiction…between a Ukraine that has longstanding historic and cultural ties to Russia and a modern Ukraine that wants to integrate more closely with Europe.”\n\nMass demonstrations have been held in Maidan Square since late November when Yanukovych suspended talks on the European Union-Ukraine Association Agreement. The protests turned deadly last week. At least 75 people were reportedly killed in clashes with police, many of them shot by snipers.",

            "text": "Russian Army on High Alert - Army Readiness Drills Started\n\nSIMFEROPOL, Ukraine — With cries of \"Allahu akbar,\" Arabic for \"God is great,\" thousands of protesters in the capital of Ukraine's Crimea region, a tinderbox of ethnic, religious and political divisions, added an Islamic voice on Wednesday to the tumultuous struggle for Ukraine that last weekend drove the president from power and that has pushed Russia and the West into a face-off reminiscent of the Cold War.\n\nEight hundred miles away, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was ordering a surprise military exercise of ground and air forces on Ukraine's doorstep on Wednesday, adding to the tensions with Europe and the United States and underscoring his intention to keep the country in Moscow's orbit.\n\nA woman and her child lighting candles Wednesday in memory of protesters killed in recent clashes with the police in Kiev.In Ukraine, Naming of Interim Government Gets Mixed ResponseFEB. 26, 2014\n\nCatherine Ashton, left, the European Union's foreign policy chief, met in Kiev on Tuesday with Yulia V. Tymoshenko, the former Ukrainian prime minister who was freed from prison.Tentatively, European Union Weighs Its Options on Support for a New UkraineFEB. 25, 2014\n\nTaken together, the two events illustrated the continuing challenges that the new government in Kiev faces in calming separatism at home and placating a frustrated Russian leader who sees Ukraine as a vital part of his strategy of rebuilding Russian influence along the lines not of the former Soviet Union but of the czars. While few analysts expected a Russian military intervention in Ukraine, most said Mr. Putin was likely to respond in some fashion to such a stinging geopolitical defeat.\n\nThe question was how, and on Wednesday he provided a first answer, when Russia's military put tens of thousands of troops in western Russia on alert at 2 p.m. for an exercise scheduled to last until March 3. The minister of defense, Sergei K. Shoigu, also announced unspecified measures to tighten security at the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet on the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nRussian military vehicles have been far more visible in recent days on the streets of Crimea, residents say, suggesting that Moscow, while probably not gearing up for armed conflict, wants to make its presence felt in this potentially volatile region, where it has a number of naval and other military facilities dating from the Soviet Union.\n\nIn a sign of heightened tension, road blocks flying Russian flags appeared Wednesday on the main thoroughfares leading to Sevastopol, a Crimean city dominated economically and politically by the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet. About 25 miles from the city center on the road from Simferopol, men in blue uniforms and others in green camouflage clothing stopped and inspected all vehicles. An armored personnel carrier, apparently Russian, was parked nearby.\n\nGeneral Shoigu announced the snap exercise during a meeting of Russia's general staff members, citing the need to test the Russian armed forces' readiness to respond to a \"crisis situation.\"\n\nSenior defense and government officials later said the exercise was not related to the events in Ukraine, which officials here have watched with growing alarm, but they also said there was no reason to postpone them either, and the geopolitical message was clear.\n\n\n\nThe orders came as thousands of ethnic Russians gathered outside the regional Parliament in Crimea's capital, Simferopol, to protest the political upheaval in Ukraine's capital, Kiev, that felled the government of President Viktor F. Yanukovych over the weekend and turned him into a fugitive. Crimea was Russian territory until the Soviet Union ceded it to the Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine in 1954, and Russians there have already pleaded for the Kremlin's intervention to protect the region from Ukraine's new leadership.\n\n\"Crimea is Russian!\" some of the protesters screamed as brawls erupted with rival demonstrations by Crimea's ethnic Tatars supporting the new interim authorities. Bravo Putin. Glad to see this show of power. The Russians in Crimea and sailors of the Black Sea Fleet need to be defended.\n\nDetermined to block the local legislature from heeding calls from pro-Russia activists for more autonomy and even secession from Ukraine, 5,000 Crimean Tatars, the region's indigenous Turkic, Muslim population, traded taunts and occasional blows with protesters waving Russian flags.\n\nAfter a peaceful start, the dueling rallies turned into a melee in the late afternoon. A couple of dozen Tatars broke into the legislative building, surging past riot police officers to confront anxious local legislators huddled inside.\"Where are the separatists?\" screamed a furious Tatar activist, banging a wooden staff on the marble floor.",

make up almost 60 per cent of the population with ukrainians and crimean tatars accounting for the rest if ukrainian turmoil continues and it faces a real threat of breaking up vladimir putin may seize the opportunity to recover the peninsula the russian military force in sebastopol was already beefed up monday israel as proof of gods existence proof of changed lives by dr david r reagan httpwwwlamblionus201401israelasproofofgodsexistenceproofhtml with regard to changed lives i have in mind the way in which lives have been radically changed throughout history when they came in contact with god and put their faith in him consider for example the lives of abraham and paul abraham was an idolater and paul was an accomplice to murder when their lives were totally transformed when they encountered god and placed their faith in him and the bible is full of many other examples an amazing last will and testament i encountered an example in september of 2012 when i received a letter from a law firm in chicago informing me that lamb lion ministries had been named as a beneficiary in a will a copy of the will was enclosed with the letter it began by stating that the testator had no living relatives he then specified that he wanted gifts of 30000 each to be given to three friends whom he named next he stated that he wanted 2500 to be spent on a party in his honor at a local bar with drinks on the house it was at that point that i began to wonder how in the world our ministry could possibly be one of his beneficiaries my puzzlement became even greater when i turned to the next page it contained a list of the groups who were to receive the remainder of his estate several catholic charities were mentioned followed by a long list of liberal organizations from the aclu to a harvard embryo research center at that point i was really perplexed at how we could possibly be named in such a last will and testament then i turned the page and there was a new will dated three years later it began the same way with gifts to the same three friends but from that point on the will was radically different for you see the next statement was a repudiation of the party at the bar just forget about it he wrote then came the listing of the beneficiaries there were only three two messianic ministries and our ministry i immediately realized that i was holding in my hands absolute evidence of the existence of god and his miracle working power it was obvious that during the three years between the two wills this man had met jesus and his life and values had been totally transformed jack hollingsworth that was not the first time i had seen such a radical impact of god on a life let me share with you another example i have in mind a man named jack hollingsworth who lived on the streets as a homeless alcoholic for 20 years in 1988 he wandered into a detox center in lexington kentucky where he was confronted by a tough little lady named sally when he started trying to con her she confronted him with his drunkenness and told him i declare to you in the name of jesus that you will never be able to get drunk again jack laughed and wrote her off as nuts after all he was a professional drunk and he could get drunk any time he desired but to his amazement he discovered that he could no longer even get a buzz on no matter how much he drank finally he went back and asked sally to tell him about jesus she did and jack put his faith in him as his lord and savior his life was totally transformed jack was instantly delivered from alcoholism he and sally later married and they formed a ministry called acts 29 and ever since 1993 they have been on the road together with jack teaching preaching and singing and in the process jack became the featured singer on our tv program what greater proof do you need that god exists but atheists renounce such proof out of hand by declaring it to be too subjective show me something objective and tangible they declare in the third segment of our study of how israel proves the existence of god well pause secondly to look at the proof of design by nature pope francis and the emerging one world religion by michael snyder httpthetruthwinscomarchivespopefrancisandtheemergingoneworldreligion is pope francis taking steps that are laying the groundwork for the emergence of a one world religion if that question sounds quite bizarre to you i urge you to read the rest of this article we live at a time when globalization is advancing rapidly the global economy is more integrated than it has ever been before and with each passing year new economic treaties tie us even more closely together and global governance as the elite like to call it is also steadily gaining ground through a whole host of global institutions such as the united nations the world bank the imf and the bank for international settlements global governments are working together to a degree that is unprecedented well what about religion is there evidence that we are also witnessing the globalization of religion well yes there is in fact it appears that pope francis intends to lead the way since he has been pope francis has expressed a desire for unity with the eastern orthodox the anglicans and many other major protestant denominations but more than a few eyebrows were raised when he recently sent a video message to kenneth copeland and his congregation at the time that the video message was played to the congregation one speaker declared that luthers protest is over the catholic and charismatic renewal is the hope of the church exclaims anglican episcopal bishop tony palmer before a group of cheering followers at the kenneth copeland ministries palmer said those words are from the vatican before playing the video message from pope francis to kenneth copeland palmer told the crowd when my wife saw that she could be catholic and charismatic and evangelical and pentecostal and it was absolutely accepted in the catholic church she said that she would like to reconnect her roots with the catholic culture so she did the crowd cheered as he continued brothers and sisters luthers protest is over is yours even kenneth copeland finds this development incredible said copeland heaven is thrilled over thisyou know what is so thrilling to me when we went into the ministry 47 years ago this was impossible you can see video from this conference right here so is luthers protest really over during the council of trent the catholics condemned to hell anyone that believes in salvation through faith in jesus alone this is a direct quote from the council of trent if any one saith that by faith alone the impious is justified in such wise as to mean that nothing else is required to cooperate in order to the obtaining the grace of justification and that it is not in any way necessary that he be prepared and disposed by the movement of his own will let him be anathema the catholics have never renounced that stand instead it has been reaffirmed many times over the years if pope francis really did want to reach out to protestants he should start by reversing the council of trent on this as it stands it is official catholic doctrine that all protestants are anathema but apparently that is not going to stop many protestants from reuniting with rome and declaring francis to be their pope meanwhile pope francis has also been aggressively courting muslims the following quote from pope francis comes from remarks that he made during his very first ecumenical meeting i then greet and cordially thank you all dear friends belonging to other religious traditions first of all the muslims who worship the one god living and merciful and call upon him in prayer and all of you i really appreciate your presence in it i see a tangible sign of the will to grow in mutual esteem and cooperation for the common good of humanity the catholic church is aware of the importance of promoting friendship and respect between men and women of different religious traditions i wish to repeat this promoting friendship and respect between men and women of different religious traditions it also attests the valuable work that the pontifical council for interreligious dialogue performs did you catch that apparently pope francis believes that catholics and muslims worship the same god more recently francis made the following statement about muslims we must never forget that they profess to hold the faith of abraham and together with us they adore the one merciful god who will judge humanity on the last day wow by making this statement pope francis is rejecting another of the most fundamental doctrines of the christian faith you see christians believe that jesus christ is god muslims hate this doctrine and say that there is no god but allah so how in the world can christians and muslims worship the same god the only way that you could say this is if you deny the deity of jesus christ for much more on why allah and the god of christianity are not the same please see this article of course when it comes to other religions francis is not just reaching out to the muslims during the same ecumenical meeting that i referenced above he made it a point to say that he feels close to those that belong to any religious tradition in this we feel close even to all those men and women who whilst not recognizing themselves belonging to any religious tradition feel themselves nevertheless to be in search of truth goodness and beauty this truth goodness and beauty of god and who are our precious allies in efforts to defend the dignity of man in building a peaceful coexistence among peoples and in guarding creation carefully and francis really raised some eyebrows when he made the following statement about atheists the lord created us in his image and likeness and we are the image of the lord and he does good and all of us have this commandment at heart do good and do not do evil all of us but father this is not catholic he can not do good yes he can the lord has redeemed all of us all of us with the blood of christ all of us not just catholics everyone father the atheists even the atheists everyone we must meet one another doing good but i dont believe father i am an atheist but do good we will meet one another there there was a lot of debate about what francis meant by that and the vatican issued a statement declaring that catholic doctrine on these matters had not changed but without a doubt a lot of people were troubled by this in addition a lot of people were really troubled when the vatican offered indulgences to those that would follow pope francis on twitter the following is an excerpt from an article that appeared in the telegraph salvation or at least a shorter stay in purgatory might now be only a tweet away with news that pope francis is to offer indulgences remissions for temporary punishment to the faithful who follow him on the social media site around 15 million are expected to flock to rio de janeiro to celebrate world youth day with the argentine pontiff later this month but for those who cant make it to brazil forgiveness may be available to contrite sinners who follow franciss progress via their tv screen or social networks the sacred apostolic penitentiary the vatican court that rules on the forgiveness of sins has said that indulgences may be given to those who follow the rites and pious exercises of the event on television radio and through social media so what does pope francis actually believe that is a very good question his beliefs do not appear to be very consistent at all he just seems to have an overwhelming desire to unite with everyone out there that has any kind of religious faith but we do know one kind of people that he does not like he does not like ideological christians that take their faith very seriously in ideologies there is not jesus in his tenderness his love his meekness and ideologies are rigid always of every sign rigid and when a christian becomes a disciple of the ideology he has lost the faith he is no longer a disciple of jesus he is a disciple of this attitude of thought for this reason jesus said to them you have taken away the key of knowledge the knowledge of jesus is transformed into an ideological and also moralistic knowledge because these close the door with many requirements the faith becomes ideology and ideology frightens ideology chases away the people distances distances the people and distances of the church of the people but it is a serious illness this of ideological christians it is an illness but it is not new eh so what is going to come of all this it will be very interesting to watch it is also interesting to note that there is a 900yearold prophecy that seems to indicate that pope francis could be the last pope if that prophecy is accurate then we could very well be living at a time when we will see the emergence of a one world religion just a few short decades ago a one world religion would have been absolutely unthinkable but now the pieces are starting to come together and it will be very interesting to see what happens next the book of daniel dvd series i am very pleased to announce that the first dvd in the book of daniel dvd series is nearly complete the first dvd in the series includes an introduction to the book of daniel and also covers chapters 1 2 there will be 5 more dvds for a total of 6 for the series each covering 2 chapters almost everyone looks at the book of daniel with a sense of wonder and anticipation because this is usually regarded as a prophetic book foretelling the future this is true the book of daniel together with the book of revelation marvelously unfolds future events as god has ordained them in the program of history by no means has this book yet been fulfilled neither has the book of revelation these two books one from the old and one from the new testament remarkably complement each other in their symmetry and harmony the book of revelation explains the book of daniel the book of daniel lays the basis for the book of revelation if you would like to know gods program for the future it is essential that you understand this book of daniel the genre of the book of daniel is narrative history prophetic oracle and it includes apocalyptic material the prophet daniel wrote it around 530 bc and his writings records the events of the babylonian captivity in 560536 bc to which daniel was a servant it also describes the apocalyptic visions given by god and reveals the events and plans for everyones future key personalities of this book include daniel nebuchadnezzar shadrach meshach abednego belshazzar and darius the purpose of this book is to provide a historical account how the lord god protected and provided for his faithful followers while in captivity it also includes a vision of future redemption and hope in chapters 16 daniel writes about his own life in captivity he was selected to work for the babylonian king nebuchadnezzar daniel or his babylonian name belteshazzar and his friends made bold and tough decisions and several times displayed their integrity to stand for godliness instead of culture they rejecting the kings food prayed when it was illegal to do so and refused to bow to the kings idol for which they were thrown into a scorching furnace daniel interpreted the kings dreams twice then was promoted as chief over all the wise men in babylon yet through all the great things that daniel did he claimed it was god that did it through him and he gave all the glory to god it is he who reveals the profound and hidden things he knows what is in the darkness and the light dwells with him 222 chapters 712 contain the visions that daniel received from god and the events that are involved in his prophetic ministry a portion of these includes the results of the earthly kingdoms that he lived in they also mention the coming messiah and the apocalyptic events to come as for me i heard but could not understand so i said my lord what will be the outcome of these events he said go your way daniel for these

httpwwwrapturereadycomsoapcameron42html carl sat at the doorway searching for those in need his hands trembling cold as an arctic blast cut through the late night air hurry in please hurry in he said more and more people hurried along some nearly crushing carl as they pushed into the building in desperation to feel the heat inside more blankets honey carl cried out more blankets theres hot soup yall so please eat up as the last one made his way into the homeless shelter carl closed the door tight up in years and overworked for little or no pay carl surveyed the expansive room over at the end of one table sat a family of four the mom hunkered near her youngest rubbing her daughters hands she smiled to cover the shame and pain carl looked around carefully so dearly wanting to make everything all right for everyone unaware that he was sharing his heavenly fathers heart to love and console others he hurried over to the woman and child bringing warm blankets handed to him by his devoted wife edna here here you are carl said please get warm the mothers eyes looked up she embraced the warmth of not only the blankets but the godly man hot soup warm blankets and a night away from the bitter cold something so many take for granted all across this world as soon as everyone in the room had been served their bowls of soup carl asked permission to say a word and then pray he began tonight you are all here by invitation these doors are always open and all you have to do is walk in please take a moment and look around this has been a banquet dinner and i call you allfriends but this is nothing compared to what you will be offered there is even now a banquet table being prepared your invitation i have right here in my hand carl opened his bible and began to read john 316 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believes upon him shall not perish but have everlasting life closing the bible he slowly gazed at the sorrowfilled eyes all around the room i beg you all to hear me i hope i dont start to cry do you want to know when your invitation was sent out the day jesus died while you were yet lost in sin lost in a cold cruel world jesus died for you but three days later he rose from that grave when he did doors flew open and a meal started to be prepared its called the marriage supper of the lamb please dont be overlooked tonight sitting here in this humble banquet hall please hear this old man please let jesus write your name in his accepted book the book of life in deepest humility carl called everyone in the room to the cross asking them to pray carl observed the forlorn faces in the crowded room respectfully bowing their heads the group together prayed following carls lead outside that same evening little maria sat beside her mother mommy im so cold shivering to the core the youngest of two children clung to her mothers leg trying to hide her face from the wind the mother observed at the desperate look in her husband jimmys eyes beaten down and hopelesstrying to withstand the bitter chill of the strong winds bankruptcy foreclosure and medical bills to the max found their way onto this dads shoulders and on this night its total weight had come crashing down they were homeless helpless in desperation he cried out dear god if youre up there please help leaning against a heavy concrete wall their young son brandon bowed his head in despair oh god why cant we be like everyone else and have our own place jimmy picked up his son with both arms and walked toward the shelter his wife followed behind their daughter tightly wrapped in her arms trash from the street was blowing all around them the howling wind sent an eerie message of abandon up ahead they saw a door with a sign that said welcome shelter jimmy began to knock on the door as if his very life depended on it his familys heads were all hanging in shame at lifes most hopeless moment the door flew open and carl began to urgently usher in the weathertorn family hurry in please hurry in he said hello my names carl as he shut the door for the night he called out to his wife honey more blankets please then turning to the family he said wow you came just in time we were ready to shut this place down for the night please have a warm blanket soups on the stove and youre sure welcome to eat the family of four huddled up by an old table it was a treat already to just have a table to sit at and a warm room to escape to wind chills outside were below zero this family was happy to see clean cots all around and steaming hot soup served to warm their hungry stomachs why jimmy wonderedwould anyone do this for so many strangers then as they were eating friendly old carl began to speaksharing the gospel again you are all here by invitationbut let me tell you of a future feast the night was cold and chilly but when carl finished his plea the entire family heard and answered that altar call almost immediately afterthe shout came come up here they had been made ready footnote this is the eighth in my series of short stories preludes to the rapture collection please feel free to download the stories as formatted and use them as witnessing material tim cameron timcameroncenturytelnet nearing midnight revelation 13 economy in view terry james httpwwwrapturereadycomrap16html i wrote in this column several weeks back about nefarious movement afoot by those of the selfanointed political ruling class we looked at how they are doing all within their power to keep the change that they have wrought over the last five years proceeding with as little resistance as possible the article pointed out that the change promised was indeed successful to this point and destructive to the nation it is plainly an allout assault to as written in that article attempt to bring america into a socialistic model that has strapped working citizens their children grandchildren and beyond with trillions of dollars of debt that can never be repaid many believe this has been done deliberately in order to bring the united states into configuration like and compliance with the new world order the worlds elite financiers and governmental leaders want to construct my essay went on to state that these elitist central planners i believe sense their momentum in continuing to change america fundamentally slipping away because of growing unpopularity among the voting public with the national healthcare system powergrab debacle that and other things such as a callous disregard for the rule of law and the us constitution i wrote further that those elitists are increasingly worried that people such as edward snowden the defected nsa consultantwhistle blower and other rabblerousers in the elitists view are causing slippage of power from the globalists these troublemakers arein one elitists own wordsencouraging individuals to become selfempowered eviscerating state control the same writer harlan k ullman indicated that a monumental crisis of some sort is needed to stop this slippage of power such a crisis i infer ullman is saying will create the slavish call by we underlings begging the national and international powersthatbe to continue having their way with us in controlling every aspect of our lives from cradle to grave my conclusion was and is that the crisis the internationalists the globalists are wanting will happen at the time when the rapture takes place people will indeed be looking for that savior to rescue them he will come riding in on that white horse of revelation 62 we are witnessing signals of that coming tribulation period upon the nearfuture horizon the geopolitical landscape is electric with such signals as we have covered many times in this column and through news reports and literally thousands of articles the socioeconomic prophetic landscape is no less alive with signals of things to come a bit of information this week pinpoints the preparation that is surely being made for paving antichrists way to control the tribulation worlds economy as various taxfunded international institutions explicitly outline plans to plunder humanitys wealth to prop up governments drowning in odious debts the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd last week officially unveiled a new socialistbacked plot to create a global tax informationsharing regime to ensure that nobody except the establishment escapes the upcoming fleecing under the proposed scheme admittedly inspired by fatca the obama administrations latest addition to the sprawling us tax regime governments and dictatorships worldwide will automatically share all private financial data on citizens with each other to extract as much wealth as possible from the public calling its scheme to put the final nail in the coffin for financial privacy game changing the taxfunded oecd said it would require governments to collect massive amounts of sensitive personal information on individuals from banks and other financial institutions in their jurisdictions once gathered the vast troves of private data would be automatically exchanged between all participating governments and dictatorships we call on other countries and jurisdictions to commit to join this initiative at the earliest opportunity with the aim of rapidly creating a truly global system of automatic information exchange the governments continued in their joint statement osnetdaily globalists unveil new world tax regime alex newman feb 18 2014 plans are well underway for that moment of great crisis for which the globalistselite are no doubt praying the true believer in jesus christ has no need to worry about that coming draconian system of absolute control over buying and selling we are instructed by jesus lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also matthew 61921 public wins stopping tyranny give way to more tyranny bill wilson wwwdailyjotcom a week after reports that the dhs planned a national license plate recognition program dhs decided on february 19 that it would not implement the program a few days after america found out about the federal communications commission plan to sit in news rooms and ask questions about news gathering newsroom politics and other intimidations the fcc said it was suspending the program the occupant of the oval office has said that his administration would stop the irs singling out conservative groups for audits and intimidation all these are examples of soft tyranny because none of them in the end will be stoppedin fact they are moving ahead despite assurances to the contrary engagetcom reports dhs decided it doesnt need a national database of everyones license plates individual law enforcement units across the country already use license plate readers to track vehicles and dhs wanted to connect them together to create a new national license plate recognition database fox news reported that the program was stopped because the notice of it was posted without the awareness of ice immigration and customs enforcement leadership but heres the real deal dhs only postponed the program until the original proposal is reviewed by ice this means that after the public heat dies down dhs will go forward with the program the washington examiner reports that the fcc was working with uscs annenberg school for communication and journalism and the university of wisconsinmadison center for communication and democracy in developing criteria for what information is critical for americans to have leftist billionaire george soros socialist open society foundations has funded these schools to the tune of more than 18 million since 2000 these schools have even more ties to soros including faculty members writing for universitybased publications allied with sorosfunded outlets meanwhile the fcc plans to go ahead with the newsroom program without the controversial questions regarding journalistic practices uhhuh the examiner reported february 13 that senate democratic leadership openly called for more irs targeting of conservative groups hoping to quell criticism of their voting records ahead of the election the examiner had released a previous study saying 100 percent of established 501c4 groups audited by the irs leaned to the right and individuals who criticize sic the president are increasingly finding themselves targeted by the irs to sum upall recent pledges to stop cracking down on your rights are temporary with plans to move rapidly forward jeremiah 614 says they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace how does soft tyranny impact your life going his way greg laurie wwwharvestorg can two people walk together without agreeing on the direction amos 33 i have a german shepherd that was a former guide dog for the blind because he had slight hip dysplasia he was put up for adoption when we got him he was perfectly trained we could take him anywhere he was happy to sit next to us another dog would walk by and he couldnt care less then i got a hold of him i would unleash him and let him run around in the park day by day he started getting worse the next thing you know he was lunging at dogs and taking off after cats and rabbits and squirrels i called the people we got him from and asked what went wrong they told me i couldnt let him do all that dog stuff i couldnt let him stop and sniff where he wanted to sniff i couldnt let him chase rabbits they gave me a little muzzle like device to put on him gaining control of his muzzle meant he would obey because it would hurt to pull away when i took the device off him he was in sync with me again we can be like that with god sometimes we are running around and being crazy doing what we want to do so the lord has to pull us back into line because he wants us to walk with him to walk with god means that i must get into harmony with him i must go the direction that god wants me to go how about you are you walking with god today or are you pulling against him trying to do things your own way if so

grayworxxgmailcom when this writer was at boarding school we would play a certain trick on an unsuspecting student the victim would be placed on a sturdy board and blindfolded four of us would then bend down and lift him a few inches from the floor in lifting him we would make a show of the effort involved with appropriate grunts and groans this was to convince the victim that he was being hoisted high up towards the ceiling the subsequent chatter assured the unsuspecting student that we had him standing on our shoulders when in fact he was mere inches from the ground then by bumping a piece of ceiling board on his head he was convinced that he was as high as the ceiling and in a precarious place then at the right moment one of us would pretend to buckle from the weight causing a collapse the effect of the resulting fall on the student was to say the least entertaining the deception convinced him that he was falling from ceiling height when in reality he was only inches from the floor the panic and sheer terror experienced by the student was a result of his belief he believed himself to be where he was not he did not reckon himself to be so close to safety his piercing scream and unbridled terror were all unnecessary he suffered massive stress simply because he was deceived and lied to about his true position are you too deceived as to who you are in christ and what your position in the family of god is romans 154 tells us for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope but not all scripture is written to you directly it is there for you to learn from and not apply to yourself as though it were written directly to you many of us have erroneous knowledge that does not work positively in our lives for example if you ask most people what is the one thing they know about the ostrich they will tell you that it sticks it head into the sand to avoid adversity this is a falsehood the ostrich does not stick its head into the sand the reason for this myth is probably because credible people repeated the story with conviction even africans who live on the same continent as the ostrich use this false analogy we all have a reservoir of untrue preprogrammed beliefs and assumptions that strongly influence our choices and decisions the question is can we unlearn all the error we have accumulated over time i recall as a very young man going to sunday school at the local anglican church in time i was old enough to be confirmed as a member of the anglican church it was not something i wanted to do so i resisted the whole idea my mother in an effort to encourage me to comply told me that when i got older and wanted to get a job i would need to be confirmed before anyone would consider hiring me i complied reluctantly and got to kiss the bishops ring the point of this story is that for many years afterward i really believed that i would get work when i grew up because i was confirmed in the anglican church defibrillation most people have probably all seen a scene in a movie where the paramedic or doctor bares the chest of a patient and rubs together the two ends of disclike paddles and shouts clear he then administers the paddles to the bare chest of the patient who convulses violently bouncing up and falling back in an undignified and somewhat comical manner if the patient does not respond the intensity of the machine is cranked up and reapplied resulting in even greater convulsions this machine is called a defibrillator do you need a spiritual defibrillation in order for you to get back on track have you become so remote from your first love that it would take something drastic to shock you back to reality how many of us need some drastic outer influence to bring our hearts back to life especially in this day and at this hour are you excited for the soon return of jesus are you enthusiastic about the word of god to digress slightly it is interesting and worth mentioning here that the english word enthusiasm is translated from two greek words en and theos en means to be in theos means god enthusiasm then really means to have god inside the result of this state of being is the production of an ardent and lively interest or eagerness folks it really is later than you think get enthusiastic this is a call to you whom the holy spirit is speaking to is it going to take a dramatic shock or a gentle massaging to bring your heart back from this worlds charms and its entanglements if the divine physician looks at you will he find a pulse beating inside are you expressing your true life from within is there a humble heart beating with excitement and anticipation for the things of god i would implore you to petition god to do a work in your life that will cause your heart to respond to the christ within let his life be your life living through you as you this does not make you christ but it makes you christlike it will not make you sinless but you will sin less you will be fulfilled by living exactly as god intended you to by christ living through you as you are dont wait for some dramatic shocking experience to jolt you to your senses respond to the holy spirit today and become what you already are in christ a child of god and one who lives and moves and has his being in christ the lord id near memory stick religion if youll allow me i would like to make an analogy involving the computer it is as if jesus is installed in the hard drive of your being jesus is not on an external storage devise like a usb flash drive memory stick sd card or disc to be stored in a drawer somewhere and hauled out only when necessary too many christians think that they can keep christ on an external drive somehow and when things go wrong they then load him up and interact with him they seem ignorant of the fact that he is there with them in person wherever they are their union with christ is their spirit and his spirit joining together becoming a new creation when you got born again jesus christ was uploaded as part of your software your hardware the flesh does not respond well to the new programming within you it either rebels or it gets religious the flesh can be religious in the sense that it fakes piety and goodness in order not to be exposed as a fraud by the truth you do not have another life aside from the life that is in you and that is christ when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory colossians 3 4 we need to bolt this truth permanently into our thinking process you have no life aside from christ in you what about the sins we commit on a daily basis the real you is not the hard drive it is the software but because we live in the lousy here and now god in his great mercy and love for us has given us the christian bar of soap that bar of soap is 1 john 1 9 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness we are to watch and wait philippians 320 21 for our citizenship is in heaven from which we also eagerly wait for the savior the lord jesus christ who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to his glorious body according to the working by which he is able even to subdue all things to himself 1corinthians 17 so that you come short in no gift eagerly waiting for the revelation of our lord jesus christ 1thessalonians 110 and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come titus 213 looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great god and savior jesus christ hebrews 928 so christ was offered once to bear the sins of many to those who eagerly wait for him he will appear a second time apart from sin for salvation james 57 therefore be patient brethren until the coming of the lord see how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain mark 1336 37 lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping and what i say to you i say to all watch there is something else to consider in our occupying till the lord comes noah knew 7 days before that the flood was going to happen lot knew that sodom and gomorrah was about to be destroyed elijah knew that he was about to be taken up to god god does things in patterns and it is not inconceivable that we too might know when the rapture is about to happen seven days before seems like a good guess in lukes gospel jesus wept over the coming destruction of jerusalem because they did not see him as their messiah the coming of messiah was accurately predicted by the prophet daniel to the degree that he even predicted the very day of his arrival on the day prophesied by daniel they spread their clothes in his path and waved palm branches as he went by rejoicing and celebration was the order of the day but they missed the point of it all they missed their christ the long awaited messiah deeply distressed by their ignorance jesus said you did not know the time of your visitation luke 19 4144 the lord held israel accountable for unbelief will we too be held accountable for unbelief about the lords return could it be that the lord is visiting your heart right now could it be that this is the time of your visitation from god god expected the jews to know that their messiah was coming he expects us to know the season of his return too because he said that we would not be ignorant concerning the rapture the berean vs feather theology much of the church today are not bereans they have a taste for feather theology which tickles the ears they are not too concerned about what the scriptures say but rather how it makes them feel if one does not read and study the bible you open yourself up to error and heresy because you can not discern what truth is and what fantasy is many there are that are on the broad road that leads to destruction thinking that all is well because the pastor said so i am not saying that you need some special education to understand the bible quite the contrary everyone capable of reading can read for themselves what the word of god says the holy spirit will reveal gods word to you about jesus christ if you are simply willing to spend time and effort reading his word if you are with a group where you need someone to interpret the scriptures for you you are in a cult the bible is shallow enough for the most immature christian to get the milk he or she needs to be fed but the bible is deep enough to dive into depths that will bless us and sustain us for eternity sure there are difficulties from time to time in the bible but they are there by design in order for you to seek out the answers by being a berean it is always difficult when trying to encourage brothers and sisters to read the bible for themselves and not to rely on tv evangelists or dubious books of which there are many recently someone gave me this adviceit is better to be known for what you are for than what you are against having pondered on this matter i think that as christians we are all for certain things things like the bible righteousness purity goodness holiness etc but being for these things automatically puts you at variance with those who do not hold the same values as you do if you are for the truth of the word of god you are by definition against those who teach error there is no getting away from the fact that if you make a stand for the truth there will be enmity with error no matter the source of that error there is no sitting on the fence or compromise when it comes to the truth if you sit on the fence you are a prime target from both sides the enemies you make by taking a decided stand for truth generally have more respect for you than the friends you make by sitting on the fence my concern is not whether god is on our side my greatest concern is to be on gods side for god is always right abraham lincoln agree to disagree without being disagreeable using this wonderful site i have recently gone public with my beliefs regarding the rapture the response has been heartwarming to know that there are so many fellow travelers out there who long for the sound of the trumpet as their lord and saviour calls them home not surprisingly i received many nasty emails in response to the articles submitted for scrutiny this is of itself not problematic people take offence it is par for the course hate mail is acceptable even understandable when it comes to reprobates misbelievers and the lost souls whose only taste of success is the bite they take out of you there are those who disagree with the doctrine of the rapture the doctrine of the rapture does not save you from your sin so in some ways it is a peripheral matter but dear brother or sister do not take offence because someone else does believe the doctrine of the rapture i personally disagree with many respectable scholars but i have never had a rabid urge to make contact with them in order to insult them and make a judgment upon their lives that is not mine to make him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for god hath received him who art thou that judgest another mans servant to his own master he standeth or falleth yea he shall be holden up for god is able to make him stand romans 141 4 as a christian i personally have way too much to be thankful for because i am a forgiven sinner i am not sinless but as i express christ in me i sin less the scripture says brethren if a man is overtaken in any trespass you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness considering yourself lest you also be tempted galatians 61 disagreeing on peripheral issues is not all bad because it prompts us to study and check out things for ourselves the bushman the baboon and the bush here in africa the bushmen have a clever method for catching baboons in a trap they take a pumpkin or melon and cut into it a small hole just enough for a baboons hand to fit in tightly from this hole they scoop out some of the contents and replace it with the baboons favorite food then they hide nearby and simply wait if you have ever observed baboons you can not help but come to the conclusion that god certainly has a sense of humor they are truly comical creatures because they portray so many funny humanlike qualities the baboon approaches the juicy pumpkin and inspects it cautiously it sees the contents inside and reaches in to take hold of the food here is where things go wrong for the baboon once the baboon has clenched a fist on the bait he will not open his hand to let go the result is that he now has a heavy pumpkin attached to the end of his arm still he will not let go under different conditions and given some time and thought the baboon will figure out that he must open his fist in order to get free of the pumpkin it is precisely at this moment that the concealed bushman appears making much noise and spreading pandemonium the baboons mind is flooded with panic and he simply can not think logically which keeps him clutching onto the bait that now ensnares him without too much trouble the bushman rushes up to the hapless baboon and clubs it to death barbequed baboon is on the menu tonight in the bushman camp and so it is with us if we take offence if you are easily offended you run the risk of being beaten up by the enemy finally in order to be prepared for that great event called the rapture we all need to look at our lives if there is any sin that holds us back we must reject it and repent of it today not next week but today make the decision that you will prepare yourself as a bride for her bridegroom there are two components to our relationship with the lord the first is called union union is that unbreakable bond that was created when you first believed and the holy spirit came to dwell within you ephesians 11314 nothing you do can reverse that you can not become unborn union is the basis of our relationship with the father the second component is fellowship its the status of our relationship at any point in time characterized by twoway communication between ourselves and god through the holy spirit true all our sins were taken away at the cross colossians 21314 however we have not yet been cured of our sin nature that will come after the rapture when we are glorified if it were not so john wouldnt have counseled us to keep on praying for forgiveness when we do stumble and miss the mark set by god god fixed it so that our ongoing tendency to sin wouldnt disqualify us for salvation were being made holy because unholy beings can not dwell in the presence of a holy god we will one day soon be changed and made fit to dwell with him in his kingdom forever but that hasnt happened yet so to remain in fellowship now we have to clean up on a daily basis by seeking forgiveness for the sins we continue to commit the benefit of staying in fellowship with him is the incredible blessing and favour we receive from his hand as he fulfills the role of good shepherd described in psalm 23 to be out of fellowship with the lord because of sin means losing out on daytoday intimacy with him sin in this instance is the sin you indulge in as a lifestyle get clean today so union describes our eternal state while fellowship refers to our relationship in the here and now the reason so many christians live defeated lives is due to their failure to understand this difference they come forward to receive the lord and solve their eternal problem union but miss out on the tremendous blessing he can provide in the here and now fellowship by failing to confess and repent when they continue to sin

Russian military movements were also sighted near Belgorod, a Russian town 40 kilometers from the Ukraine border and north of its second largest town of Kharkov. There, too, most of the inhabitants are Russian speaking with a strong affinity to Moscow - in contrast to their European-oriented compatriots in the capital, Kiev. These military movements were accompanied by sharp Russian rhetoric in Moscow's first direct response to the tumult in Kiev and ouster of the pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, against whom Kiev police Monday issued a warrant for mass murder.  Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Monday: \"Today I see no legitimate Ukrainian partners for a dialogue. If people crossing Kyiv in black masks and Kalashnikov rifles are considered a government, it will be difficult for us to work with such a government,\" he said, calling it \"the result of a mutiny.\" The prime minister spoke of a \"real threat to our interests, and to our citizens' lives and health.\" With these comments, the Russian leader laid down a pretext for Russian military intervention in Ukraine. It was Moscow's response to the warning issued by US National Security Adviser Susan Rice Sunday, Feb. 23, that \"it would be a grave mistake for Russia to send military force.\" An area emerging as a potential flashpoint in the Ukraine crisis is the Crimean peninsula in the south. This territory and its port of Sevastopol was part of Russian imperial might from the 18th century until in 1954 when Nikita Khrushchev, an ethnic Ukrainian, transferred it to Ukrainian control - a step bitterly resented by Russians ever since. When Ukraine broke away from the Soviet Union in 1991, it took Crimea with it. Moscow has since leased the strategically critical naval base as a deep-water port for the Russian Black Sea Fleet, with easy access to the Mediterranean. The lease is paid up to 2042. Ethnic Russians make up almost 60 per cent of the population, with Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars accounting for the rest. If Ukrainian turmoil continues and it faces a real threat of breaking up, Vladimir Putin may seize the opportunity to recover the peninsula. The Russian military force in Sebastopol was already beefed up Monday. Israel as Proof of God's Existence: Proof of Changed Lives - By Dr. David R. Reagan - http://www.lamblion.us/2014/01/israel-as-proof-of-gods-existence-proof.html With regard to changed lives, I have in mind the way in which lives have been radically changed throughout history when they came in contact with God and put their faith in Him. Consider, for example the lives of Abraham and Paul. Abraham was an idolater and Paul was an accomplice to murder when their lives were totally transformed when they encountered God and placed their faith in Him. And the Bible is full of many other examples. An Amazing Last Will and Testament I encountered an example in September of 2012 when I received a letter from a law firm in Chicago informing me that Lamb & Lion Ministries had been named as a beneficiary in a will. A copy of the will was enclosed with the letter. It began by stating that the testator had no living relatives. He then specified that he wanted gifts of $30,000 each to be given to three friends whom he named. Next, he stated that he wanted $2,500 to be spent on a party in his honor at a local bar, with drinks on the house! It was at that point that I began to wonder how in the world our ministry could possibly be one of his beneficiaries! My puzzlement became even greater when I turned to the next page. It contained a list of the groups who were to receive the remainder of his estate. Several Catholic charities were mentioned, followed by a long list of liberal organizations, from the ACLU to a Harvard Embryo Research Center. At that point, I was really perplexed at how we could possibly be named in such a last will and testament. Then, I turned the page - and there was a new will, dated three years later. It began the same way, with gifts to the same three friends. But from that point on, the will was radically different. For, you see, the next statement was a repudiation of the party at the bar. \"Just forget about it,\" he wrote. Then came the listing of the beneficiaries. There were only three - two Messianic ministries and our ministry. I immediately realized that I was holding in my hands absolute evidence of the existence of God and His miracle working power. It was obvious that during the three years between the two wills, this man had met Jesus, and his life and values had been totally transformed. That was not the first time I had seen such a radical impact of God on a life. Let me share with you another example. I have in mind a man named Jack Hollingsworth who lived on the streets as a homeless alcoholic for 20 years. In 1988 he wandered into a detox center in Lexington, Kentucky where he was confronted by a tough little lady named Sally. When he started trying to con her, she confronted him with his drunkenness and told him, \"I declare to you in the name of Jesus that you will never be able to get drunk again.\" Jack laughed and wrote her off as nuts. After all, he was a professional drunk, and he could get drunk any time he desired. But to his amazement, he discovered that he could no longer even get a buzz on, no matter how much he drank! Finally, he went back and asked Sally to tell him about Jesus. She did, and Jack put his faith in Him as his Lord and Savior. Jack was instantly delivered from alcoholism. He and Sally later married, and they formed a ministry called Acts 29. And ever since 1993 they have been on the road together, with Jack teaching, preaching and singing. And in the process, Jack became the featured singer on our TV program. What greater proof do you need that God exists? But Atheists renounce such proof out of hand by declaring it to be \"too subjective.\" \"Show me something objective and tangible,\" they declare. In the third segment of our study of how Israel proves the existence of God, we'll pause secondly to look at the proof of design by nature. Pope Francis and the Emerging One World Religion - By Michael Snyder - http://thetruthwins.com/archives/pope-francis-and-the-emerging-one-world-religion Is Pope Francis taking steps that are laying the groundwork for the emergence of a one world religion?  If that question sounds quite bizarre to you, I urge you to read the rest of this article.  We live at a time when globalization is advancing rapidly.  The global economy is more integrated than it has ever been before, and with each passing year new economic treaties tie us even more closely together.  And \"global governance\" (as the elite like to call it) is also steadily gaining ground.  Through a whole host of global institutions such as the United Nations, the World Bank, the IMF and the Bank for International Settlements, global governments are working together to a degree that is unprecedented.  Well, what about religion?  Is there evidence that we are also witnessing the globalization of religion?  Well, yes there is.  In fact, it appears that Pope Francis intends to lead the way. Since he has been Pope, Francis has expressed a desire for unity with the Eastern Orthodox, the Anglicans, and many other major Protestant denominations.  But more than a few eyebrows were raised when he recently sent a video message to Kenneth Copeland and his congregation.  At the time that the video message was played to the congregation, one speaker declared that \"Luther's protest is over\"... \"The Catholic and Charismatic Renewal is the hope of the Church,\" exclaims Anglican Episcopal Bishop Tony Palmer, before a group of cheering followers at the Kenneth Copeland Ministries.   Palmer said those words are from the Vatican. Before playing the video message from Pope Francis to Kenneth Copeland, Palmer told the crowd,  \"When my wife saw that she could be Catholic, and Charismatic, and Evangelical, and Pentecostal, and it was absolutely accepted in the Catholic Church, she said that she would like to reconnect her roots with the Catholic culture. So she did.\" The crowd cheered, as he continued, \"Brothers and sisters, Luther's protest is over. Is yours?\" Even Kenneth Copeland finds this development incredible: Said Copeland, \"Heaven is thrilled over this...You know what is so thrilling to me? When we went into the ministry 47 years ago, this was impossible.\" You can see video from this conference right here. So is Luther's protest really over? During the Council of Trent, the Catholics condemned to hell anyone that believes in salvation through faith in Jesus alone.  This is a direct quote from the Council of Trent... \"If any one saith, that by faith alone the impious is justified; in such wise as to mean, that nothing else is required to co-operate in order to the obtaining the grace of Justification, and that it is not in any way necessary, that he be prepared and disposed by the movement of his own will; let him be anathema\" The Catholics have never renounced that stand.  Instead, it has been reaffirmed many times over the years. If Pope Francis really did want to reach out to Protestants, he should start by reversing the Council of Trent on this.  As it stands, it is official Catholic doctrine that all Protestants are anathema. But apparently that is not going to stop many Protestants from reuniting with Rome and declaring Francis to be \"their Pope\". Meanwhile, Pope Francis has also been aggressively courting Muslims.  The following quote from Pope Francis comes from remarks that he made during his very first ecumenical meeting... I then greet and cordially thank you all, dear friends belonging to other religious traditions; first of all the Muslims, who worship the one God, living and merciful, and call upon Him in prayer, and all of you. I really appreciate your presence: in it I see a tangible sign of the will to grow in mutual esteem and cooperation for the common good of humanity. The Catholic Church is aware of the importance of promoting friendship and respect between men and women of different religious traditions - I wish to repeat this: promoting friendship and respect between men and women of different religious traditions - it also attests the valuable work that the Pontifical Council for interreligious dialogue performs. Apparently Pope Francis believes that Catholics and Muslims worship the same God. More recently, Francis made the following statement about Muslims... \"We must never forget that they 'profess to hold the faith of Abraham, and together with us they adore the one, merciful God, who will judge humanity on the last day.'\" By making this statement, Pope Francis is rejecting another of the most fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith. You see, Christians believe that Jesus Christ is God. Muslims hate this doctrine and say that there is no god but Allah. So how in the world can Christians and Muslims worship the same God? The only way that you could say this is if you deny the deity of Jesus Christ. For much more on why \"Allah\" and the God of Christianity are not the same, please see this article. Of course when it comes to other religions, Francis is not just reaching out to the Muslims.  During the same ecumenical meeting that I referenced above, he made it a point to say that he feels \"close\" to those that belong \"to any religious tradition\"... In this, we feel close even to all those men and women who, whilst not recognizing themselves belonging to any religious tradition, feel themselves nevertheless to be in search of truth, goodness and beauty, this truth, goodness and beauty of God, and who are our precious allies in efforts to defend the dignity of man, in building a peaceful coexistence among peoples and in guarding Creation carefully. And Francis really raised some eyebrows when he made the following statement about atheists... \"The Lord created us in His image and likeness, and we are the image of the Lord, and He does good and all of us have this commandment at heart: do good and do not do evil. All of us. 'But, Father, this is not Catholic! He cannot do good.' Yes, he can... The Lord has redeemed all of us, all of us, with the Blood of Christ: all of us, not just Catholics. Everyone! 'Father, the atheists?' Even the atheists. Everyone!.. We must meet one another doing good. 'But I don't believe, Father, I am an atheist!' But do good: we will meet one another there.\" There was a lot of debate about what Francis meant by that, and the Vatican issued a statement declaring that Catholic doctrine on these matters had not changed, but without a doubt a lot of people were troubled by this. In addition, a lot of people were really troubled when the Vatican offered \"indulgences\" to those that would follow Pope Francis on Twitter.  The following is an excerpt from an article that appeared in the Telegraph... Salvation - or at least a shorter stay in Purgatory - might now be only a tweet away with news that Pope Francis is to offer \"indulgences\" - remissions for temporary punishment - to the faithful who follow him on the social media site. Around 1.5 million are expected to flock to Rio de Janeiro to celebrate World Youth Day with the Argentine pontiff later this month. But for those who can't make it to Brazil,  forgiveness may be available to contrite sinners who follow Francis's progress via their TV screen or social networks. The Sacred Apostolic Penitentiary, the Vatican court that rules on the forgiveness of sins, has said that indulgences may be given to those who follow the \"rites and pious exercises\" of the event on television, radio and through social media. So what does Pope Francis actually believe? That is a very good question. His beliefs do not appear to be very consistent at all.  He just seems to have an overwhelming desire to \"unite\" with everyone out there that has any kind of religious faith. But we do know one kind of people that he does not like.  He does not like \"ideological Christians\" that take their faith very seriously... \"In ideologies there is not Jesus: in his tenderness, his love, his meekness. And ideologies are rigid, always. Of every sign: rigid. And when a Christian becomes a disciple of the ideology, he has lost the faith: he is no longer a disciple of Jesus, he is a disciple of this attitude of thought... For this reason Jesus said to them: 'You have taken away the key of knowledge.' The knowledge of Jesus is transformed into an ideological and also moralistic knowledge, because these close the door with many requirements. The faith becomes ideology and ideology frightens, ideology chases away the people, distances, distances the people and distances of the Church of the people. But it is a serious illness, this of ideological Christians. It is an illness, but it is not new, eh?\" So what is going to come of all this? It will be very interesting to watch. It is also interesting to note that there is a 900-year-old prophecy that seems to indicate that Pope Francis could be the last Pope.  If that prophecy is accurate, then we could very well be living at a time when we will see the emergence of a one world religion. Just a few short decades ago, a one world religion would have been absolutely unthinkable. But now the pieces are starting to come together, and it will be very interesting to see what happens next. I am very pleased to announce that the first DVD in \"The Book of Daniel\" DVD series is nearly complete. The first DVD in the series includes an Introduction to the Book of Daniel and also covers Chapters 1 & 2. There will be 5 more DVD's for a total of 6 for the series, each covering 2 chapters.  Almost everyone looks at the book of Daniel with a sense of wonder and anticipation, because this is usually regarded as a prophetic book foretelling the future. This is true. The book of Daniel, together with the book of Revelation, marvelously unfolds future events as God has ordained them in the program of history. By no means has this book yet been fulfilled, neither has the book of Revelation. These two books, one from the Old and one from the New Testament, remarkably complement each other in their symmetry and harmony. The book of Revelation explains the book of Daniel. The book of Daniel lays the basis for the book of Revelation. If you would like to know God's program for the future, it is essential that you understand this book of Daniel. The genre of the book of Daniel is Narrative History, Prophetic Oracle, and it includes Apocalyptic material. The prophet Daniel wrote it around 530 B.C. and his writings records the events of the Babylonian captivity in 560-536 B.C. to which Daniel was a servant. It also describes the apocalyptic visions given by God, and reveals the events and plans for everyone's future. Key personalities of this book include Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, Belshazzar, and Darius. The purpose of this book is to provide a historical account how the Lord God protected and provided for His faithful followers while in captivity. It also includes a vision of future redemption and hope. *    In chapters 1-6, Daniel writes about his own life in captivity. He was selected to work for the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel (or his Babylonian name Belteshazzar), and his friends made bold and tough decisions and several times displayed their integrity to stand for Godliness instead of culture. They rejecting the king's food, prayed when it was illegal to do so, and refused to bow to the king's idol, for which they were thrown into a scorching furnace. Daniel interpreted the king's dreams twice then was promoted as chief over all the wise men in Babylon. Yet, through all the great things that Daniel did He claimed it was God that did it through him and he gave all the glory to God, \"It is He who reveals the profound and hidden things; He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with Him\" (2:22). *    Chapters 7-12 contain the visions that Daniel received from God and the events that are involved in his prophetic ministry. A portion of these includes the results of the earthly kingdoms that he lived in. They also mention the coming Messiah and the apocalyptic events to come. \"As for me, I heard but could not understand; so I said, \"My lord, what will be the outcome of these events?\" He said, \"Go your way, Daniel, for these words are concealed and sealed up until the end time\" (12:8-9).

Carl sat at the doorway searching for those in need, his hands trembling cold as an arctic blast cut through the late night air. \"Hurry in, please hurry in,\" he said. More and more people hurried along. Some nearly crushing, Carl as they pushed into the building in desperation to feel the heat inside. \"More blankets honey,\" Carl cried out, \"More blankets! There's hot soup ya'll, so please eat up!\" As the last one made his way into the homeless shelter, Carl closed the door tight. Up in years and overworked for little or no pay, Carl surveyed the expansive room. Over at the end of one table sat a family of four. The mom hunkered near her youngest, rubbing her daughter's hands. She smiled to cover the shame and pain. Carl looked around carefully, so dearly wanting to make everything all right for everyone, unaware that he was sharing his heavenly Father's heart to love and console others. He hurried over to the woman and child, bringing warm blankets handed to him by his devoted wife, Edna. \"Here, here you are,\" Carl said, \"Please get warm.\"  The mother's eyes looked up. She embraced the warmth of not only the blankets, but the godly man. Hot soup, warm blankets and a night away from the bitter cold, something so many take for granted all across this world. As soon as everyone in the room had been served their bowls of soup, Carl asked permission to say a word and then pray. He began, \"Tonight, you are all here by invitation. These doors are always open and all you have to do is walk in. Please take a moment and look around. This has been a banquet dinner and I call you all-friends. But this is nothing compared to what you will be offered. There is even now, a banquet table being prepared. Your invitation, I have right here in my hand.\" Carl opened his Bible and began to read John 3:16, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believes upon him shall not perish but have everlasting life.\" Closing the Bible he slowly gazed at the sorrow-filled eyes all around the room. \"I beg you all to hear me. I hope I don't start to cry. Do you want to know when your invitation was sent out? The day Jesus died!   While you were yet lost in sin, lost in a cold cruel world, Jesus died for you. But three days later, he rose from that grave. When He did, doors flew open and a meal started to be prepared. It's called the \"Marriage Supper of the Lamb.\" Please don't be overlooked. Tonight sitting here in this humble banquet hall, please hear this old man. Please, let Jesus write your name in his accepted book, the Book of Life.\" In deepest humility, Carl called everyone in the room to the cross. Asking them to pray, Carl observed the forlorn faces in the crowded room. Respectfully bowing their heads, the group together prayed following Carl's lead. Outside that same evening, little Maria sat beside her mother. \"Mommy, I'm so, cold.\" Shivering to the core, the youngest, of two children clung to her mother's leg trying to hide her face from the wind. The mother observed at the desperate look in her husband, Jimmy's eyes; beaten down and hopeless-trying to withstand the bitter chill of the strong winds. Bankruptcy, foreclosure and medical bills to the max found their way onto this dad's shoulders and on this night, its total weight had come crashing down. They were homeless, helpless. In desperation, He cried out, \"Dear God, if you're up there PLEASE HELP!\"       Leaning against a heavy concrete wall, their young son, Brandon, bowed his head in despair, \"Oh God, why can't we be like everyone else and have our own place?\" Jimmy picked up his son with both arms and walked toward the shelter. His wife followed behind, their daughter tightly wrapped in her arms. Trash from the street was blowing all around them. The howling wind sent an eerie message of abandon. Up ahead they saw a door with a sign that said, \"Welcome Shelter.\" Jimmy began to knock on the door as if his very life depended on it. His family's heads were all hanging in shame. At life's most hopeless moment the door flew open and Carl began to urgently usher in the weather-torn family. \"Hurry in, please hurry in,\" he said. \"Hello, my name's Carl,\" as he shut the door for the night. He called out to his wife: \"Honey, more blankets please.\" Then turning to the family he said, \"Wow, you came just in time, we were ready to shut this place down for the night. Please have a warm blanket. Soup's on the stove and you're sure welcome to eat.\"      The family of four huddled up by an old table. It was a \"treat\" already to just have a table to sit at and a warm room to escape to. Wind chills outside were below zero. This family was happy to see clean cots all around, and steaming hot soup served to warm their hungry stomachs.  WHY?  Jimmy wondered...would anyone do this for so many strangers.  Then as they were eating, friendly old Carl began to speak-sharing the gospel again, \"You are all here by invitation...but let me tell you, of a future feast...\" The night was cold and chilly, but when Carl finished his plea, the entire family heard and answered that altar call. Almost immediately after...the shout came, \"COME UP HERE!\" They had been made ready! This is the eighth in my series of short stories, Preludes to the Rapture collection. Please feel free to download the stories as formatted and use them as witnessing material.  I wrote in this column several weeks back about nefarious movement afoot by those of the self-anointed political ruling class. We looked at how they are doing all within their power to keep the change that they have wrought over the last five years proceeding with as little resistance as possible. The article pointed out that the change promised was indeed successful to this point and destructive to the nation. It is plainly an all-out assault to, as written in that article, \"attempt to bring America into a socialistic model [that] has strapped working citizens, their children, grandchildren, and beyond with trillions of dollars of debt that can never be repaid. Many believe this has been done deliberately in order to bring the United States into configuration like and compliance with the New World Order the world's elite financiers and governmental leaders want to construct.\" My essay went on to state that these elitist, central planners, I believe, sense their momentum in continuing to change America fundamentally slipping away because of growing unpopularity among the voting public with the national healthcare system, power-grab debacle. -That, and other things such as a callous disregard for the rule of law and the U.S. Constitution. I wrote further that those elitists are increasingly worried that people such as Edward Snowden, the defected NSA consultant-whistle blower, and other rabble-rousers (in the elitists' view) are causing slippage of power from the globalists. These troublemakers are-in one elitist's own words--\"encouraging individuals to become self-empowered, eviscerating state control.\" The same writer, Harlan K. Ullman, indicated that a monumental crisis of some sort is needed to stop this slippage of power. Such a crisis, I infer Ullman is saying, will create the slavish call by we underlings, begging the national and international powers-that-be to continue having their way with us in controlling every aspect of our lives from cradle to grave. My conclusion was and is that the crisis the internationalists, the globalists, are wanting will happen at the time when the Rapture takes place. People will indeed be looking for that \"savior\" to rescue them. He will come riding in on that white horse of Revelation 6:2. We are witnessing signals of that coming Tribulation period upon the near-future horizon. The geopolitical landscape is electric with such signals as we have covered many times in this column and through news reports and, literally, thousands of articles. The socioeconomic, prophetic landscape is no less alive with signals of things to come. A bit of information this week pinpoints the preparation that is surely being made for paving Antichrist's way to control the Tribulation world's economy. As various tax-funded international institutions explicitly outline plans to plunder humanity's wealth to prop up governments drowning in odious debts, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) last week officially unveiled a new socialist-backed plot to create a global tax information-sharing regime to ensure that nobody except the establishment escapes the upcoming fleecing. Under the proposed scheme, admittedly inspired by \"FATCA,\" the Obama administration's latest addition to the sprawling U.S. tax regime, governments and dictatorships worldwide will automatically share all private financial data on citizens with each other to extract as much wealth as possible from the public. Calling its scheme to put the final nail in the coffin for financial privacy \"game changing,\" the tax-funded OECD said it would require governments to collect massive amounts of sensitive personal information on individuals from banks and other financial institutions in their jurisdictions. Once gathered, the vast troves of private data would be automatically exchanged between all participating governments and dictatorships... \"We call on other countries and jurisdictions to commit to join this initiative at the earliest opportunity with the aim of rapidly creating a truly global system of automatic information exchange,\" the governments continued in their joint statement. (osnetdaily, \"Globalists Unveil New World Tax Regime,\" Alex Newman, Feb. 18, 2014) Plans are well underway for that moment of great crisis for which the globalists-elite are no doubt praying. The true believer in Jesus Christ has no need to worry about that coming draconian system of absolute control over buying and selling. We are instructed by Jesus: \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also\" (Matthew 6:19-21).   Public wins stopping tyranny give way to more tyranny - Bill Wilson - www.dailyjot.com A week after reports that the DHS planned a national license plate recognition program, DHS decided on February 19 that it would not implement the program. A few days after America found out about the Federal Communications Commission plan to sit in news rooms and ask questions about news gathering, newsroom politics and other intimidations, the FCC said it was suspending the program. The occupant of the Oval Office has said that his administration would stop the IRS singling out conservative groups for audits and intimidation. All these are examples of soft tyranny because none of them in the end will be stopped--in fact, they are moving ahead despite assurances to the contrary. Engaget.com reports DHS decided it doesn't need a national database of everyone's license plates. Individual law enforcement units across the country already use license plate readers to track vehicles, and DHS wanted to connect them together to create a new National License Plate Recognition Database. Fox News reported that the program was stopped because the notice of it was posted without \"the awareness of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) leadership.\" But here's the real deal: DHS only postponed the program until the original proposal is reviewed by ICE. This means that after the public heat dies down, DHS will go forward with the program. The Washington Examiner reports that the FCC was working with USC's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Center for Communication and Democracy in developing criteria for what information is \"critical\" for Americans to have. Leftist billionaire George Soros' socialist Open Society Foundations has funded these schools to the tune of more than $1.8 million since 2000. These schools have even more ties to Soros, including faculty members writing for university-based publications allied with Soros-funded outlets. Meanwhile, the FCC plans to go ahead with the newsroom program without the controversial questions regarding journalistic practices. Uh-huh. The Examiner reported February 13 that Senate Democratic leadership openly called for more IRS targeting of conservative groups, hoping to quell criticism of their voting records ahead of the election. The Examiner had released a previous study saying \"100 percent of established 501(c)(4) groups audited by the IRS leaned to the right, and individuals who criticize [sic the president] are increasingly finding themselves targeted by the IRS.\" To sum up--all recent pledges to stop cracking down on your rights are temporary with plans to move rapidly forward. Jeremiah 6:14 says, \"They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.\" How does soft tyranny impact your life?  Going His Way? - Greg Laurie - www.harvest.org Can two people walk together without agreeing on the direction? I have a German shepherd that was a former guide dog for the blind. Because he had slight hip dysplasia, he was put up for adoption. When we got him, he was perfectly trained. We could take him anywhere. He was happy to sit next to us. Another dog would walk by and he couldn't care less. Then I got a hold of him. I would unleash him and let him run around in the park. Day by day he started getting worse. The next thing you know, he was lunging at dogs and taking off after cats and rabbits and squirrels. I called the people we got him from and asked what went wrong. They told me I couldn't let him do all that \"dog stuff.\" I couldn't let him stop and sniff where he wanted to sniff. I couldn't let him chase rabbits. They gave me a little muzzle like device to put on him. Gaining control of his muzzle meant he would obey, because it would hurt to pull away. When I took the device off him, he was in sync with me again. We can be like that with God sometimes. We are running around and being crazy, doing what we want to do. So the Lord has to pull us back into line because He wants us to walk with Him. To walk with God means that I must get into harmony with Him. I must go the direction that God wants me to go. How about you? Are you walking with God today? Or are you pulling against Him, trying to do things your own way? If so, then it's time to stop, ask God's forgiveness, and get in sync with Him once again.

The victim would be placed on a sturdy board and blindfolded. Four of us would then bend down and \"lift\" him a few inches from the floor. In \"lifting\" him we would make a show of the effort involved with appropriate grunts and groans. This was to convince the victim that he was being hoisted high up towards the ceiling. The subsequent chatter assured the unsuspecting student that we had him standing on our shoulders when in fact he was mere inches from the ground. Then, by bumping a piece of ceiling board on his head he was convinced that he was as high as the ceiling, and in a precarious place. Then at the right moment, one of us would pretend to buckle from the weight causing a collapse. The effect of the resulting \"fall\" on the student was, to say the least, entertaining. The deception convinced him that he was falling from ceiling height, when in reality he was only inches from the floor. The panic and sheer terror experienced by the student was a result of his belief. He believed himself to be where he was not. He did not reckon himself to be so close to safety. His piercing scream and unbridled terror were all unnecessary. He suffered massive stress simply because he was deceived and lied to about his true position. Are you too deceived as to who you are in Christ, and what your position in the family of God is? Romans 15:4 tells us, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.\" But not all Scripture is written TO you directly; it is there for you to learn from and not apply to yourself as though it were written directly TO you. Many of us have erroneous knowledge that does not work positively in our lives. For example, if you ask most people what is the one thing they know about the Ostrich, they will tell you that it sticks it head into the sand to avoid adversity. This is a falsehood; the ostrich does not stick its head into the sand. The reason for this myth is probably because \"credible\" people repeated the story with conviction. Even Africans, who live on the same continent as the Ostrich, use this false analogy. We all have a reservoir of untrue pre-programmed beliefs and assumptions that strongly influence our choices and decisions. The question is; \"Can we unlearn all the error we have accumulated over time.\" I recall as a very young man going to Sunday school at the local Anglican Church. In time I was old enough to be \"Confirmed\" as a member of the Anglican Church. It was not something I wanted to do so I resisted the whole idea. My mother, in an effort to \"encourage\" me to comply told me that when I got older and wanted to get a job I would need to be Confirmed before anyone would consider hiring me. I complied reluctantly and got to kiss the Bishop's ring. The point of this story is that for many years afterward I really believed that I would get work when I grew up because I was Confirmed in the Anglican Church. Most people have probably all seen a scene in a movie where the paramedic or doctor bares the chest of a patient, and rubs together the two ends of disc-like \"paddles,\" and shouts, \"Clear!\" He then administers the \"paddles\" to the bare chest of the patient who convulses violently, bouncing up and falling back in an undignified and somewhat comical manner. If the patient does not respond, the intensity of the machine is cranked up, and re-applied, resulting in even greater convulsions. This machine is called a \"Defibrillator.\" Do you need a spiritual defibrillation in order for you to get back on track? Have you become so remote from your first love that it would take something drastic to shock you back to reality? How many of us need some drastic outer influence to bring our hearts back to life especially in this day and at this hour. Are you excited for the soon return of Jesus? Are you enthusiastic about the Word of God? To digress slightly, it is interesting and worth mentioning here, that the English word \"enthusiasm\" is translated from two Greek words, \"En\" and \"Theos.\" Enthusiasm then really means, \"To have God inside; the result of this state of being, is the production of an ardent and lively interest or eagerness. FOLKS IT REALLY IS LATER THAN YOU THINK! GET ENTHUSIASTIC. This is a call to you, whom the Holy Spirit is speaking to. Is it going to take a dramatic shock, or a gentle massaging to bring your heart back from this world's charms and its entanglements? If the Divine Physician looks at you, will He find a pulse beating inside?  Are you expressing your true Life from within? Is there a humble heart beating with excitement and anticipation for the things of God? I would implore you to petition God to do a work in your life that will cause your heart to respond to the Christ within. Let His Life be your Life; living through you as you. This does not make you Christ, but it makes you Christ-like. It will not make you sinless, but you will sin less. You will be fulfilled, by living exactly as God intended you to, by Christ living through you as you are. Don't wait for some dramatic shocking experience to jolt you to your senses. Respond to the Holy Spirit today, and become what you already are in Christ; a child of God, and one who lives and moves and has his being in Christ. The Lord id near. If you'll allow me, I would like to make an analogy involving the computer. It is as if Jesus is installed in the hard drive of your being. Jesus is not on an external Storage Devise like a USB Flash Drive, Memory Stick, SD Card, or Disc to be stored in a drawer somewhere and hauled out only when necessary. Too many Christians think that they can keep Christ on an external drive somehow and when things go wrong they then load Him up and interact with Him. They seem ignorant of the fact that He is there with them in Person, wherever they are.  Their union with Christ is their spirit and His Spirit joining together becoming a \"New Creation.\" When you got born again Jesus Christ was uploaded as part of your \"software.\" Your \"hardware\" (the flesh) does not respond well to the new programming within you. It either rebels or it gets \"religious.\" The flesh can be religious in the sense that it fakes piety and goodness in order not to be exposed as a fraud by the truth. You do not have another life aside from the Life that is in you, and that is Christ.  \"When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.\" (Colossians 3: 4) We need to bolt this truth permanently into our thinking process. YOU HAVE NO LIFE ASIDE FROM CHRIST IN YOU. What about the sins we commit on a daily basis? The real you is not the hard drive, it is the software. But because we live in the lousy \"here and now,\" God in His great mercy and love for us has given us the Christian \"bar of soap.\" That bar of soap is 1 John 1: 9 \"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\" Philippians 3:20, 21 \"For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subdue all things to Himself.\" 1Corinthians 1:7 \"...so that you come short in no gift, eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ...\" 1Thessalonians 1:10 \"...and to wait for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.\" Titus 2:13 \"...looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ...\" Hebrews 9:28 \"...so Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly wait for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation.\" James 5:7 \"Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain.\" Mark 13:36, 37 \"...lest, coming suddenly, he find you sleeping. And what I say to you, I say to all: 'Watch'\" There is something else to consider in our \"occupying\" till the Lord comes. Noah knew 7 days before that the flood was going to happen. Lot knew that Sodom and Gomorrah was about to be destroyed. Elijah knew that he was about to be taken up to God. God does things in patterns, and it is not inconceivable that we too might \"know\" when the Rapture is about to happen. Seven days before seems like a good guess. In Luke's gospel Jesus wept over the coming destruction of Jerusalem, because they did not see Him as their Messiah. The coming of Messiah was accurately predicted by the prophet Daniel; to the degree that he even predicted the very day of His arrival. On the day prophesied by Daniel they spread their clothes in His path and waved palm branches as He went by. Rejoicing and celebration was the order of the day; but they missed the point of it all. They missed their Christ, the long awaited Messiah. Deeply distressed by their ignorance, Jesus said, \"...you did not know the time of your visitation.\" (Luke 19: 41-44) The Lord held Israel accountable for unbelief. Will we too be held accountable for unbelief about the Lords return? Could it be that the Lord is visiting your heart right now? Could it be that this is the time of your visitation from God? God expected the Jews to know that their Messiah was coming; He expects us to know the season of His return too because He said that we would not be ignorant concerning the Rapture. Much of the Church today are not Bereans. They have a taste for \"Feather Theology\" which tickles the ears. They are not too concerned about what the Scriptures say, but rather how it makes them feel. If one does not read and study the Bible, you open yourself up to error and heresy because you cannot discern what truth is and what fantasy is. Many there are that are on the broad road that leads to destruction thinking that all is well because the pastor said so.  I am not saying that you need some special education to understand the Bible. Everyone capable of reading can read for themselves what the Word of God says. The Holy Spirit will reveal God's Word to you about Jesus Christ if you are simply willing to spend time and effort reading His Word. If you are with a group where you need someone to interpret the Scriptures for you, you are in a cult. The Bible is shallow enough for the most immature Christian to get the milk he or she needs to be fed; but the Bible is deep enough to dive into depths that will bless us and sustain us for eternity. Sure there are \"difficulties\" from time to time in the Bible, but they are there by design in order for you to seek out the answers by being a \"Berean.\" It is always difficult when trying to encourage brothers and sisters to read the Bible for themselves and not to rely on TV evangelists or dubious books, of which there are many. Recently someone gave me this advice...\"It is better to be known for what you are FOR than what you are AGAINST.\" Having pondered on this matter I think that as Christians we are all FOR certain things. Things like the Bible; Righteousness; Purity; Goodness; Holiness etc. BUT being for these things automatically puts you at variance with those who do not hold the same values as you do. If you are for the Truth of the Word of God, you are by definition against those who teach error. There is no getting away from the fact that if you make a stand for the Truth, there will be enmity with error no matter the source of that error. There is no sitting on the fence or compromise when it comes to the Truth. If you sit on the fence, you are a prime target from both sides. The enemies you make by taking a decided stand for Truth generally have more respect for you than the friends you make by sitting on the fence. \"My concern is not whether God is on our side; my greatest concern is to be on God's side             for God is always right.\" - Abraham Lincoln. Agree to disagree without being disagreeable. Using this wonderful site I have recently gone \"public\" with my beliefs regarding the Rapture. The response has been heartwarming; to know that there are so many fellow travelers out there who long for the sound of the Trumpet as their Lord and Saviour calls them home. Not surprisingly I received many nasty e-mails in response to the articles submitted for scrutiny. This is of itself not problematic; people take offence, it is \"Par for the course.\" \"Hate mail\" is acceptable, even understandable when it comes to reprobates, misbelievers and the lost souls whose only taste of success is the bite they take out of you. There are those who disagree with the Doctrine of the Rapture. The Doctrine of the Rapture does not save you from your sin, so in some ways it is a peripheral matter. But dear brother or sister, do not take offence because someone else does believe the Doctrine of the Rapture. I personally disagree with many respectable scholars; but I have never had a rabid urge to make contact with them in order to insult them and make a judgment upon their lives that is not mine to make. \"Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations. For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.\" As a Christian I personally have way too much to be thankful for because I am a forgiven sinner. I am not sinless, but as I express Christ in me I sin less. The Scripture says \"Brethren, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, considering yourself lest you also be tempted.\" (Galatians 6:1)  Disagreeing on peripheral issues is not all bad because it prompts us to study and check out things for ourselves. The Bushman the Baboon and the Bush. Here in Africa the Bushmen have a clever method for catching baboons in a trap. They take a pumpkin or melon and cut into it a small hole, (just enough for a baboons hand to fit in tightly.) From this hole they scoop out some of the contents, and replace it with the baboon's favorite food. Then they hide nearby and simply wait. If you have ever observed baboons, you cannot help but come to the conclusion that God certainly has a sense of humor. They are truly comical creatures because they portray so many funny human-like qualities. The baboon approaches the juicy pumpkin, and inspects it cautiously. It sees the contents inside, and reaches in to take hold of the food. Here is where things go wrong for the baboon. Once the baboon has clenched a fist on the bait, he will not open his hand to let go; the result is that he now has a heavy pumpkin attached to the end of his arm; still he will not let go. Under different conditions, and given some time and thought, the baboon will figure out that he must open his fist in order to get free of the pumpkin. It is precisely at this moment that the concealed Bushman appears making much noise and spreading pandemonium. The baboon's mind is flooded with panic, and he simply cannot think logically, which keeps him clutching onto the bait that now ensnares him. Without too much trouble, the Bushman rushes up to the hapless baboon, and clubs it to death. Barbequed baboon is on the menu tonight in the bushman camp. And so it is with us if we take offence. If you are easily offended, you run the risk of being beaten up by the enemy. In order to be prepared for that great event called the Rapture, we all need to look at our lives. If there is any sin that holds us back we must reject it and repent of it TODAY. Not next week, but today. Make the decision that you will prepare yourself as a bride for her bridegroom. There are two components to our relationship with the Lord. The first is called union. Union is that unbreakable bond that was created when you first believed and the Holy Spirit came to dwell within you (Ephesians 1:13-14). Nothing you do can reverse that; you cannot become unborn. Union is the basis of our relationship with the Father. The second component is fellowship. It's the status of our relationship at any point in time, characterized by two-way communication between ourselves and God through the Holy Spirit.  True, all our sins were taken away at the cross (Colossians 2:13-14), however we have not yet been cured of our sin nature. That will come after the Rapture when we are glorified. If it were not so John wouldn't have counseled us to keep on praying for forgiveness when we do stumble and miss the mark set by God. God fixed it so that our ongoing tendency to sin wouldn't disqualify us for salvation. We're being made holy, because unholy beings cannot dwell in the presence of a holy God. We will one day soon be changed and made fit to dwell with Him in His Kingdom forever. But that hasn't happened yet, so to remain in fellowship now we have to \"clean up\" on a daily basis by seeking forgiveness for the sins we continue to commit. The benefit of staying in fellowship with Him is the incredible blessing and favour we receive from His Hand as He fulfills the role of Good Shepherd described in Psalm 23. To be out of fellowship with the Lord because of sin means losing out on day-to-day intimacy with Him. Sin in this instance is the sin you indulge in as a lifestyle. Get clean today. So, \"Union\" describes our eternal state, while \"Fellowship\" refers to our relationship in the here and now. The reason so many Christians live defeated lives is due to their failure to understand this difference. They come forward to receive the Lord and solve their eternal problem (union), but miss out on the tremendous blessing He can provide in the here and now (fellowship) by failing to confess and repent when they continue to sin.

kremlinbacked president yanukovych and replaced him with a former central banker named arseny yatseniuk while europe and the united states say that the new president has been legally appointed by the people of the ukraine yanukovych has publicly disagreed on russian television claiming that the appointment is illegitimate for his part russian president vladimir putin has remained largely silent over the affair – at least overtly behind the scenes however the former kgb operative has mobilized tens of thousands of troops and repositioned russian military assets around europe and even in our own backyard for all intents and purposes this buildup looks very much like a country preparing to go to war earlier this week national security adviser susan rice warned that russian troop intervention in the ukraine would be a grave mistake and that the issue of ukraine should be left to the people of that country this is not about the us and russia noted rice but with recent analysis suggesting that the us played a role in februarys ukranian revolution its clear that this is exactly what its about ukraine is said to be where russian civilization began that coupled with the fact that the carpathian mountains are a key strategic defense barrier for invasion and that russia has had a longstanding naval base in crimea one would be hardpressed to believe that vladimir putin will simply let the ukraine fall to western influence in the article below michael snyder of the economic collapse highlights twelve key signs suggesting that it would be a grave mistake for us to ignore russias determination to maintain control over the ukraine and crimea has the fuse on the powder keg been lit 12 signs that russia is ready to fight a war over crimea russia will never ever give up crimea without a fight anyone that thinks otherwise is just being delusional therussian black sea fleets main base at sevastopol is far too strategically important in addition ethnic russians make up approximately 60 percent of the population of crimea and most of the population is rabidly prorussian in fact many prominent crimean politicians are already calling for reunification with russia so if you have been thinking that russia is just going to fold up shop and go home now that proeuropean protesters have violently seized power in kiev you can quit holding your breath the truth is that russia is more than willing to fight a war over crimea and considering the fact that vitally important pipelines that pump natural gas from russia to the rest of europe go right through ukraine it is not likely that russia will just willingly hand the rest of ukraine over to the us and the eu either if the us and the eu push too hard in ukraine a major regional war may erupt which could ultimately lead to something much larger russia and ukraine have very deep historical ties most americans may not think that ukraine is very important but the russians consider ukraine to be of the utmost strategic importance as an american how would you feel if another nation funded and organized the violent overthrow of the democraticallyelected canadian government and replaced it with a government that was virulently antiamerican by doing this to ukraine the united states and the eu are essentially sticking a pin in russias eye needless to say russia is extremely angry at this point and they are gearing up for war the following are 12 signs that russia is ready to fight a war over crimea 1 more russian military vehicles continue to pour into crimea just check out this video 2 russian military vehicles have been photographed in the main square of sevastopol 3 russian military jets near the border with ukraine have been put on combat alert 4 russia has ordered surprise military exercises along the ukrainian border 5 in connection with those exercises it is being reported that russia has deployed 150000 troops along the border with ukraine 6 russia already has approximately 26000 troops stationed at their naval base in sevastopol 7 russian ships carrying additional soldiers have been spotted off the coast of crimea russias large landing ship nikolai filchenkov has arrived near the russia black sea fleets base at sevastopol which russia has leased from ukraine since the fall of the soviet union in 1991 the ship is reported to be carrying as many as 200 soldiers and has joined four additional ships carrying an unknown amount of special forces troops flotcom also reported over the weekend that personnel from the 45th airborne special forces unit and additional divisions had been airlifted into anapa a city on russias black sea coastline 8 russian defense minister sergei shoigu made the following statement to reporters on wednesday measures are taken to guarantee the security of our facilities 9 an unidentified russian official has told the financial times that russia is willing to use military force to protect crimea moscow earlier revealed that it would be ready to go for war over the crimea region in order to protect the large population and army installations if ukraine breaks apart it will trigger a war they will lose crimea first because we will go in and protect it just as we did in georgia an unidentified russian official told the financial times 10 officials in sevastopol have installed a russian citizen as mayor of the city 11 approximately 120 prorussian gunmen have seized the crimean parliament building and have raised the russian flag 12 there are rumors that russian authorities have offered protection to ousted ukrainian president viktor yanukovych viktor f yanukovych the ousted president of ukraine declared on thursday that he remained the lawful president of the country and appealed to russia to secure my personal safety from the actions of extremists russian news agencies reported that he had already arrived in russia but officials did not immediately confirm that no matter what the new government in kiev says and no matter how hard the us and the eu push russia will never give up crimea the following is what a recent debka article had to say about the matter there is no way that president vladimir putin will relinquish russian control of the crimean peninsula and its military bases there – or more particularly the big black sea naval base at sevastopol this military stronghold is the key to russias middle east policy if it is imperiled so too are russias military posture in syria and its strategic understandings with iran and you know what the people of crimea do not want russia to leave either in fact they overwhelmingly want russia to help defend them against the new government in kiev as you read this militia groups are being formed in crimea to fight back against the nationalist invasion that they are anticipating just check out the following excerpt from a recent time magazine article many of the people at the rally in sevastopol were not just ready to believe they were convinced of theimminent nationalist invasion what scared them most were the rightwing political parties and militant groups that have played a role in ukraines revolution what do you think theyre going to do with all those weapons they seized from police in kiev theyre going to come here and make war said sergei bochenko who identified himself as the commander of a local militia group in sevastopol called the southern russian cossack battalion in preparation he said his group of several hundred men had armed themselves with assault rifles and begun to train for battle theres not a chance in hell were going to accept the rule of that fascist scum running around in kiev with swastikas he said that may be overstating the case nowhere in ukraine has the uprising involved neonazi

            "text": "Editor’s Note: The back and forth struggle for territorial hegemony may soon be coming to a head on the Eastern Front. The west has ousted Kremlin-backed President Yanukovych and replaced him with a former central banker named Arseny Yatseniuk. While Europe and the United States say that the new President has been legally appointed by the people of the Ukraine, Yanukovych has publicly disagreed on Russian television, claiming that the appointment is “illegitimate.” For his part, Russian President Vladimir Putin has remained largely silent over the affair – at least overtly. Behind the scenes, however, the former KGB operative has mobilized tens of thousands of troops and re-positioned Russian military assets around Europe and even in our own backyard. For all intents and purposes, this build-up looks very much like a country preparing to go to war. Earlier this week national security adviser Susan Rice warned that Russian troop intervention in the Ukraine would be a “grave mistake,” and that the issue of Ukraine should be left to the people of that country. “This is not about the U.S. and Russia,” noted Rice. But with recent analysis suggesting that the U.S. played a role in February’s Ukranian revolution, it’s clear that this is exactly what it’s about.\n\nUkraine is said to be where Russian civilization began. That, coupled with the fact that the Carpathian Mountains are a key strategic defense barrier for invasion and that Russia has had a long-standing naval base in Crimea, one would be hard-pressed to believe that Vladimir Putin will simply let the Ukraine fall to western influence. In the article below Michael Snyder of The Economic Collapse highlights twelve key signs suggesting that it would be a grave mistake for us to ignore Russia’s determination to maintain control over the Ukraine and Crimea.\n\nHas the fuse on the powder keg been lit?\n\n12 Signs That Russia Is Ready To Fight A War Over Crimea\n\nRussia will never, ever give up Crimea without a fight. Anyone that thinks otherwise is just being delusional. TheRussian Black Sea fleet’s main base at Sevastopol is far too strategically important. In addition, ethnic Russians make up approximately 60 percent of the population of Crimea, and most of the population is rabidly pro-Russian. In fact, many prominent Crimean politicians are already calling for reunification with Russia. So if you have been thinking that Russia is just going to fold up shop and go home now that pro-European protesters have violently seized power in Kiev, you can quit holding your breath. The truth is that Russia is more than willing to fight a war over Crimea. And considering the fact that vitally important pipelines that pump natural gas from Russia to the rest of Europe go right through Ukraine, it is not likely that Russia will just willingly hand the rest of Ukraine over to the U.S. and the EU either. If the U.S. and the EU push too hard in Ukraine, a major regional war may erupt which could ultimately lead to something much larger.\n\nRussia and Ukraine have very deep historical ties. Most Americans may not think that Ukraine is very important, but the Russians consider Ukraine to be of the utmost strategic importance.\n\nAs an American, how would you feel if another nation funded and organized the violent overthrow of the democratically-elected Canadian government and replaced it with a government that was virulently anti-American?\n\nBy doing this to Ukraine, the United States and the EU are essentially sticking a pin in Russia’s eye. Needless to say, Russia is extremely angry at this point and they are gearing up for war.\n\nThe following are 12 signs that Russia is ready to fight a war over Crimea…\n\n#1 More Russian military vehicles continue to pour into Crimea. Just check out this video.\n\n#2 Russian military vehicles have been photographed in the main square of Sevastopol.\n\n#3 Russian military jets near the border with Ukraine have been put on combat alert.\n\n#4 Russia has ordered “surprise military exercises” along the Ukrainian border.\n\n#5 In connection with those “exercises”, it is being reported that Russia has deployed 150,000 troops along the border with Ukraine.\n\n#6 Russia already has approximately 26,000 troops stationed at their naval base in Sevastopol.\n\n#7 Russian ships carrying additional soldiers have been spotted off the coast of Crimea…\n\nRussia’s large landing ship Nikolai Filchenkov has arrived near the Russia Black Sea Fleet’s base at Sevastopol, which Russia has leased from Ukraine since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nThe ship is reported to be carrying as many as 200 soldiers and has joined four additional ships carrying an unknown amount of Special Forces troops. Flot.com also reported over the weekend that personnel from the 45th Airborne Special Forces unit and additional divisions had been airlifted into Anapa, a city on Russia’s Black Sea coastline.\n\n#8 Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu made the following statement to reporters on Wednesday…\n\n“Measures are taken to guarantee the security of our facilities.”\n\n#9 An unidentified Russian official has told the Financial Times that Russia is willing to use military force to protect Crimea…\n\nMoscow earlier revealed that it would be ready to go for war over the Crimea region in order to protect the large population and army installations.\n\n“If Ukraine breaks apart, it will trigger a war. They will lose Crimea first [because] we will go in and protect [it], just as we did in Georgia,” an unidentified Russian official told the Financial Times.\n\n#10 Officials in Sevastopol have “installed” a Russian citizen as mayor of the city.\n\n#11 Approximately 120 pro-Russian gunmen have seized the Crimean parliament building and have raised the Russian flag.\n\n#12 There are rumors that Russian authorities have offered protection to ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych…\n\nViktor F. Yanukovych, the ousted president of Ukraine, declared on Thursday that he remained the lawful president of the country and appealed to Russia to “secure my personal safety from the actions of extremists.” Russian news agencies reported that he had already arrived in Russia, but officials did not immediately confirm that.\n\nNo matter what the “new government” in Kiev says, and no matter how hard the U.S. and the EU push, Russia will never give up Crimea. The following is what a recent Debka article had to say about the matter…\n\nThere is no way that President Vladimir Putin will relinquish Russian control of the Crimean peninsula and its military bases there – or more particularly the big Black Sea naval base at Sevastopol. This military stronghold is the key to Russia’s Middle East policy. If it is imperiled, so too are Russia’s military posture in Syria and its strategic understandings with Iran.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nThe people of Crimea do not want Russia to leave either. In fact, they overwhelmingly want Russia to help defend them against the “new government” in Kiev.\n\nAs you read this, militia groups are being formed in Crimea to fight back against the “nationalist invasion” that they are anticipating. Just check out the following excerpt from a recent Time Magazine article…\n\nMany of the people at the rally in Sevastopol were not just ready to believe. They were convinced of theimminent nationalist invasion. What scared them most were the right-wing political parties and militant groups that have played a role in Ukraine’s revolution. “What do you think they’re going to do with all those weapons they seized from police in Kiev? They’re going to come here and make war,” said Sergei Bochenko, who identified himself as the commander of a local militia group in Sevastopol called the Southern Russian Cossack Battalion.\n\nIn preparation, he said, his group of several hundred men had armed themselves with assault rifles and begun to train for battle. “There’s not a chance in hell we’re going to accept the rule of that fascist scum running around in Kiev with swastikas,” he said. That may be overstating the case. Nowhere in Ukraine has the uprising involved neo-Nazi groups, and no swastikas have appeared on the revolution’s insignia. But every one of the dozen or so people TIME spoke to in Sevastopol was certain that the revolt was run by fascists, most likely on the payroll of the U.S. State Department.\n\nAnd just remember what happened back in 2008 in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The Russians have already shown that they are not afraid to militarily intervene in order to protect Russian citizens.\n\nSo what would the U.S. and the EU do if a war erupts between Russia and Ukraine?\n\nWould they risk a direct military confrontation with Russia in order to help Ukraine?\n\nI am very concerned about where all of this could be heading.\n\nWhat about you?\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nPlease feel free to share your thoughts by posting a comment below…\n\nMichael T.

been able to find toptier candidates in kansas and mississippi what isnt going the gops way right now its brand more unrest in ukraine is it possible well be talking more about foreign affairs come the fall than many expect dnc holds its winter meeting while rnc is set to announce its finalists to host 2016 convention obama to unveil my brothers keeper initiative at 325 pm et christie to raise money in boston dont miss hillary clintons comments on the healthcare law last night and good news and bad news for lindsey graham per that winthrop poll republicans expand the 2014 map increasing their chances of winning the senate so much different news has happened over the last 24 hours in arizona in ukraine but were leading with this the republican odds of picking up the senate increased after the denver post reported that rep cory gardner rco was entering colorados senate contest to challenge incumbent sen mark udall dco the move also set off a chain reaction with gop senate candidates ken buck and amy stephens dropping out the race and buck is now running for gardners open house seat funny how these things work huh but what gardner running does is put more seats in the 2014 playing field for republicans the gop no longer has to run the table of red states arkansas alaska louisiana north carolina and hope that democrats arent able to pull off an upset in georgia or kentucky now the gop has more margin for error by trying to pick off a race in michigan or colorado and everyone is waiting to see if former sen scott brown rma runs for the senate in new hampshire creating another potential pickup opportunity for gop back in the 2012 presidential race we constantly pointed out how many more different paths to 270 electoral votes barack obama had than mitt romney did which is why we and others always called him the favorite well senate republicans have a similar advantage right now they have more paths to netting six pickups than democrats do in blocking that gain think about this math the gop can lose both georgia and kentucky and still find eight demheld seats to net the six they need to win the majority this video player requires javascript it has come to our attention that the browser you are using is either not running javascript or out of date please enable javascript andor update your browser if possible meanwhile democrats still havent been able to find toptier candidates in kansas and mississippi the gardner recruitment highlights something else democrats so far have been unable to find key recruits in kansas and mississippi that could expand the playing field for them if republicans nominate a flawed candidate for the general election after a potential tea party debacle the dem path to saving their majority is getting narrower and narrower now they need a national recovery more than ever of the obama brand yet speaking of brand issues what isnt going the gops way right now its brand so republicans have a lot going for them so far an expanded map now putting colorado in play a favorable political environment see the new york timescbs poll but heres what should worry them and potentially hearten democrats the gop still has a brand problem and the recent news out of arizona only reemphasized that yes gov jan brewer r vetoed the controversial measure that could have allowed businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians but the entire story was a reminder how on some social issues todays republican party is out of step with the rest of america some of the other recent examples mike huckabees comment about democrats uncle sugar and women not controlling their libido and a virginia state senator appearing to refer to pregnant mothers as a host rather than a mother never mind the gop senate candidate in nc yesterday that called raising the minimum wage a dangerous idea see below for more on that and speaking of the gops brand heres another question will all the house republicans running for senate in 2014 have better luck than their 2012 colleagues two years ago the gop house members who ran for promotion in the senate rick berg in north dakota denny rehberg in montana connie mack iv in florida todd akin in missouri all lost so too did the house republican running for vice president paul ryan bottom line being a house republican wasnt necessarily the best resume especially with congress approval rating and the gop brand problems seem to stick easiest to house republicans or at least they have in the past but will that change in 2014 with gardner bill cassidy rla steve daines rmt and tom cotton rar all running for the senate this cycle more unrest in ukraine two stories out of ukraine this morning are a reminder that we could be talking about a completely different issue matrix come election day 2014 everyone is so sure the main issues will be health care the economy or inequality but what if its a sixmonth standoff with vladimir putin the first news dozens of armed men seized the regional government headquarters and parliament on ukraines crimea peninsula on thursday and raised the russian flag nbc news reported the second news viktor f yanukovych the ousted president of ukraine declared on thursday that he remained the lawful president of the country and appealed to russia to secure my personal safety from the actions of extremists the new york times adds yet dont miss what secretary of state john kerry told nbcs andrea mitchell yesterday president putin in a telephone conversation with president obama just the other day committed to respect the territorial integrity of ukraineand i think thats incredibly important it would be very difficult for me to understand how russia would reconcile its position on libya its position on syria its warnings against intervention in another country and then not respect the sovereignty of ukraine and the will of the people there we do not believe this should be an eastwest russiaunited states – this is not rocky iv believe me we dont see it that way dnc holds its winter meeting while rnc is set to announce its finalists to host 2016 convention the democratic national committee begins its threeday winter meeting in dc and on the lineup are speeches by vice president joe biden at 1130 am et today and president obama tomorrow afternoon perhaps timed to the start of the dnc meeting the republican national committee will announce the final cities under consideration for the gops 2016 convention at 1000 am et via rnc chair reince priebus twitter feed the dnc has yet to narrow down its field in fact its just beginning its bidding process obama to unveil my brothers keeper initiative per nbcs kristen welker president obama at 325 pm et will hold an event at the white house to unveil his my brothers keeper initiative to help lift up young minorities building on his year of action this new initiative is another way the president will use his pen and his phone involving both the private and public sectors to expand opportunity for americans the white house says christie to raise money in boston also on our schedule today new jersey gov chris christie is hosting a closedpress rga fundraiser with mitt romney in boston dont miss hillary clintons comments on the healthcare law last night hillary clinton offered a defense of obamacare – but struck a note of concern for small business owners whove complained about mandates required by the law – in a twin set of speeches in florida on wednesday i think we are on the right track in many respects but i would be the first to say if things arent working then we need people of good faith to come together and make evidencebased changes clinton said at the first event politico writes but do note hillary really didnt say anything different than weve heard from president obama on fixes gop senate candidate calls minimum wage a dangerous idea turning back to other 2014 news democrats are seizing on this story us senate candidate thom tillis on wednesday said he opposes president barack obamas plan to increase the federal minimum wage calling it a dangerous idea the republican went even further to suggest government shouldnt set a minimum wage labeling it an artificial threshold tillis is viewed as the gop frontrunner to challenge sen kay hagan dnc and its another reminder how democrats are trying use the minimum wage as a key part of their 2014 playbook good news and bad news for lindsey graham finally a recent winthrop poll out of south carolina contains good news and bad news for sen lindsey graham rsc ahead of his primary later this year the good news hes leading the gop primary getting 45 though thats below the 50 threshold needed to avoid a runoff but heres the bad news the poll shows you that this is your gop electorate in south carolina – 93 disapprove of obamas job 95 think the nation is headed in the wrong direction though 67 think south carolina is headed in the right direction 63 say its unacceptable for having a child without being married 21 say its unacceptable for blacks and whites to intermarry and 74 think its unacceptable for adults to smoke marijuana this is a very conservative electorate and lindsey graham is running as much against a number getting that 50 than running against the rest of the gop field click here to sign up for first

            "text": "Republicans expand the 2014 map, increasing their chances of winning the Senate… Meanwhile, Democrats still haven’t been able to find top-tier candidates in Kansas and Mississippi… What isn’t going the GOP’s way right now: its brand… More unrest in Ukraine: Is it possible we’ll be talking more about foreign affairs come the fall than many expect?... DNC holds its winter meeting, while RNC is set to announce its finalists to host 2016 convention… Obama to unveil “My Brother’s Keeper” initiative at 3:25 pm ET… Christie to raise money in Boston… Don’t miss Hillary Clinton’s comments on the health-care law last night… And good news and bad news for Lindsey Graham per that Winthrop poll.\n\nRepublicans expand the 2014 map, increasing their chances of winning the Senate\n\nSo much different news has happened over the last 24 hours (in Arizona, in Ukraine), but we’re leading with this: The Republican odds of picking up the Senate increased after the Denver Post reported that Rep. Cory Gardner (R-CO) was entering Colorado’s Senate contest to challenge incumbent Sen. Mark Udall (D-CO). The move also set off a chain reaction with GOP Senate candidates Ken Buck and Amy Stephens dropping out the race, and Buck is now running for Gardner’s open House seat. (Funny how these things work, huh?) But what Gardner running does is put more seats in the 2014 playing field for Republicans. The GOP no longer has to run the table of red states (Arkansas, Alaska, Louisiana, North Carolina) and hope that Democrats aren’t able to pull off an upset in Georgia or Kentucky. Now the GOP has more margin for error by trying to pick off a race in Michigan or Colorado. And everyone is waiting to see if former Sen. Scott Brown (R-MA) runs for the Senate in New Hampshire, creating another potential pick-up opportunity for GOP. Back in the 2012 presidential race, we constantly pointed out how many more different paths to 270 electoral votes Barack Obama had than Mitt Romney did, which is why we and others always called him the favorite. Well, Senate Republicans have a similar advantage right now -- they have more paths to netting six pickups than Democrats do in blocking that gain. Think about this math: The GOP can lose both Georgia and Kentucky and still find eight Dem-held seats to net the six they need to win the majority.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats still haven’t been able to find top-tier candidates in Kansas and Mississippi\n\nThe Gardner recruitment highlights something else: Democrats so far have been unable to find key recruits in Kansas and Mississippi that could expand the playing field for them if Republicans nominate a flawed candidate for the general election after a potential Tea Party debacle. The Dem path to saving their majority is getting narrower and narrower. Now they need a national recovery more than ever of the Obama brand. Yet speaking of brand issues…\n\nWhat isn’t going the GOP’s way right now: its brand\n\nSo Republicans have a lot going for them so far. An expanded map (now putting Colorado in play). A favorable political environment (see the New York Times/CBS poll). But here’s what should worry them and potentially hearten Democrats: The GOP still has a brand problem, and the recent news out of Arizona only re-emphasized that. Yes, Gov. Jan Brewer (R) vetoed the controversial measure that could have allowed businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians, but the entire story was a reminder how -- on some social issues -- today’s Republican Party is out of step with the rest of America. Some of the other recent examples: Mike Huckabee’s comment about Democrats, Uncle Sugar, and women not controlling their libido, and a Virginia state senator appearing to refer to pregnant mothers as a “host” rather than a mother. Never mind the GOP senate candidate in NC yesterday that called raising the minimum wage a “dangerous idea” (see below for more on that). And speaking of the GOP’s brand, here’s another question: Will all the House Republicans running for Senate in 2014 have better luck than their 2012 colleagues? Two years ago, the GOP House members who ran for promotion in the Senate (Rick Berg in North Dakota, Denny Rehberg in Montana, Connie Mack IV in Florida, Todd Akin in Missouri) all lost. So too did the House Republican running for vice president, Paul Ryan. Bottom line: Being a House Republican wasn’t necessarily the best resume, especially with Congress’ approval rating. And the GOP brand problems seem to stick easiest to House Republicans, or at least they have in the past. But will that change in 2014, with Gardner, Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Steve Daines (R-MT), and Tom Cotton (R-AR) all running for the Senate this cycle?\n\nTwo stories out of Ukraine this morning are a reminder that we COULD be talking about a completely different issue matrix come Election Day 2014. Everyone is so sure the main issues will be health care, the economy, or inequality. But what if it’s a six-month standoff with Vladimir Putin? The first news: “Dozens of armed men seized the regional government headquarters and parliament on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula on Thursday and raised the Russian flag,” NBC News reported. The second news: “Viktor F. Yanukovych, the ousted president of Ukraine, declared on Thursday that he remained the lawful president of the country and appealed to Russia to “secure my personal safety from the actions of extremists,” the New York Times adds. Yet don’t miss what Secretary of State John Kerry told NBC’s Andrea Mitchell yesterday: “President Putin, in a telephone conversation with President Obama just the other day, committed to respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine.And I think that’s incredibly important. It would be very difficult for me to understand how Russia would reconcile its position on Libya, its position on Syria, its warnings against intervention in another country and then not respect the sovereignty of Ukraine and the will of the people there... We do not believe this should be an East-West, Russia-United States – this is not Rocky IV, believe me. We don’t see it that way.”\n\nDNC holds its winter meeting, while RNC is set to announce its finalists to host 2016 convention\n\nThe Democratic National Committee begins its three-day winter meeting in DC, and on the line-up are speeches by Vice President Joe Biden (at 11:30 am ET today) and President Obama (tomorrow afternoon). Perhaps timed to the start of the DNC meeting, the Republican National Committee will announce the final cities under consideration for the GOP’s 2016 convention at 10:00 am ET via RNC Chair Reince Priebus’ Twitter feed. The DNC has yet to narrow down its field; in fact, it’s just beginning its bidding process.\n\nPer NBC’s Kristen Welker, President Obama at 3:25 pm ET will hold an event at the White House to unveil his “My Brother’s Keeper” initiative -- to help lift up young minorities. “Building on his Year of Action, this new initiative is another way the President will use his pen and his phone, involving both the private and public sectors, to expand opportunity for Americans,” the White House says.\n\nAlso on our schedule today: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is hosting a closed-press RGA fundraiser with Mitt Romney in Boston.\n\nDon’t miss Hillary Clinton’s comments on the health-care law last night\n\n“Hillary Clinton offered a defense of Obamacare – but struck a note of concern for small business owners who’ve complained about mandates required by the law – in a twin set of speeches in Florida on Wednesday. ‘I think we are on the right track in many respects but I would be the first to say if things aren’t working then we need people of good faith to come together and make evidence-based changes,’ Clinton said at the first event,” Politico writes. But do note: Hillary really didn’t say anything different than we’ve heard from President Obama on fixes.\n\nTurning back to other 2014 news, Democrats are seizing on this story: “U.S. Senate candidate Thom Tillis on Wednesday said he opposes President Barack Obama’s plan to increase the federal minimum wage, calling it a ‘dangerous idea.’ The Republican went even further to suggest government shouldn’t set a minimum wage, labeling it an ‘artificial threshold.’” Tillis is viewed as the GOP front-runner to challenge Sen. Kay Hagan (D-NC), and it’s another reminder how Democrats are trying use the minimum wage as a key part of their 2014 playbook.\n\nFinally, a recent Winthrop poll out of South Carolina contains good news -- and bad news -- for Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) ahead of his primary later this year. The good news: He’s leading the GOP primary getting 45% (though that’s below the 50% threshold needed to avoid a run-off). But here’s the bad news: The poll shows you that this is your GOP electorate in South Carolina – 93% disapprove of Obama’s job, 95% think the nation is headed in the wrong direction (though 67% think South Carolina is headed in the right direction), 63% say it’s unacceptable for having a child without being married, 21% say it’s unacceptable for blacks and whites to inter-marry, and 74% think it’s unacceptable for adults to smoke marijuana. This is a VERY conservative electorate, and Lindsey Graham is running as much against a number (getting that 50%) than running against the rest of the GOP field.\n\nClick here to sign up for First Read emails.

their irrational call of the soil and blood and why hungarian nationalists are not only concerned with gypsy crime or with their government sellout of the national treasure to foreign sharks but also with the fact that one third of hungarys historical land still belongs to neighboring romania and slovakia it must be amusing to observe from the american watchtower how white nationalists in europe

these territorial cultural or linguistic disputes are a matter of life and death the list goes on and on all over europe the case study is a traumatic croatian nationalism which expresses itself as a

likely to respond in some fashion to such a stinging geopolitical defeat israel shamir in counterpunch provides some details to the role of ukrainian nationalists in the coup the us and the eu won this round and pushed russia back eastwards just as they intended it remains to be seen whether the neonazi thugs who won the battle will agree to surrender the sweet fruits of victory to politicians who are god knows nasty enough the brown revolution in ukraine congruent with a variety of sources shamir sees the antiyanukovych forces as an alliance between liberals and ukrainian nationalists however the ultimate fate of the nationalist element within the next government is uncertain at best within the nationalist element there are two main groups the right sector motivated by hostility toward russia and tracing their origins to the progerman ukrainians in wwii and svoboda a nationalist political party that opposes teaching of the russian language in schools and won 1044 of the popular vote in the 2012 elections wikipedia notes that svoboda has been described as an antisemitic and sometimes a neonazi party by international newspapers organizations that monitor hate speech jewish organizations and political opponents the right sector is described in a globe and mail toronto article have ukraines protests been taken over by this ultrarightwing group as an ultrarightwing movement described by some as fascist whose hundreds of soldiers they call themselves an army have become the sharp edge of the twomonthold protest movement that has upturned the politics of ukraine cost several lives and forced president viktor yanukovych to dismiss the government and promise to reform the constitution the people in the largest and most aggressive group who generally refuse to speak to journalists are members of pravy sektor an umbrella group of fascist nationalist footballhooligan and rightwing extremist gangs – some with neonazi histories – which is generally considered to the right of svoboda and which tends to be very secretive it has not to this point been a political party see also paul craig roberts on the critical role of the right sector in the coup shamir describes some of that history in the western ukraine the serpent eggs hatched children of nazi collaborators who had imbibed hatred towards the russians with their mothers milk their fathers had formed a network under reinhard gehlen the german spymaster in 1945 as germany was defeated gehlen swore allegiance to the us and delivered his networks to the cia they continued their guerrilla war against the soviets until 1956 their cruelty was legendary for they aimed to terrify the population into full compliance to their command notoriously they strangulated the ukrainians suspected of being friendly to russians with their bare hands a horrifying confession of a participant tells of their activities in volyn one night we strangulated 84 men we strangulated adults as for little kids we held their legs swung and broke their heads at a doorpost two nice kids stepa and olya 12 and 14 years old we tore the younger one into two parts and there was no need to strangulate her mother julia she died of a heart attack and so on and so on they slaughtered hundreds of thousands of poles and jews even the dreadful baby yar sic massacre was done by them with german connivance somewhat similar to israeli connivance in the sabra and chatila massacres of palestinians by the lebanese fascists of the phalange the children of these bandera murderers were brought up to hate communism soviets and russians and in adoration of their fathers deeds they formed the spearhead of the prous antigovernment rebels in the ukraine the right sector led by outandout fascist dmytro yarosh they were ready to fight to die and kill such units attract potential rebels of differing backgrounds their spokesman is young russian turned ukrainian nationalist artem skoropadsky a journalist with the mainstream oligarchowned kommersantua daily there are similar young russians who join salafi networks and become suicidebombers in the caucasus mountains – young people whose desire for action and sacrifice could not be satisfied in the consumer society this is a slav alqaeda — real neonazi storm troopers a natural ally of the us and they did not fight only for association with ec and against joining a russialed tc their enemies were also the russians in the ukraine and russianspeaking ethnic ukrainians the difference between the twain is moot before independence in 1991 some three quarters of the population preferred to speak russian since then successive governments have tried to force people to use ukrainian for the ukrainian neonazis anyone who speaks russian is an enemy the other nationalist group is affiliated with svoboda behind the spearhead of the right sector with its fervent anticommunist and antirussian fighters a larger organisation could be counted on the neonazi freedom svoboda of tyagnibok some years ago tyagnibok called for a fight against russians and jews now he has become more cautious regarding the jews he is still as antirussian as john foster dulles so we have the specter of dueling nationalisms plus a strong dose of liberals among the antiyanukovych forces all aided by a large dose of us intervention shamir the west was extremely active the us state department representative victoria fuck ec nuland who has impeccable neocon credentials had spent days and weeks in kiev feeding the insurgents with cookies delivering millions of smuggled greenbacks to them meeting with their leaders planning and plotting the coup kiev is awash with the newest us dollars fresh from its mint of a kind yet unseen in moscow ive been told by russian friends the us embassy spread money around like a tipsy texan in a night club every ablebodied young man willing to fight received five hundred dollar a week a qualified fighter – up to a thousand a platoon commander had two thousand dollars – good money by ukrainian standards the us and the neocons favor the liberal contingent among the protestors and i assume that they will do what they can to push the nationalists aside in the new government despite their very prominent role in the coup obviously the us spearheaded by the neocons favors a strong ukrainian connection to the eu to the detriment of russia but some very powerful forces have been unleashed by all this and the end game is not predictable what is clear is that ukraine is another example of ageold competing european nationalisms for time being forced to coexist sidebyside in a multicultural multiethnic state the eu solution to all of this is to obliterate all borders at least within europe—a solution that is diametrically opposed to what nationalists of all stripes want ever on the lookout for white people with strong ethnicracial identities richard cohen of the washhington post wants the us to use its power to oppose all these rising european nationalisms in catalonia scotland belgium the northern league in italy etc he has no problem with israeli and noneuropean nationalisms the worst part is that the eu combines its freedom of movement within europe policy with massive noneuropean immigration resulting in the same sorts of tensions within european societies that competing nationalisms engender —ethnic and religious strife indeed the eu solution to the nationalism problem is the worst of all possible worlds resulting not only in high levels of tension and strife that we already see within european societies but in the long run in the obliteration of all traditional european national cultures this is because eu policy favors highly fertile and aggressive unassimilable religious and ethnic groups that will eventually make native europeans a relatively powerless minority in areas they have controlled for thousands of years it is very difficult to see how a ukrainian nationalist could be optimistic about the longterm effects of allying ukraine with the eu the very clear signs of discontent with the eu precisely because of the obliteration of national cultures should be a clear sign to the antirussian ukrainian nationalists that the eu is not the answer a better solution would be to break up states like ukraine with large ethnic divisions into ethnically homogeneous societies but to also develop a consensus that the territorial wars fueled by nationalism should be a thing of the european past europeans must find unity in the face of the massive invasions of noneuropeans that have occurred throughout the west that may be a tall order but the way of the eu with its present policies is suicide for all european peoples",

            "text": "In “Which Way White Man?,” Tom Sunic discusses the downside of European nationalism:\n\nThe Hungarian nationalist party Jobbik has had significant success in its PR overtures in the mainstream media in Europe and it deserves to be commended. Yet, few White American nationalists can comprehend their irrational call of the soil and blood and why Hungarian nationalists are not only concerned with Gypsy crime or with their government sell-out of the national treasure to foreign sharks, but also with the fact that one third of Hungary’s historical land still belongs to neighboring Romania and Slovakia. It must be amusing to observe from the American watchtower how White nationalists in Europe endlessly quarrel about which state in their vicinity should be in charge of a small creek in Transylvania or swaths of former German lands in today’s Silesia. For Europe’s White nationalists, however, these territorial, cultural, or linguistic disputes are a matter of life and death. The list goes on and on all over Europe. The case study is a traumatic Croatian nationalism, which expresses itself, as a rule, in rigid papist ultra-Catholicism and which establishes its negative legitimacy in the endless name-calling of Christian Orthodox Serbs. A question: Can one be a good White nationalist without excluding the Other White nationalist?\n\nWe are certainly seeing some of that now in Ukraine. Ukraine is a textbook case of the costs of multiculturalism, a story of competing nationalisms. Around 17% of the population, mainly in the in the East and South of Ukraine, is ethnically Russian and favors strong ties with Russia. \n\n\n\nNow government buildings in the Crimea have been seized by Russian sympathizers:\n\nMasked men with guns seized government buildings in the capital of Ukraine’s Crimea region on Thursday, barricading themselves inside and raising the Russian flag after mysterious overnight raids that appeared to be the work of militant Russian nationalists who want this volatile Black Sea region ruled from Moscow. Police officers sealed off access to the buildings but said that they had no idea who was behind the assault, which sharply escalated tensions in a region that serves as home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and also to a number of radical pro-Russia groups that have appealed to Moscow to protect them from the new interim government in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital. … In Crimea … a heavily ethnic Russian and Russian-speaking population mostly views the Ukrainian government installed after the ouster last weekend of Mr. Yanukovych as the illegitimate result of a fascist coup. … Outside the occupied legislature building, columns of several hundred pro-Russia protesters forced their way through police lines chanting “Rossiya, Rossiya” — “Russia, Russia” — and waving Russian flags. The leader of a group called the Russian Movement for Crimea read out Mr. Yanukovych’s reported statement declaring himself to be the legitimate president. “We agree, we agree,” the crowd shouted. One man shouted through a bullhorn: “We are not separatists. Russia, Ukraine and Belarus are one country.”\n\nLending more ethnic complexity to the situation, the Tatar population in the Crimea is opposed to strong ties with Russia and opposes Crimea splitting off from Ukraine:\n\nRefat Chubarov, a member of the assembly and a leader of Crimea’s ethnic Tatar minority, … warned that any vote to separate Crimea from Ukraine would be “very dangerous.” Asserting that Russian armored vehicles were waiting outside the city, he called for calm but also urged Tatar residents to form “self-defense” units to protect their interests. He blamed pro-Russia forces for the overnight seizure of government buildings, describing the action as “a direct interference in the affairs of Crimea and of Ukraine.” The overnight raids left Simferopol [capital of Crimea] residents stunned and took place just hours after thousands of Crimean Tatars, the region’s minority indigenous Turkic population, and a separate throng of ethnic Russians staged dueling rallies Thursday outside Crimea’s regional legislature. The rallies, which ended in a chaotic melee and left several people injured, disrupted a session of the regional Parliament that hard-line pro-Russia groups had hoped would declare Crimea’s secession from Ukraine. “This is the first step toward civil war,” said Igor Baklanov, a computer expert who joined a group of anxious residents gathered in a cold drizzle at a police line near the seized regional legislature. Rumors swirled of Russian troops on the way from Sevastopol, the headquarters of Russia’s fleet, of Russian nationalists arriving in force to reinforce the blockaded government buildings and of negotiations between the local authorities and the unidentified gunmen. … Eight hundred miles away, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered a surprise military exercise of ground and air forces on Ukraine’s doorstep on Wednesday, adding to the tensions with Europe and the United States and underscoring his intention to keep Ukraine in Moscow’s orbit. … While few analysts expected a Russian military intervention in Ukraine, most said that Mr. Putin was likely to respond in some fashion to such a stinging geopolitical defeat.\n\nIsrael Shamir in Counterpunch provides some details to the role of Ukrainian nationalists in the coup:\n\nCongruent with a variety of sources, Shamir sees the anti-Yanukovych forces as an alliance between liberals and Ukrainian nationalists. However, the ultimate fate of the nationalist element within the next government is uncertain at best.\n\nWithin the nationalist element, there are two main groups, the Right Sector,  motivated by hostility toward Russia and tracing their origins to the pro-German Ukrainians in WWII, and Svoboda, a nationalist political party that opposes teaching of the Russian language in schools and won 10.44% of the popular vote in the 2012 elections. Wikipedia notes that “Svoboda has been described as an anti-Semitic and sometimes a Neo-Nazi party by international newspapers, organizations that monitor hate speech, Jewish organizations, and political opponents.“\n\nThe Right Sector is described in a Globe and Mail (Toronto) article (“Have Ukraine’s protests been taken over by this ultra-right-wing group?“) as an\n\n\n\n Shamir describes some of that history:\n\nIn the Western Ukraine, the serpent eggs hatched: children of Nazi collaborators who had imbibed hatred towards the Russians with their mothers’ milk. Their fathers had formed a network under Reinhard Gehlen, the German spymaster. In 1945, as Germany was defeated, Gehlen swore allegiance to the US and delivered his networks to the CIA. They continued their guerrilla war against the Soviets until 1956. Their cruelty was legendary, for they aimed to terrify the population into full compliance to their command. Notoriously, they strangulated the Ukrainians suspected of being friendly to Russians with their bare hands. A horrifying confession of a participant tells of their activities in Volyn: “One night, we strangulated 84 men. We strangulated adults, as for little kids, we held their legs, swung and broke their heads at a doorpost. …Two nice kids, Stepa and Olya, 12 and 14 years old… we tore the younger one into two parts, and there was no need to strangulate her mother Julia, she died of a heart attack” and so on and so on. They slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Poles and Jews; even the dreadful Baby Yar [sic] massacre was done by them, with German connivance, somewhat similar to Israeli connivance in the Sabra and Chatila massacres of Palestinians by the Lebanese fascists of the Phalange. The children of these Bandera murderers were brought up to hate Communism,  Soviets and Russians, and in adoration of their fathers’ deeds. They formed the spearhead of the pro-US anti-government rebels in the Ukraine, the Right Sector led by out-and-out fascist Dmytro Yarosh. They were ready to fight, to die and kill. Such units attract potential rebels of differing backgrounds: their spokesman is young Russian -turned -Ukrainian -nationalist Artem Skoropadsky, a journalist with the mainstream oligarch-owned Kommersant-UA daily. There are similar young Russians who join Salafi networks and become suicide-bombers in the Caucasus mountains – young people whose desire for action and sacrifice could not be satisfied in the consumer society. This is a Slav al-Qaeda — real neo-Nazi storm troopers, a natural ally of the US. And they did not fight only for association with EC and against joining a Russia-led TC. Their enemies were also the Russians in the Ukraine, and Russian-speaking ethnic Ukrainians. The difference between the twain is moot. Before independence in 1991, some three quarters of the population preferred to speak Russian. Since then, successive governments have tried to force people to use Ukrainian. For the Ukrainian neo-Nazis, anyone who speaks Russian is an enemy.\n\nThe other nationalist group is affiliated with Svoboda:\n\nSo we have the specter of dueling nationalisms, plus a strong dose of liberals among the anti-Yanukovych forces, all aided by a large dose of U.S. intervention. Shamir:\n\nThe U.S. and the neocons favor the liberal contingent among the protestors and I assume that they will do what they can to push the nationalists aside in the new government despite their very prominent role in the coup. Obviously, the U.S., spearheaded by the neocons, favors a strong Ukrainian connection to the EU, to the detriment of Russia. But some very powerful forces have been unleashed by all this, and the end game is not predictable.\n\nWhat is clear is that Ukraine is another example of age-old competing European nationalisms, for time being forced to co-exist side-by-side in a multicultural, multiethnic state.\n\nThe EU solution to all of this is to obliterate all borders, at least within Europe—a solution that is diametrically opposed to what nationalists of all stripes want. (Ever on the lookout for White people with strong ethnic/racial identities, Richard Cohen of the Washhington Post wants the U.S. to use its power to oppose all these rising European nationalisms [in Catalonia, Scotland, Belgium, the Northern League in Italy, etc.; he has no problem with Israeli and non-European nationalisms].) The worst part is that the EU combines its freedom of movement within Europe policy with massive non-European immigration, resulting in the same sorts of tensions within European societies that competing nationalisms engender —ethnic and religious strife.\n\nIndeed, the EU solution to the nationalism problem is the worst of all possible worlds, resulting not only in high levels of tension and strife that we already see within European societies, but in the long run in the obliteration of all traditional European national cultures.

There is strong congressional support for providing aid to Ukraine, he said.\n\nUkraine’s interim government is seeking as much as $35 billion in financial aid to avoid a default after Viktor Yanukovych was ousted from the presidency last week amid deadly protests. The U.S. guarantee may speed initial aid because past IMF aid proposals for Ukraine led to protracted negotiations, as the country’s leaders balked at austerity measures demanded by the lender.\n\nKerry said it was important to move quickly. “We don’t know yet the full financial dilemma facing them, although we know it’s pretty dire,” he said.\n\nThe top U.S. diplomat warned against any Russian intervention in Ukraine, after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered military exercises in the western part of his country that were described as a test of battle readiness.\n\n“For a country that has spoken out so frequently in the last year that I’ve been secretary of state and so strongly against foreign intervention in Libya, Syria and elsewhere, it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of Ukraine,” Kerry said.\n\n“I don’t think there should be any doubt whatsoever that any kind of military intervention that would violate the sovereign territorial integrity of Ukraine would be a grave mistake,” Kerry said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Nicole Gaouette in Washington at ngaouette@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: John Walcott at jwalcott9@bloomberg.net",

            "text": "Washington (CNN) -- Russian military exercises near Ukraine are raising concerns that Moscow may be putting troops in position to move across the border if such orders are issued, a senior U.S. official familiar with the most recent administration assessment told CNN Thursday.\n\nBut the United States still believes that Russia doesn't plan to order its forces into its tumultuous neighbor, the official said on the condition of anonymity.\n\nU.S. officials -- who are monitoring the area 24 hours a day -- have not yet seen signs that Russia is preparing to secure supply and transportation routes that would be crucial to any such movement, the official said.\n\nRussian military activity levels observed by the United States also \"appear to be within normal range,\" the official said.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov offered reassurances Thursday to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry that the exercises were previously planned and were not being carried out because of the upheaval in Ukraine, echoing an earlier conversation between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry has said the combat readiness evaluation is being carried out in territory overseen by the western and central military commands. That puts some of the exercises near the Ukraine border.\n\n\"All in all, about 150 thousand military personnel of different services of the armed forces and military commands are involved in the check,\" Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu said in a statement released by the ministry. \"Up to 90 planes, more than 120 helicopters, up to 880 tanks, over 1,200 defense equipment units and about 80 ships will be used.\"\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters Thursday in Brussels, Belgium, where he was meeting with NATO defense ministers, that the United States was following the developments in and around the Ukraine.\n\n\"Until we really know more details -- what's really happening there, who is in charge, I think the focus should be ... let's keep the tensions down. Let's see no provocative actions by anyone, any military,\" he said.\n\nOne concern is that with Russian troops out of their garrisons near Ukraine, they could be in a position to move swiftly across the border -- leaving little time for U.S. officials to try to mount diplomatic efforts to stop them, the official said.\n\nBut, for now, U.S. officials believe Putin is using the hastily ordered exercises only as a message to U.S. and Ukrainian officials that he has the ability to move his military into Ukraine to protect Russian interests if he chooses to, the official said.\n\nRussia has significant interests in Ukraine. Not only does it neighbor Ukraine, the two countries are major trading partners. Many ethnic Russians live in Ukraine's east, and Russia has a major military base at Sevastopol, Ukraine.\n\nRussian officials have complained that opposition figures who have taken control of Ukraine's government are threatening pro-Russian Ukrainians.\n\nThe United States is reviewing Russian tactics in its 2008 move into Georgia for clues about how Moscow might act in this instance.\n\nIn that incident, Russian forces fought troops from Georgia in a brief conflict that followed Russian promises to defend Russian citizens in the restive Georgian province of South Ossetia.\n\nU.S. officials worry about a repeat of that incident, in which both sides perceived provocative actions and Russia finally moved in on a large scale.\n\nAny military intervention by Russia would be a \"grave mistake,\" Kerry warned Wednesday.\n\n\"For a country that has spoken out so frequently in the last year ... against foreign intervention in Libya, Syria, elsewhere, it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of Ukraine,\" he said.\n\nREAD: Ukraine's Crimea lives in Russia's shadow: 5 things to know\n\nCNN's Ingrid Formanek and Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report from Kiev.",

in the capital of ukraines crimea region a tinderbox of ethnic religious and political divisions added an islamic voice on wednesday to the tumultuous struggle for ukraine that last weekend drove the president from power and that has pushed russia and the west into a faceoff reminiscent of the cold war eight hundred miles away president vladimir v putin of russia was ordering a surprise military exercise of ground and air forces on ukraines doorstep on wednesday adding to the tensions with europe and the united states and underscoring his intention to keep the country in moscows orbit continue reading the main story related coverage taken together the two events illustrated the continuing challenges that the new government in kiev faces in calming separatism at home and placating a frustrated russian leader who sees ukraine as a vital part of his strategy of rebuilding russian influence along the lines not of the former soviet union but of the czars while few analysts expected a russian military intervention in ukraine most said mr putin was likely to respond in some fashion to such a stinging geopolitical defeat photo rival protesters clashed in simferopol crimeas regional capital credit sergey ponomarev for the new york times the question was how and on wednesday he provided a first answer when russias military put tens of thousands of troops in western russia on alert at 2 pm for an exercise scheduled to last until march 3 the minister of defense sergei k shoigu also announced unspecified measures to tighten security at the headquarters of russias black sea fleet on the crimean peninsula russian military vehicles have been far more visible in recent days on the streets of crimea residents say suggesting that moscow while probably not gearing up for armed conflict wants to make its presence felt in this potentially volatile region where it has a number of naval and other military facilities dating from the soviet union in a sign of heightened tension road blocks flying russian flags appeared wednesday on the main thoroughfares leading to sevastopol a crimean city dominated economically and politically by the headquarters of the black sea fleet about 25 miles from the city center on the road from simferopol men in blue uniforms and others in green camouflage clothing stopped and inspected all vehicles an armored personnel carrier apparently russian was parked nearby general shoigu announced the snap exercise during a meeting of russias general staff members citing the need to test the russian armed forces readiness to respond to a crisis situation senior defense and government officials later said the exercise was not related to the events in ukraine which officials here have watched with growing alarm but they also said there was no reason to postpone them either and the geopolitical message was clear the orders came as thousands of ethnic russians gathered outside the regional parliament in crimeas capital simferopol to protest the political upheaval in ukraines capital kiev that felled the government of president viktor f yanukovych over the weekend and turned him into a fugitive crimea was russian territory until the soviet union ceded it to the soviet socialist republic of ukraine in 1954 and russians there have already pleaded for the kremlins intervention to protect the region from ukraines new leadership crimea is russian some of the protesters screamed as brawls erupted with rival demonstrations by crimeas ethnic tatars supporting the new interim authorities determined to block the local legislature from heeding calls from prorussia activists for more autonomy and even secession from ukraine 5000 crimean tatars the regions indigenous turkic muslim population traded taunts and occasional blows with protesters waving russian flags after a peaceful start the dueling rallies turned into a melee in the late afternoon a couple of dozen tatars broke into the legislative building surging past riot police officers to confront anxious local legislators huddled inside where are the separatists screamed a furious tatar activist banging a wooden staff on the marble floor the anger of a muslim community known for its peaceful ways and its general lack of interest in radical strains of islam highlighted how the political tumult in kiev has stirred a riptide of conflicting passions throughout a country of 46 million that is now struggling to stay together the military maneuvers were widely seen as saberrattling by a kremlin that has spent a decade or more trying to extinguish separatist sentiments in the north caucasus and elsewhere they nevertheless elicited new warnings from western governments notably the united states which reminded russia of its own admonishments to the west about its military interventions in libya and other nations speaking to a small group of reporters in washington secretary of state john kerry said it was important for the russians to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of ukraine photo president vladimir v putin of russia ordered surprise military exercises on wednesday credit mikhail metzelria novosti via associated press mr kerry did not specify what the united states was prepared to do in response to a russian military intervention focusing instead on what he said the russians would sacrifice i think it would cost them hugely in the world where they are trying to assert a sort of greater legitimacy with respect to their diplomacy he said mr kerry also said the united states was considering a 1 billion package of loan guarantees to ukraine as well as direct aid to the ukrainian government to help address the deepening economic crisis there russia has refused so far to recognize the legitimacy of the new political powers in ukraines parliament and denounced their actions since mr yanukovychs flight as inflammatory and divisive including what the foreign ministry described on wednesday as discrimination toward russian orthodox believers two days earlier prime minister dmitri a medvedev said the turmoil posed a real threat to our interests and to our citizens lives and health i think it is flag waving but its more than that also dmitri trenin the director of the moscow carnegie center said after the announcement of the exercise its a message to kiev not to impose its rule in crimea by force mr putin himself has yet to make public remarks on the crisis in ukraine but senior officials have vowed not to interfere directly and called on the united states and europe to do the same even so the public clamor of ethnic russians in crimea and eastern ukraine has raised fears that russia could be provoked to intervene the home of russias black sea fleet for centuries and embedded deep in russian culture thanks to the works of writers like tolstoy crimea became part of ukraine only in 1954 a transfer that made little difference at the time because both ukraine and russia belonged to the soviet union since ukraines emergence as an independent state in 1991 many of the ethnic russians who make up a majority of crimeas population have nursed dreams of returning to russias fold a goal that has gained a fresh wave of passionate support since mr yanukovychs ouster i dont want to live in a country run by fascists said sergei gaenko a retired law enforcement official echoing a widespread view here that mr yanukovychs ouster was engineered by the political descendants of militant ukrainian nationalists who during world war ii sometimes formed loose tactical alliances with hitlers invading army crimea he added was illegally given to ukraine by nikita khrushchev and he said it was time to correct an historic injustice like many russians here he scorned the new interim government as made up of banderovtsi a derogatory soviet term used to describe followers of stepan bandera a wartime ukrainian nationalist leader vilified by moscow as a pronazi traitor the minority tatars however have little love for moscow after being deported en masse by joseph stalin and now back in their homeland want to carve out their own space inside ukraine we have a long memory of what russia did to us tatars refat chubarov a member of the crimean legislature and a tatar community leader promoscow members of the assembly furious at the cancellation of an extraordinary session they had called to discuss a response to events in the capital accused mr chubarov of using a mob to derail democracy most people on both sides of the russiaukraine divide have no interest in violent confrontation but small militant groups have been increasingly active in trying to rally people for battle in sevastopol crimeas biggest city prorussian groups have been signing up residents for socalled selfdefense units while hardline cossack organizations recalling past campaigns to expand and secure russias borders denounced politicians who call for calm as cowards a small number of militant tatars encouraged by extremists abroad have tried over the years to recruit crimeas muslims for jihad but their efforts have fallen flat any move to restore crimea to russian rule however would risk breathing life into such calls for extremism that among other reasons is why few people even in russia expect to see an intervention such a scenario is impossible

just being delusional the russian black sea fleets main base at sevastopol is far too strategically important in addition ethnic russians make up approximately 60 percent of the population of crimea and most of the population is rabidly prorussian in fact many prominent crimean politicians are already calling for reunification with russia so if you have been thinking that russia is just going to fold up shop and go home now that proeuropean protesters have violently seized power in kiev you can quit holding your breath the truth is that russia is more than willing to fight a war over crimea and considering the fact that vitally important pipelines that pump natural gas from russia to the rest of europe go right through ukraine it is not likely that russia will just willingly hand the rest of ukraine over to the us and the eu either if the us and the eu push too hard in ukraine a major regional war may erupt which could ultimately lead to something much larger russia and ukraine have very deep historical ties most americans may not think that ukraine is very important but the russians consider ukraine to be of the utmost strategic importance as an american how would you feel if another nation funded and organized the violent overthrow of the democraticallyelected canadian government and replaced it with a government that was virulently antiamerican by doing this to ukraine the united states and the eu are essentially sticking a pin in russias eye needless to say russia is extremely angry at this point and they are gearing up for war the following are 12 signs that russia is ready to fight a war over crimea 1 more russian military vehicles continue to pour into crimea just check out this video 2 russian military vehicles have been photographed in the main square of sevastopol 3 russian military jets near the border with ukraine have been put on combat alert 4 russia has ordered surprise military exercises along the ukrainian border 5 in connection with

russia has leased from ukraine since the fall of the soviet union in 1991 the ship is reported to be carrying as many as 200 soldiers and has joined four additional ships carrying an unknown amount of

official has told the financial times that russia is willing to use military force to protect crimea moscow earlier revealed that it would be ready to go for war over the crimea region in order to protect the large population and army installations if ukraine breaks apart it will trigger a war they will lose crimea first because we will go in and protect it just as we did in georgia an unidentified russian official told the financial times 10 officials in sevastopol have installed a russian citizen as mayor of the city 11 approximately 120 prorussian gunmen have seized the crimean parliament building and have raised the russian flag 12 there are rumors that russian authorities have offered protection to ousted ukrainian president viktor yanukovych viktor f yanukovych the ousted president of ukraine declared on thursday that he remained the lawful president of the country and appealed to russia to secure my personal safety from the actions of extremists russian news agencies reported that he had already arrived in russia but officials did not immediately confirm that no matter what the new government in kiev says and no matter how hard the us and the eu push russia will never give up crimea the following is what a recent debka article had to say about the matter there is no way that president vladimir putin will relinquish russian control of the crimean peninsula and its military bases there or more particularly the big black sea naval base at sevastopol this military stronghold is the key to russias middle east policy if it is imperiled so too are russias military posture in syria and its strategic understandings with iran and you know what the people of crimea do not want russia to leave either in fact they overwhelmingly want russia to help defend them against the new government in kiev as you read this militia groups are being formed in crimea to fight back against the nationalist invasion that they are anticipating just check out the following excerpt from a recent time magazine article many of the people at the rally in sevastopol were not just ready to believe they were convinced of the imminent nationalist invasion what scared them most were the rightwing political parties and militant groups that have played a role in ukraines revolution what do you think theyre going to do with all those weapons they seized from police in kiev theyre going to come here and make war said sergei bochenko who identified himself as the commander of a local militia group in sevastopol called the southern russian cossack battalion in

scum running around in kiev with swastikas he said that may be overstating the case nowhere in ukraine has the uprising involved neonazi groups and no swastikas have appeared on the revolutions insignia but every one of the dozen or so people time spoke to in sevastopol was certain that the revolt was run by fascists most likely on the payroll of the us state department and just remember what happened back in 2008 in south ossetia and abkhazia the russians have already shown that they are not afraid to militarily intervene in order to protect russian citizens so what would the us and

government buildings in the strategic crimea region and raised a russian flag over the regional parliament thursday deepening the crisis for the new ukrainian government even as it was being formed

and put fighter jets on patrol along the border respected russian news organization rbk reported that viktor yanukovych who was driven out of kiev by a threemonth protest movement against his government was staying in a kremlin retreat just outside moscow after first staying at a hotel i have to ask russia to ensure my personal safety from extremists the fugitive leader said in a statement

russian officials including president vladimir putins spokesman said they had no information about yanukovychs reported arrival in moscow yanukovychs decision to ditch closer ties to the european union and turn to moscow instead sparked weeks of protests in kiev he fled after riot police attacked protesters in kievs central square killing more than 80 people and european and russian officials intervened he hasnt been seen publicly since saturday when he said he remained the legitimately elected president — a position that has been backed by russia in kiev lawmakers chose arseniy yatsenyuk as the new prime minister he will face the hugely complicated task of restoring stability in a country that is not only deeply divided politically but on the verge of financial collapse the 39yearold served as economy minister foreign minister and parliamentary speaker before yanukovych took office in 2010 and is widely viewed as a technocratic reformer who enjoys the support of the us shortly before the lawmakers chose him as the leader of the new cabinet yatsenyuk said ukraine doesnt want a fight with russia but insisted the country wouldnt accept the secession of the southern crimea region he said crimea has been and will be a part of ukraine the black sea peninsula where a majority of residents are ethnic russians and where russia maintains a naval base has become the latest flashpoint in ukraines political crisis a day after pro and antirussian rallies in the regional capital of simferopol witnesses said gunmen wearing unmarked camouflage uniforms and carrying rocketpropelled grenades sniper rifles and other weapons seized local government buildings and raised the russian flag over the regional parliament they didnt immediately voice any demands and threw a flash grenade in response to a journalists questions they wore black and orange ribbons a russian symbol of the victory in world war ii and put up a sign reading crimea is russia later in the day hundreds of prorussian protesters gathered outside the parliament waving russian flags and signs calling for crimea to join russia oleg slusarenko a protest organizer announced to the crowd that deputies had voted to hold a referendum on expanding crimeas autonomy on may 25 russian news agencies reported that the crimean legislature had held an emergency session — despite the occupation of the building — and removed the local governor replacing him with sergei aksyonov the head of russian unity the main prorussian party on the peninsula it wasnt immediately clear what effect the decisions would have in practice phone calls to the crimean legislature rang unanswered and its website was down oleksandr turchynov who stepped in as ukraines acting president after yanukovychs flight denounced the gunmen who seized control of the government buildings in crimea and warned that any move by russian troops off of their base in crimea will be considered a military aggression i have given orders to the military to use all methods necessary to protect the citizens punish the criminals and to free the buildings he said ukraines ambassador to nato ihor dolhov told the associated press in brussels that turchynov was supposed to go to crimea later thursday russian news agency interfax later reported that he wasnt going in another sign of the ongoing tensions in crimea an ap freelancer saw a convoy of seven armored personnel carriers on a road near the village of ukromnoye about 10 kilometers 6 miles from simferopol the soldiers manning the apcs didnt answer questions and the apcs turned away and headed away from simferopol their nationality wasnt immediately clear in a clear warning to ukraine putin on wednesday ordered major exercises involving most of the military units in western russia as part of the exercises fighter jets were put on combat alert thursday and were patrolling the border russias defense ministry said in a statement it didnt specify the areas where patrol missions were being conducted the military also announced measures to tighten security at the headquarters of russias black sea fleet on the crimean peninsula in southeastern ukraine in brussels us defense secretary chuck hagel urged russia not to take any action on ukraine that might boost tensions after a nato defense minister meeting he told reporters these are times for cool wise leadership on russias side and everyones side nato secretarygeneral anders fogh rasmussen said russian authorities had informed the us alliance of the military exercises and made it clear they have nothing to do with ukraine having said that obviously it doesnt make things easier that there is a coincidence between the timing of this exercise and the ongoing events in ukraine rasmussen said russias foreign ministry voiced concern about the russianspeaking population in ukraine and vowed to protect their interests russia has accused ukraines interim leaders of failing to control radicals who threaten the russiaspeaking population in ukraines east and south which includes the crimean peninsula in simferopol a prorussian activist who identified himself only as maxim said he and other activists had camped overnight outside the local parliament when 5060 heavily armed men wearing flak jackets and carrying rocketpropelled grenade launchers and sniper rifles

everyone on the ground they were asking who we were when we said we stand for the russian language and russia they said dont be afraid were with you then they began to storm the building bringing down the doors he said they didnt look like volunteers or amateurs they were professionals this was clearly a wellorganized operation who are they he added nobody knows in moscow russias foreign ministry said that russia was abiding by an agreement with ukraine that sharply restricts troop movements and added that some unspecified movements of troops had taken place but it didnt violate that deal the interfax news agency reported view gallery antiyanukovych protesters riding on top of an army armored vehicle drive though a street in central in a statement the local government said crimean prime minister anatoly mogilyev had tried to negotiate with the gunmen but was told they were not authorized to negotiate and present demands meanwhile ukraines currency the hryvnia dropped further to a new

fund the finance ministry has pegged the countrys needs at 35 billion dollars for this year and next to pay salaries and debts and cover the large budget deficit it will also have to deal with the angry street protesters who set up camp on kievs independence square also known as maidan during the uprising against yanukovych many of them worry that the new government will not address their grievances including the endemic corruption in ukraines political system hundreds of protesters from the maidan movement gathered outside parliament on thursday placing car tires and unlit molotov

give up crimea without a fight anyone that thinks otherwise is just being delusional the russian black sea fleets main base at sevastopol is far too strategically important in addition ethnic russians make up approximately 60 percent of the population of crimea and most of the population is rabidly prorussian in fact many prominent crimean politicians are already calling for reunification with russia so if you have been thinking that russia is just going to fold up shop and go home now that proeuropean protesters have violently seized power in kiev you can quit holding your breath the truth is that russia is more than willing to fight a war over crimea and considering the fact that vitally important pipelines that pump natural gas from russia to the rest of europe go right through ukraine it is not likely that russia will just willingly hand the rest of ukraine over to the us and the eu either if the us and the eu push too hard in ukraine a major regional war may erupt which could ultimately lead to something much larger russia and ukraine have very deep historical ties most americans may not think that ukraine is very important but the russians consider ukraine to be of the utmost strategic importance as an american how would you feel if another nation funded and organized the violent overthrow of the democraticallyelected canadian government and replaced it with a government that was virulently antiamerican by doing this to ukraine the united states and the eu are essentially sticking a pin in russias eye needless to say russia is extremely angry at this point and they are gearing up for war the following are 12 signs that russia is ready to fight a war over crimea 1 more russian military vehicles continue to pour into crimea just check out this video 2 russian military vehicles have been photographed in the main square of sevastopol 3 russian military jets near the border with ukraine have been put on combat alert 4 russia has ordered surprise military exercises along the ukrainian border 5 in connection with those exercises it is being reported that russia has deployed 150000 troops along the border with ukraine 6 russia already has approximately 26000 troops stationed at their naval base in sevastopol 7 russian ships carrying additional soldiers have been spotted off the coast of crimea russias large landing ship nikolai filchenkov has arrived near the russia black sea fleets base at sevastopol which russia has leased from ukraine since the fall of the soviet union in 1991 the ship is reported to be carrying as many as 200 soldiers and has joined four additional ships carrying an unknown amount of special forces troops flotcom also reported over the weekend that personnel from the 45th airborne special forces unit and additional divisions had been airlifted into anapa a city on russias black sea coastline 8 russian defense minister sergei shoigu made the following statement to reporters on wednesday measures are taken to guarantee the security of our facilities 9 an unidentified russian official has told the financial times that russia is willing to use military force to protect crimea moscow earlier revealed that it would be ready to go for war over the crimea region in order to protect the large population and army installations if ukraine breaks apart it will trigger a war they will lose crimea first because we will go in and protect it just as we did in georgia an unidentified russian official told the financial times 10 officials in sevastopol have installed a russian citizen as mayor of the city 11 approximately 120 prorussian gunmen have seized the crimean parliament building and have raised the russian flag 12 there are rumors that russian authorities have offered protection to ousted ukrainian president viktor yanukovych viktor f yanukovych the ousted president of ukraine declared on thursday that he remained the lawful president of the country and appealed to russia to secure my personal safety from the actions of extremists russian news agencies reported that he had already arrived in russia but officials did not immediately confirm that no matter what the new government in kiev says and no matter how hard the us and the eu push russia will never give up crimea the following is what a recent debka article had to say about the matter there is no way that president vladimir putin will relinquish russian control of the crimean peninsula and its military bases there or more particularly the big black sea naval base at sevastopol this military stronghold is the key to russias middle east policy if it is imperiled so too are russias military posture in syria and its strategic understandings with iran and you know what the people of crimea do not want russia to leave either in fact they overwhelmingly want russia to help defend them against the new government in kiev as you read this militia groups are being formed in crimea to fight back against the nationalist invasion that they are anticipating just check out the following excerpt from a recent time magazine article many of the people at the rally in sevastopol were not just ready to believe they were convinced of the imminent nationalist invasion what scared them most were the rightwing political parties and militant groups that have played a role in ukraines revolution what do you think theyre going to do with all those weapons they seized from police in kiev theyre going to come here and make war said sergei bochenko who identified himself as the commander of a local militia group in sevastopol called the southern russian cossack battalion in preparation he said his group of several hundred men had armed themselves with assault rifles and begun to train for battle theres not a chance in hell were going to accept the rule of that fascist scum running around in kiev with swastikas he said that may be overstating the case nowhere in ukraine has the uprising involved neonazi groups and no swastikas have appeared on the revolutions insignia but every one of the dozen or so people time spoke to in sevastopol was certain that the revolt was run by fascists most likely on the payroll of the us state department and just remember what happened back in 2008 in south ossetia and abkhazia the russians have already shown that they are not afraid to militarily intervene in order to protect russian citizens so what would the us and the eu do if a war erupts between russia and ukraine would they risk a direct military confrontation with russia in order to help ukraine i am very concerned about where all of this could be heading what about you what do you think please feel free to share your thoughts by posting a comment below",

Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov wrote on the Foreign Ministry website about the situation in Ukraine: \"Illegal extremist groups refuse to hand over arms and are practically taking Kiev under their control with the connivance of opposition leaders sitting in the Verkhovna Rada.\"\n\nEuromaidan demonstrations began in Kiev in November 2013 after Yanukovych announced Ukraine would not join the European Union, a move that was seen as bowing to pressure from Russia and thwarting Ukraine's attempt to advance its economy. Protests continued for months despite the freezing temperatures and threat of violence. Protesters at Euromaidan rallies, led by the government opposition parties, also demanded constitutional reform, a more balanced government power structure, and the removal of the president.",

            "text": "UKRAINE President Yanukovych Releases Statement from RUSSIA\n\nSIMFEROPOL, Ukraine — Viktor F. Yanukovych declared on Thursday that he remained the lawful president of Ukraine and appealed to Russia to protect \"my personal safety,\" only hours after masked gunmen seized the regional government buildings in Crimea's capital, barricaded themselves inside and raised the Russian flag.\n\nEven as Ukraine's interior minister appealed for calm and vowed to prevent any escalation of the confrontation in the Crimean capital, Simferopol, Mr. Yanukovych added fuel to what seemed to be the stirrings of a separatist rebellion that could tear Ukraine apart. He warned that the largely Russian regions of Ukraine in the east and in Crimea would \"not accept the anarchy and outright lawlessness\" that has gripped the country.\n\nMr. Yanukovych, in a written statement given to two Russian state news agencies, sounded determined to continue to fight for power, perhaps in a splintered state, five days after he fled Kiev in a helicopter and disappeared from sight. From the Black Sea to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, the developments raised fears that the already wrenching confrontation over Ukraine's future was worsening rather than ending.\n\n\"I continue to consider myself the lawful head of the Ukrainian government, elected on the basis of the free expression of the will of Ukrainian citizens,\" he said in the statement, according to the two news agencies, RIA Novosti and Itar-Tass. \"I cannot be indifferent to the tragic events in my homeland.\"\n\nWhether Mr. Yanukovych can cling to power remains far from clear. Members of his own party have deserted him, and the newly elected members of the Parliament not only impeached him, but also moved on Thursday to approve an interim government ahead of presidential elections in May.\n\nMr. Yanukovych's whereabouts remain a mystery. Russian news agencies reported that he had already arrived in Russia, citing anonymous sources, but officials including President Vladimir V. Putin's spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, did not immediately confirm that.\n\nThe seizure of the government buildings in Crimea raised the specter of a violent confrontation over the status of Crimea and other regions where a majority of residents supported Mr. Yanukovych. In Simferopol, the local police sealed off access to the government buildings that were seized in mysterious overnight raids by what appeared to militant Russian nationals. Crimea has been a source of tension between Ukraine and Russia for decades: the territory was ceded to Ukraine in 1954 and remained part of it when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.\n\nArsen Avakov, Ukraine's acting interior minister, said that the new government was taking unspecified measures \"to counter the extremists actions and prevent an escalation of an armed conflict in the center of the city.\" It was unclear, however, how much authority Mr. Avakov has over the police and other government agencies in Crimea, where a heavily ethnic Russian population views the ouster of Mr. Yanukovych as a fascist coup.\n\n\"Provocateurs are on the march,\" Mr. Avakov added, making his announcement, as he has others, on his Facebook account. \"It's a time for cool heads, the healthy consolidation of forces, and careful action.\"\n\nMr. Yanukovych's remarks were his first since Saturday, when he appeared in a video that apparently was recorded in his political base in eastern Ukraine. Even in his diminished and humiliated position, with journalists and ordinary people traipsing through his presidential palace and sorting through incriminating records, Mr. Yanukovych asserted his authority over the country's armed forces and warned that they should not be called in to quell the apparent rebellion in Simferopol.\n\n\"I, as the actual president, have not allowed the armed forces of Ukraine to interfere in the ongoing internal political events,\" he said, contradicting reports that he had ordered the military to intervene in Kiev, only to have his order rebuffed. \"I continue to order this. In the case that anyone begins to give a similar order to the armed forces and power structures, those orders will be unlawful and criminal.\"\n\nRussia has denounced the political upheaval in Kiev and refused to recognize the new interim government, but officials have also insisted that Russia would not intervene, even as it began a massive military drill on Ukraine's doorstep. Granting sanctuary to Mr. Yanukovych even as he claims to lead Ukraine would nonetheless deepen the confrontation with Europe and the United States.\n\nRussia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine's leaders were bound by an agreement mediated by three European foreign ministers. That agreement, signed last Friday, called for an interim national unity government and new elections, but not until December. Mr. Yanukovych's statement echoed that position, though it appears highly unlikely that the collapse of that agreement could now be reversed.",

            "text": "A NEW era opened in Ukraine yesterday after a day of dramatic twists and turns that saw parliament vote to oust a defiant president and call early elections, and opposition icon Yulia Tymoshenko walk free.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew emphasised that the US, working with other countries including Russia, “stands ready to assist Ukraine as it implements reforms to restore economic stability and seeks to return to a path of democracy and growth”.\n\nAt a G20 gathering in Sydney, the United States and International Monetary Fund offered to assist Ukraine in rebuilding its economy following a threemonth protest movement that dramatically escalated this week with the deaths of nearly 100 people in clashes between demonstrators and security forces.\n\nAnd while life creaked back to normal in central Kiev for anti-Yanukovych protesters occupying the capital’s Independence Square – where curious onlookers paid their respects to those who died under police fire this week – the focus abroad shifted to rebuilding a battered country on the verge of default.\n\nThe whereabouts of President Viktor Yanukovych remained a mystery, after authorities claimed they had prevented the embattled leader from escaping the country and said he may be hiding out in the east, which is broadly pro-Russian and where concerns remain over the potential for unrest.\n\nFears that Ukraine’s debt-laden economy is facing default have sparked panic on markets, with bond yields rising sharply and the hryvnia currency losing a tenth of its value in the span of a few weeks.\n\nA new interim government could be announced in Ukraine, where residents were still reeling from the dizzying changes unleashed over the past week as a mainly peaceful protest movement turned deadly.\n\nThe spiralling crisis prompted Yanukovych to sign a Western-brokered peace deal on Friday with the opposition, which then took over parliament and ushered in huge political changes – including a vote to free Tymoshenko, the fiery 53-year-old hero of the 2004 prodemocracy Orange Revolution.\n\nYanukovych’s arch-nemesis, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in jail for “abuse of power” after his election in 2010.\n\nShortly after the parliament vote on Saturday, she was freed from hospital in the eastern city of Kharkiv where she had been treated under guard, and headed straight to Kiev and Independence Square where she was greeted by an emotional, 50 000-strong crowd. Hailing the end of a “dictatorship”, she said in a tearful voice late in the evening: “You are heroes, you are the best of Ukraine.\n\n“I did not recognise Kiev, the burnt cars, the barricades, the flowers, but it is another Ukraine, the Ukraine of free men,” she said.\n\nHer appearance on the square would have been unthinkable just a few days ago, much like the fate of Yanukovych himself.\n\nOn Saturday, police, parliamentary allies and members of his Regions Party deserted the president one by one.\n\nThe army issued a statement saying it “will in no way become involved in the political conflict” and the police force declared itself in support of “the people” and “rapid change”.\n\nSecurity forces all but abandoned government and presidential buildings and anyone was free to enter unchallenged.\n\nEven Yanukovych’s ostentatious mansion near the capital became a free-forall, city residents gawping in awe and anger at the luxury of a sprawling estate that featured a private zoo and a replica galleon floating on an artificial waterway.\n\nBut still he remained defiant, appearing on television from Kharkiv before reportedly leaving the city, denouncing a “coup” and vowing not to step down.\n\n“I am not leaving the country for anywhere. I do not intend to resign. I am the legitimately elected president,” the 63year-old leader said.\n\nNevertheless, Saturday’s developments appeared to swing the balance of power in Ukraine in the opposition’s favour and seemingly superseded the pact Yanukovych had signed just a day earlier to end the country’s bloodiest conflict since its independence in 1991.\n\n“This is a political knockout for Yanukovych,” charismatic former boxerturned-opposition leader Vitali Klitschko said in a statement. “Yanukovych is no longer president.” Western countries cautiously welcomed the rapid-fire changes taking place in Ukraine – which has been in crisis since November, when Yanukovych ditched a key European Union trade pact in favour of closer ties with Russia.\n\nThe EU, whose envoys from France, Poland and Germany negotiated the peace deal with Yanukovych, said a “lasting solution to the political crisis” needed to be found.\n\n“This must include constitutional reform, the formation of a new inclusive government, and the creation of the conditions for democratic elections,” said EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. — AFP",

secretary of state john kerry saying that any military intervention in ukraine would be a grave mistake for a country that has spoken out so frequently against foreign intervention in libya in syria and elsewhere it would be important for them to heed those warnings as they think about options in the sovereign nation of ukraine kerry said last night putin had earlier instructed his defence minister sergei shoigu to place russias military in a state of high alert for drills in the western military district bordering ukraine the defence ministry denied the drills had anything to do with the political situation in kiev where the government of president viktor yanukovych was in effect toppled at the weekend but the move comes amid increasingly forthright statements from moscow that the rights of ethnic russians in ukraine are being infringed shoigu told a defence ministry meeting that forces must be ready to bomb unfamiliar testing grounds as part of the drill in his blunt message kerry also announced the obama administration was planning 1bn in loan guarantees and additional funding for ukraine but he said that us policy towards ukraine was not aimed at reducing russias

22 2014 supporters of ukrainian president viktor yanukovich have hustled a sweeping law through parliament in an attempt to curb antigovernment protests sparking an outcry from the opposition and raising tensions on the streets the law backed by deputies from yanukovichs regions party and allies also adopted a similar stance to russia on registration of foreign nongovernmental organisations ngos insisting they should pay taxes on profit ngos that were financed from abroad and took part in political activity in ukraine would be categorised as foreign agents it said but the law which ran to more than 100 pages appeared directed mainly at preparing the ground for action to end the street protests that have been taking place in the capital kiev and some other cities since november
