the news about iraq and the insurgents there you know iraq is far from peaceful the insurgents there have never stopped the killing they have never stopped sending insurgents to syria isis is not only operating in iraq but syria as well as we will see the war in syria is far from a civil war the islamic state in iraq and the levant isis is active and well armed they are responsible for countless killings and persecution of christians as well despite the media reports that these rebel factions and others like alnusra and the fsa are fighting only assads army they are systematically cleansing the areas they hold of christians and other religious minorites christians have had a presence in syria since the first century its in reality a home of christianity yet they are systematically being slaughtered and cleansed by the groups that western leaders and turkey saudi arabia and others are backing bbcisis was formed in april 2013 and grew out of alqaedas affiliate organisation in iraq it has since become one of the main jihadist groups fighting government forces in syria the final s in the acronym isis stems from the arabic word alsham this can mean the levant syria or even damascus but in the context of the global jihad it refers to the levant more babylon the babylon of the bible is in iraq and saddam hussein before he died was resurrecting this city declaring himself to be the reincarnation of nebudchenezzer and when obama announced the war in iraq was over and all would be at peace its far from that why mention this as far as bible prophecies go this ties in with what is happening in syria remember the side of islam the sunnis think that damascus plays a huge part in the ushering in of end times and the mahdi while the shiites believe different they both believe that the mahdi wont come until they cleanse the world of unbelievers and it looks like when they say world they are referring to the middle east as the bible did of course their ultimate goal is to rule the entire world known today but in order for the mahdi to come certain things have to happen in the middle east things which they are fighting for today they believe syria is where their gods judgement is coming to pass so you can see what is the true war in syria they want an islamic caliphate with the head in syria and turkey is helping them because they are fighting for the head of this caliphate while iran and hezbollah back assad as they want to become the head of this caliphate in fact the islamists in iran believe that they will hand the black flag of islam to the army that defends the mahdi and destroys israel again revelation unfolding so you can begin to see the back and forth and fighting between shiite and sunni this also brings a picture of the feet of clay mixed with iron that we see in daniel remember the angel tells daniel that the kingdom of the end times will be a mixed kingdom and they will not stand for more on this read here this is very serious its very significant the western leaders led by obama and the us is actually helping this to come about these facts and others are overlooked by most if you look at events and whats really happening you begin to see revelation unfolding look closely at this map as it portrays the land of sunni and shias and you will also see a picture of the divisions of this kingdom and how it is today this is beginning to make its way into main stream media slowly as you saw above in the video this also from haaretz from the first outbreak of the crisis in the southern city of deraa to apocalyptic forecasts of a middle east soaked in blood many combatants on both sides of the conflict say its path was set 1400 years ago in the sayings of the prophet mohammad and his followers more this from front page magazine a lebanese reporter for the almonitor middle east news service explains that iran and hezbollah view the syrian civil war not only in a strategic context but in a prophetic one in their belief the radical sunnis will conquer syria for a short period of time and then iranian forces will intervene on their way to destroying israel more there are many more references to this but follow the above links and become familiar with this as it all ties in with what is happening their beliefs actually mirror our prophecies from revelation revelation 13 is what they believe is happening right now in syria who will win revelation tells us who will win this is very serious and significant this beast is rising and the dragon is giving it its power but back to iraq this is playing right into revelation 16 the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river euphrates and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east how its being reported that the insurgents in iraq have taken control of a dam in the west of the country a dam that ties the euphrates and the tigris in turkey they are adding this as a weapon they say to flood areas and prevent security forces from advancing against them more so before you seek out the sensational headlines of the us as babylon or russia as the antichrist please spend some time looking deep into the headlines of today read revelation again most specifically the chapters relating to the beast kingdoms and mystery babylon seeking guidance and it will unfold for you daniels dreams and visions covered a wide territory remember the persians conquered babylon and their kingdom covered large portions of the middle east from ancient history encyclopedia the exact location of daniels tomb is up for speculation but here is a photo of daniels tomb located in iran from wikipedia its not hard to see why these prophetic utterances from islam resembles ours they are well aware of what the prophets said unfortunately they have twisted them into something that is not recognizable they refuse to see the truth and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables never before have i seen so many of current events pointing to prophecy in centuries before it was a stretch and a twisting of scripture that allowed many to predict things that have not come to pass today we have all the prophecies culminating into one and its beginning to come into focus be a berean find out for yourself the watchmen are sounding the alarm loudly and are running out of time i could site many many scriptures but jesus laid it all out in his olivet discourse even tying it into daniel and noah daniel for the abomination causing desolation and noah for the wickedness of the world matthew 24 and jesus answered and said to them take heed that no one deceives you 5 for many will come in my name saying i am the christ and will deceive many 6 and you will hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you are not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet 7 for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines pestilences and earthquakes in various places 8 all these are the beginning of sorrows 9 then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you and you will be hated by all nations for my names sake 10 and then many will be offended will betray one another and will hate one another 1 1 then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many 12 and because lawlessness will abound the love of many will grow cold 13 but he who endures to the end shall be saved 14 and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations and then the end will come we are seeing every bit of this today take heed that no one deceives you search the scriptures and the current events for yourself you will see a clear picture of tribulation wars and rumors of wars you will see the abomination that causes desolation is here and rising rapidly you will see the wickedness of mankind not only in the western nations but what is happening in the middle east the desolation the slaughtering of innocents and christians has reached unbearable proportions despite what some in the media try to downplay open your eyes wide and really look it will frighten you but remember we know how the story ends we re guaranteed this in scripture and remember how jesus ended his revelation behold i am coming soon my reward is with me and i will give to everyone according to what he has done i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last the beginning and the end blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city outside are the dogs those who practice magic ares the sexually immoral the murderers the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehoods i jesus have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright morning star yes i am coming soon there is much more to this eschatology and what is happening in syria we will be posting more we are currently researching this related insight saudi arabia boosts salafist rivals to al qaeda in syria reuters like this like loading related",

arabia and no government oppressed rebel groups from syria although the article says fighters who crucified these men were from iraq it is saudis who travel to recruit terrorists from other muslim countries bordering syria and bring them to join in the wahhabi battle this is a saudi initiated and lead war therefore the war in syria is being initiated by foreign occupiers now why exactly would they crucify them it means they are kafirs to crucify is a sign of christianity – meaning they are insulting them with this punishment and what exactly is a kafir someone who opposes the wahhabi doctrine of extremism is branded a kafir whether muslim or nonmuslim anyone opposing it fighting against it trying to ban it faces the same persecution and the same civil war pay attention to a few

            "body": "the lone ranger global flash point iraq the crisis and the near civil war – like situation in iraq is fast emerging as another global flash points of 2014 and beyond and this is apparent from the nature of conflict that is unfolding and the kind of brutality that is being perpetrated by the jihadi groups especially the islamic state of iraq and alsham indias interests are likely to be affected by the turn of events in iraq and a strategy needs to be in place in the event of a fullblown civil war and collapse of the state the government in iraq in the postsaddam hussein era has been weak and to make matters worse the sunnishia divide has become more pronounced though the sectarian angle is denied by the iraqi prime minister nourialmalikis spokesman the influence of iran a predominantly shia state over baghdad has unnerved the sunni dominated arab states of the region particularly saudi arabia the rise of isis – islamic state of iraq and alsham or also known as isil – islamic state of iraq and levant whose main objective is to establish a sunniislamist state in the region should be viewed in the context of the internal politics as it obtains in iraq as well as the sectarian divide and mistrust between the sunnis and shias the final s in the acronym isis stems from the arabic word alsham this can mean the levant syria or even damascus but in the context of the global jihad it refers to the levant isis was formed in april 2013 and grew out of alqaeda in iraq aqi it has since been disavowed by alqaeda but become one of the main jihadist groups fighting government forces in syria and is making military gains in iraq the group is led by abu bakr albaghdadi aka abu dua and is considered today to be the worlds most dangerous terrorist the isis came to prominence during the takeover of fallujah in january 2014 and the following month washington recognised isis as a terrorist group nevertheless it has been overtly and covertly been supported by prosunni groups in saudi arabia and other gcc countries the funding of radical groups like jabhat alnusra a group which has direct links with the al qaeda has given the isis more firepower on june 10 the isis captured mosul the second largest city in iraq in a few hours the citys security forces had dropped their weapons and uniforms and fled since then the militants introduced a political charter in mosul and marched south seizing additional towns en route to the capital baghdad isis gained as much as 425 million in cash an unspecified quantity of gold bullion huge amounts of light and heavy weaponry and probably hundreds of new recruits from three main detention centers it has descended — and at an alarming pace — from the northwest of the country and is taking town after town reaching about 60 miles from the capital baghdad such has been the pace of its advancement that by the time the international community took notice and condemned it the isis had made great progress the isis has also taken control of saddam husseins home town tikrit earlier they had taken control of ramadi and samarra—two important towns pm maliki has failed to bring even a semblance of democracy and governance in iraq and there are groups that see the advance of isis as a reply to his misrule the mosul takeover has further weakened baghdads influence in the northern regions this has given the kurds an advantage in its standoff with the maliki government there were reports that the town of tal afar had also fallen to the isis tal afar is strategically significant straddling the main highway from mosul the provincial capital to the syrian border however assuming tal afar has indeed fallen to the militants it does not mean they have a direct link to syria the border crossing at rabia is controlled on the eastern side by iraqi kurdish peshmerga fighters and on the western side by the popular protection units ypg the armed wing of the syrian kurdish democratic union party pyd which is fiercely hostile to isis this offensive has been coming for at least two years after the last american military personnel withdrew from iraq on december 31 2011 the thenislamic state in iraq began its gradual but determined recovery befitting the organizations mantra of baqiya wa tatamadad lasting and expanding the strategy was meticulously planned and carried out in clear stages principally in iraq the isis have spent two years breaking senior leaders out of prison and reestablishing a professional command and control structure expanding operational reach including into syria and exploiting rising sunni discontent with the shiiteled government of iraqi prime minister nuri almaliki thereby encouraging sectarianism isis has substantial roots in mosul where it has managed to remain a potent force during and after the us troop surge this breakaway al qaeda affiliate has been raising substantial sums of money in mosul through an intricate extortion network this reality plus mosuls proximity to isis positions in eastern syria made the city a natural launching ground for this shock offensive in iraq which is ultimately aimed at baghdad besides the isis there are many other armed sunni actors involved in what has become in effect a sunni uprising groups such as the jaysh rijal altariqa al naqshbandia jaish almujahideen jamaat ansar alislam aljaish alislami fil iraq and various tribal military councils isis may be the largest force involved with about 8000 fighters in iraq but its numbers are in sufficient to take and hold multiple urban centers it is still totally reliant on an interdependent relationship with what remains a tacitly sympathetic and facilitating sunni population but this relationship is by no means stable and should not be taken for granted the militants prospects are also dependent on the government and its supporters continuing to advance sectarianism something that encourages sunni actors to accept isis unfortunately this apparent sectarianism has been consolidated in recent days with the iraqi prime ministers call for a volunteer army encouraging the further reconstitution of the asaib ahl alhaq jaish almahdi and the badr brigades three shiite militias active during the us occupation of iraq which appear to be receiving a new boost in recruitment further the call by grand ayatollah ali alsistanis to iraqis to take up arms against isis have increased the perception of sectarianism inside and outside iraq irans role is crucial iran has spent recent years painstakingly trying to consolidate shiite influence in iraq under a central authority in baghdad already the commander of irans external quds force qassem suleimani has been in baghdad and iraqi sources have reported 500 iranian revolutionary guards corps personnel arriving in the capital and allegedly 1500 basij militiamen iranian paramilitary force in diyala saudi arabia has been making all out efforts to thwart the rise of iran and its influence in iraq syria and lebanon always make for useful proxy battlegrounds though a sunni rebellion has little chance of actually toppling the iranianbacked regime in damascus and lebanon is too fragmented for any one regional player to claim a decisive advantage the contest has thus shifted back to mesopotamia where iran can not afford to see its shiite gains slip and where saudi arabia both the government and private citizens has maintained strong ties with many of the sunni tribes in anbar and mosul provinces that have facilitated the sunni uprising all the same there is no love lost between the saudis and the isis in fact the saudis have branded it a terrorist organization and have even uncovered cells of the group on saudi soil plotting against the kingdom thus a variety of factors may have been responsible for the current situation in iraq but primarily the sunnishia divide and a continuing battle for influence fought through proxies between shia iran and the sunni arab states of the region have converted iraq into a war zone and has brought it to the verge of collapse indias immediate concern is the welfare of a sizable number of indians working in iraq according to one estimate as reported in an indian daily about 18000 indians are in iraq with the fall of mosul it has been reported that about 40 construction workers had been abducted by the isis also there are about 46 nurses from kerala have also been stranded at tikrit near mosul the nurses are claiming that they are safe and the indian mission in iraq is trying to evacuate them to safer places india is in the process of sending its former ambassador to iraq suresh reddy to baghdad to try and establish contact with the abducted indian workers suresh reddy who has good contacts in iraq is likely to use his local contacts to trace the abducted indian workers it is anybodys guess as to how the indian government will go about evacuating its citizens who are stranded and secure the release of the abducted workers as as of date india does not seem to have much influence over the warring factions or the wherewithal to secure a safe passage from the embattled region it is virtually impossible to conduct an evacuation exercise on a large scale considering the fighting in various parts of iraq and secondly an evacuation of this magnitude will entail the deployment of armed forces in order to ensure safety of her citizens if india chooses this option then it needs to consider the possibility of an armed confrontation with the isis also an evacuation if planned will necessitate the deployment of indian naval and air assets in and around iraq isis which is being suspected to be behind the abduction of 40 indian workers in mosul has global ambitions and aims to create an islamic world dominion of which even india would be a part a recently released world dominion map by the outfit had parts of northwest india including gujarat shown as part of the islamic state of khorasan a caliphate that the outfit aims to achieve there have been inputs of jihadists from india fighting in both iraq and syria and some of these would eventually return and would then become the link between the middle east outfits and the indian subcontinent that is a time sources said india needs to prepare for the offensive carried out by the isis and its allies bring back memories of the taliban seizing afghanistan which could increase instability in the entire region moreover a crisisridden oil rich country in west asia will adversely impact indias energy needs and the deep economic ties which india has had with iraq at the time of writing this post the sunni extremists have reportedly taken control of most of iraqs largest oil refinery located in baiji in northern iraq the militants have managed to break into the refinery now they are in control of the production units administration building and four watch towers this is 75 per cent of the refinery an official speaking from inside the refinery said",

oil production 2 multiple risksthreats to global oil production 3 north america leads crude oil production gains 4 islamist state of iraq syria – a dangerous threat 5 why isis should worry americans europeans 6 our next webinar on july 23 featuring ycg overview recent reports have confirmed that the us is now the worlds largest producer of crude oil with output exceeding 11 million barrels per day in the 1q of this year this surpasses the daily oil production of russia and saudi arabia this is the first time in over 40 years that the us has once again become the largest producer of oil in the world – and this is despite the obama administrations continued ban on new drilling for oil in our coastal waterways oil extraction is soaring at shale formations in texas and north dakota as companies split rock formations believed to contain oil using highpressure liquids a process known as hydraulic fracturing or fracking this oil boom has dramatically lowered petroleum imports into america the share of us fuel consumption met by imports is down from 60 in 2005 to 33 in 2013 and is expected to fall to 22 in 2015 which would be the lowest since 1970 us passes russia saudi arabia to 1 in oil production us oil production has jumped from 50 million barrels per day in 2008 to 74 million last year and is expected to average 85 million this year and 93 million next year according to the energy information administration the analytical arm of the department of energy if crude oil separated from natural gas is included that figure jumps to 110 million barrels per day this year according to the parisbased international energy agency iea and a new report from bank america corp the united states recently topped russia and saudi arabia in total oil production to become the 1 producer in the world the us became the worlds largest natural gas producer in 2010 this oil boom has significantly lowered americas need for petroleum imports the share of us fuels consumption met by net imports down from 60 in 2005 to 33 in 2013 is expected to fall to 22 in 2015 which would be the lowest since 1970 texas and north dakota now account for almost half of total us oil production according to the energy department which noted that texas monthly oil output recently topped 3 million barrels per day for the first time since 1977 and north dakotas oil production hit a record 1 million bpd the widelyfollowed iea now expects the us to remain the 1 producer of crude oil until at least 2019 when production is expected to peak at 131 million barrels a day and plateau thereafter even so the iea suggests that the us could remain the 1 producer of oil for another decade or longer after 2019 crude oil prices in the us have retreated somewhat since the news on us oil production was announced earlier this month but it remains to be seen if prices will fall significantly below 100 per barrel crude prices have been rising since the first of the year due to various global concerns ranging from russias aggression toward ukraine to the isis terrorist takeover in parts of iraq and syria more on that below multiple risksthreats to global oil production the international energy agency predicts that global oil demand growth will rise next year as the world economy expands and will again be met by rising supplies from the united states and canada however the iea warned in its monthly report last week that risks to oil production in several regions remained acute supply risks in the middle east and north africa not least in iraq and libya remain extraordinarily high oil prices remain historically high and there is no sign of a turning of the tide just yet whether in crude or oil product markets there is little room for complacency north sea brent crude oil hit a ninemonth high above 115 a barrel in june as the isis insurgency swept across northwestern iraq taking control of significant territory and shutting down a large refinery more on this below fortunately most of iraqs oil production and export terminals are located in the southern part of the country the oil market has weakened somewhat over the last few weeks but remains nervous about further supply shocks west texas intermediate crude remains near 100 per barrel while brent crude is still trading near 105 per barrel as this is written north america leads crude oil production gains making its first forecasts for 2015 in its july report the iea which advises major consuming nations on energy policy estimates that global oil demand will grow by 14 million barrels per day next year up from growth of 12 million this year the iea expects newly industrialized and emerging market economies to once again lead the gains in oil demand next year the worlds second largest oil consumer china will see oil demand growing by 42 in 2015 up from 33 this year while the largest oil user the united states will only see gains of 02 to 191 million bpd up from a growth of 06 this year according to the iea the iea said it forecasts nonopec supply growth to average 12 million bpd next year in line with increases in 2013 and 2014 yet north america will remain the leader in 2015 contributing about twothirds of the net nonopec crude oil supply increase increases in us light crude oil mostly from north dakota and texas as well as canadian bitumen are expected to represent well over half of the 2014 nonopec supply growth according to the iea it added that the eagle ford shale boom in south texas will remain one of the most dynamic oil provinces with output growing by 34 to 14 million bpd this year and exceeding 16 million next year the iea reported that while the us and canada remain the mainstays for crude production growth other countries are also making progress – including brazil britain vietnam malaysia norway and columbia among countries which will grow output in 2015 islamist state of iraq syria isis – a dangerous threat isis is a radical jihadist militant group in iraq which has taken control of a large swath of northwestern iraq and parts of syria isis was formed in april 2013 and grew out of alqaeda in iraq and syria it has since been disavowed by alqaeda reportedly due to its ultraviolent and inhumane terrorist tactics isis is led by abu bakr albaghdadi little is known about him but it is believed he was born in samarra north of baghdad in 1971 and joined the insurgency that erupted in iraq soon after the 2003 usled invasion in 2010 he emerged as the leader of alqaeda in iraq isis is fighting to establish a new islamist state caliphate that straddles iraq and syria in june 2014 the economist reported that isis may have up to 6000 fighters in iraq and 3000–5000 in syria the group has seen considerable military success in march 2013 it took over the syrian city of raqqa the first provincial capital to fall under isis control in january 2014 it capitalized on growing tension between iraqs sunni minority and shialed government by taking control of the predominantly sunni city of fallujah in the western province of anbar it also seized large sections of the provincial capital ramadi and has a presence in a number of towns near the turkish and syrian borders isis leaves a path of destroyed churches shrines and even mosques in its wake but why would it destroy mosques georgetown university professor yvonne haddad says isis sees themselves as the last defenders of islamic civilization and want to eradicate anything they see as an enemy of islam and any muslim they perceive as compromising with the west a member of isis reportedly tweeted that their ultimate target is the kaaba sacred house in mecca saudi arabia islams most holy site the tweet reportedly said if allah wills we will kill those who worship stones in mecca and destroy the kaaba people go to mecca to touch the stones not for allah wherever they are in the world muslims are expected to face the kaaba whenever they are praying yet these deadly serious terrorists apparently want to destroy it isis reportedly is planning to take over the city of arar in saudi arabia which is very close to the iraq border from there it is only a 15hour drive to mecca isis is believed to have accumulated up to 2 billion in cash that was taken from banks in cities it now controls and from the sale of oil in addition isis also has a large stockpile of weapons and ammunition taken from iraqs military facilities and elsewhere in the northwest it is widely believed that isis has its sights set on taking control of baghdad iraqs capital with a population of over seven million some analysts feel that isis is not capable of taking control of baghdad due to its size lets hope this is true if isis were to control the iraqi government then it would control the oil and iraq exported apprx 24 million barrels per day in 2013 if those exports are disrupted that could cause an explosion in oil prices stay tuned why isis should worry americans europeans while isis is growing rapidly most analysts agree that its number is still around 10000 fighters and they are located in a relatively small geographic area in northwestern iraq and eastern syria if the us was of a mind to it could take out much of this terrorist group with drones andor targeted air strikes not to worry right yet president obama has refused to take any meaningful action against isis despite the significant threat it poses to the middle east – and ultimately the us never mind that many us soldiers lost their lives liberating these same iraqi cities that isis now controls the worst part is that intelligence experts estimate that isis may have up to 3000–4000 foreign fighters many of whom came from europe and the united states those who carry american passports and could easily return to this country not needing a visa and apply their deadly training here those holding european passports could travel not only to their home countries but also to america without much trouble isis is likely not a threat to countries outside the middle east at the moment as it has its sights on baghdad and gaining control of the iraqi government however unlikely that might be but should isis gain control of iraq and the oil it would have access to vast sums of money and could become a dangerous international threat almost immediately should this happen it would almost certainly have serious implications for the markets so ill stay on top of it as always ycg investments webinar – wednesday july 23 at 200 eastern time on wednesday july 23 at 200 pm eastern time we will be presenting a live webinar featuring brian yacktman and will kruger with ycg investments who will talk about their ycg concentrated composite strategy this strategy leverages brian and wills expertise in investing in stocks that are trading below their intrinsic or true value their stock selection typically includes growing businesses in less cyclical industries that are less capital intensive we all know that the latest hot stocks seem to garner all the attention all the hype often pushes these stocks to trade at 4050 times earnings or more facebook for example trades at over 80 times earnings ycg stays away from stocks like these they focus on value stocks with solid earnings and growth these stocks tend to be less volatile ycg performs a thorough analysis of each company including looking at its product people and most importantly its price they understand that even a great business is a poor investment if purchased at a high price a low purchase price of the right stocks can help create a margin of safety so how has ycgs concentrated composite strategy performed since the programs inception in 2008 it has an annualized return of 170 net of fees and expenses with no losing years you can see more detailed performance information including important disclosures on our fact sheet as always keep in mind that past results are not necessarily indicative of future results with the stock market at a new record high many are wondering if a correction is imminent or if the markets will continue to move higher while we can only speculate where the markets will go next i do know that ycg attempts to find undervalued stocks that are less cyclical with the goal that they will be impacted less when there is a drop in the market this gives you

isis the new al qaeda and face of militant terror june 17 2014 tom olago share this article step aside al qaeda the face and identity of global terrorism now seems to be taking on a new dynamic more powerful and revitalized form named the islamic state in iraq and syria otherwise commonly referred to as the isis isis is reported to be a jihadist group active in iraq and syria formed in april 2013 as an offshoot of alqaeda in iraq aqi it has since been disavowed by alqaeda and considered to be a rival faction but has still become one of the main jihadist groups fighting government forces in syria and is making military gains in iraq the civil war in syria has left a vacuum of authority in large tracts of the country which fueled a resurgence of the isis group as it capitalized fully on syria�s ensuing vulnerabilities the leader and face of the organization is said to be abu bakr albaghdadi believed to have been born in samarra north of baghdad in 1971 a bbccom report states that he later joined the insurgency that erupted in iraq soon after the 2003 usled invasion he then formed his own militant group in the samarra and diyala areas where his family was from before joining al qaeda in iraq in 2010 he emerged as the leader of alqaeda in iraq one of the groups that later became isis abu bakr al baghdadi reportedly graduated to the top job at the age of 39 after abu omar al baghdadi was killed in a joint usiraqi operation baghdadi is regarded as a battlefield commander and tactician which analysts say makes isis more attractive to young jihadists than alqaeda led by ayman alzawahiri an islamic theologian baghdadi is even being referred to now as the �new osama bin laden� not much is known publicly about abu bakr al baghdadi but a biography posted on jihadist websites last year said he held a phd in islamic studies from a university in the capital the iraqi government in january released a photograph of him that depicts an unsmiling bearded figure in a black suit al baghdadi is known to have served four years in a us prison camp for insurgents at bucca in southern iraq during which time he is thought to have developed a network of contacts and honed his ideology he was released in 2009 the washington post says of baghdadi �several facts however are clear baghdadi leads the islamic state of iraq and syria he is a shrewd strategist a prolific fundraiser and a ruthless killer the united states has a 10 million bounty on his head he has thrown off the yoke of alqaeda command and just took his biggest prize yet in mosul an oil hub that sits at the vital intersection of iraq turkey and syria and in just one year of grisly killing he has in all likelihood surpassed even alqaeda leader ayman alzawahiri in international clout and prestige among islamist militants� no wonder then that he has been separately described in various quarters as the world�s �most powerful jihadi leader� �the true heir to osama bin laden� and �the world�s most dangerous man� among other similar titles of notoriety the precise size of the isis organization is unclear but it is thought to include thousands of fighters including many foreign jihadists prof peter neumann of kings college london reportedly estimated that about 80 of western fighters in syria have joined the group isis claims to have fighters from the uk france germany and other european countries as well as the us the arab world and the caucasus in terms of overall clout and potential impact correspondents are quoted as saying that isis appears to be surpassing alqaeda as the worlds most dangerous jihadist group with cnn describing it as �the most dangerous militant group in the world� a senior us counterterrorism official reportedly told cnn this week that isis looks at syria and iraq as one interchangeable battlefield and its ability to shift resources and personnel across the border has measurably strengthened its position in both theaters for western counterterrorism agencies the isis combination of fanaticism and disciplined organization is the nightmare scenario in the words of the soufan group a political risk consultancy isis has become indisputably the most effective and ruthless terrorist organization in the world us counterterrorism officials said isis attacks show the degree to which islamist militants have established a revolving door between iraq and syria with fighters flowing easily between the two countries and fueling conflict in both the obama administration has also expressed concern about the fall of mosul the wall street journal quoted the state department as stating that isis is not only a threat to the stability of iraq but a threat to the entire region as is typical of jihadist groups isis is also strictly sharia islamic law based and has reportedly begun to impose sharia law in the towns it controls examples reported include boys and girls being separated at school and women forced to wear the niqab or full veil in public it however seems clear that professing christians caught up between the fighting are being made to bear the full brunt of the isis attacks christian headlinescom reports that bodies of christian children and their parents litter the chaotic streets of mosul iraq�s secondlargest city as violent muslim extremists have seized a terrorized city iraqi christians once considered their last safe refuge catholic priest najeeb michaeel described the situations as �very critical and even apocalyptic� �most of the inhabitants of the city have already abandoned their houses and fled into the villages�many thousands of armed men from the islamic groups of da�ash have attacked the city of mosul for the last two days they have assassinated adults and children the bodies have been left in the streets and in the houses by the hundreds without pity what we are living and what we have seen over the last two days is horrible and catastrophic�pray for us i�m sorry that i can�t continue they are not far from our convent don�t reply we are now surrounded and threatened with death� and according to nina shea of national review �the population particularly its christian community has much to fear�the ruthlessness of isis an offshoot of alqaida has been legendary its beheadings crucifixions and other atrocities against christians and everyone else who fails to conform to its vision of a caliphate have been on full display earlier this year in syria� the bbc reports about 150000 people have fled mosul population about 18 millionmosul soon will be emptied of christians said a world watch monitor source this could be the last migration of christians from mosul christian families are terrified an elderly woman and her adult daughter reported they were still in their house in mosul they posted on the internet god please save us and mosul and added that only they and one other christian family were left in their neighborhood cnncom and most news agencies and reports seem to agree that isis is trying to establish an islamic caliphate emirate or state stretching across the region straddling syria and sunni areas of iraq the islamic state in iraq and syria has thrived and mutated during the ongoing civil war in syria and in the wake of the security vacuum that followed the final exit of american forces from iraq now isis is seemingly achieving its ominous and forceful expansionist goals with relative ease virtually unchecked isis captured the city falluja 40 miles west of baghdad in january and currently controls large swathes of northern iraq operations in falluja and elsewhere in the western province of anbar were strategically designed to draw iraqi forces away from the north isis is skilled at creating multiple attacks simultaneously in different areas keeping the demoralized iraqi army confused and off balance and with the latest seizure of mosul iraqs secondlargest city and advances on others the isis caliphate kingdom appears within reach isis controls hundreds of square miles where state authority has evaporated it ignores international borders and has a presence all the way from syrias mediterranean coast to south of baghdad although the capture of fallujah was disturbing it was the isis conquest of mosul in june that sent shockwaves around the world the islamist militants took control of sunni muslimdominated mosul after hundreds of its fighters overwhelmed government military forces in a lightening attack on monday forcing up to 500000 people to flee the city and iraqi prime minister nouri almaliki to call a national state of emergency according to the wall street journal osama al nujaifi speaker of iraqi parliament said insurgents had seized not only mosul but the entire province of nineveh where the city of nearly two million people is located what happened in the past few days and what happened today is a complete occupation of the province of nineveh said mr nujaifiwhose brother atheel is governor of the province mosul residents said they were shocked at the ease of the takeover by hundreds of rebels the militants freed up to 1000 inmates from mosuls central prison according to senior police officials they are also in control of mosul airport local television stations and considerable amounts of ussupplied military hardware videos showed victorious insurgents waving black flags emblazoned with islamic script�the standard brandished by al qaeda militants worldwidethe new york times quoted james jeffrey a former united states ambassador to iraq �it�s a shock�it�s extremely serious it�s far more serious than falluja� some analysts expect critical parts of the iraqi oil infrastructure around mosul to be among its future targets despite the extensiveness and ambition of its operations isis is also well financed their revenue streams over time are reported to have included extortion methods such as demanding money from truck drivers and threatening to blow up businesses robbing banks and gold shops was another the strategy appeared to be to use the income to help finance a growing stream of suicide attacks and assassinations calculated to poison the political atmosphere to isis�s advantage it would also finance the recruitment of sunni tribal fighters and spectacular prison raids that liberated hundreds of fighters as well as attacks on police patrols and the assassination of officials now al baghdadi has a new strategy for generating resources largescale attacks aimed at capturing and holding territory ayham kamel of the eurasia group a usbased consultancy says that in the latest iteration of this strategy isis will use cash reserves from mosuls banks military equipment from seized military and police bases and the release of 2500 fighters from local jails to bolster its military and financial capability this has worked perfectly for them so far in seizing mosul isis has suddenly become �the richest terror group ever� after looting 500 billion iraqi dinars the equivalent of 429m �256m from mosuls central bank according to the regional governor jack moore writing for the international business times reported �nineveh governor atheel alnujaifi confirmed kurdish television reports that isis militants had stolen millions from numerous banks across mosul a large quantity of gold bullion is also believed to have been stolen following the siege of the countrys second city the bounty collected by the group has left it richer than alqaeda itself and as wealthy as small nations such as tonga kiribati the marshall islands and the falkland islands� part of isis strategy to maintain popular support is through trying to capture and channel the resentment of the sunni street in both syria and iraq it is reportedly trying to win favor through �dawa� organizing social welfare programs and even recreational activities for children distributing food and fuel to the needy and setting up clinics however its soft underbelly is proving to be its rivalry with al qaeda backed nemesis al nusra which is said to be making common cause with other groups in an antiisis front led by al qaeda�s embattled and embittered ayman alzawahiri and by taking mosul which iraqs kurds see as in their sphere of interest isis may invite greater cooperation between the iraqi army and experienced kurdish fighters meanwhile in the us the political fallout has begun following nine years of usled war at a cost of thousands of lives and billions of dollars the attacks touched off republican criticism of the obama administrations failure to negotiate a security agreement that would have allowed the us to keep troops in the country beyond 2011 pentagon officials said they dont view the attack as a dangerous turning point that requires urgent action rear adm john kirby the defense department press secretary was quoted by the wall street journal as saying but our efforts to help them with counterterrorism is not something that we turn offandon like a light switch�ultimately this is for the iraqi security forces and the iraqi government to deal with� these comments seem to have been demonstrated by recent us reaction to threats within iraq as the threat from sunni militants in western iraq escalated last month prime minister nuri kamal almaliki is reported to have secretly asked the obama administration to consider carrying out airstrikes against extremist staging areas according to iraqi and american officials quoted by the new york times but iraq�s appeals for a military response have so far been rebuffed by the white house which has been reluctant to open a new chapter in a conflict that president obama has insisted was over when the united states withdrew the last of its forces from iraq in 2011 the rising insurgency in iraq seemed likely to add to the foreign policy woes of the obama administration which has recently faced sharp criticism for its swap of five taliban officers for sgt bowe bergdahl and must now answer questions about the death of five americans by friendly fire in afghanistan on monday night critics have long warned that america�s withdrawal of troops from iraq without leaving even a token force invited an insurgent revival the apparent role of the isis in tuesday�s attack helps vindicate those critics among them the former ambassador to syria robert s ford who has called for arming more moderate groups in the syrian conflict of a similar view is kenneth m pollack a former cia analyst and national security council official who reportedly claimed that iraqi officials at the highest level said they had unsuccessfully requested manned and unmanned us airstrikes this year against isis camps in the jazira desert meanwhile apparently sensing that us military help would no longer be forthcoming iraqi prime minister nuri kamal almaliki ordered a state of emergency for the entire country and called on friendly governments for help without mentioning the united states specifically as the sunni insurgents have grown in strength those requests have persisted in a may 11 meeting with american diplomats and gen lloyd j austin iii the head of the central command which oversees american military operations in the middle east mr maliki said he would like the united states to provide iraq with the ability to operate drones but if the united states was not willing to do that mr maliki indicated he was prepared to allow the united states to carry out strikes using warplanes or drones on the local iraqi front some analysts said the scale of the disaster could force a rare agreement among the countrys divided political groupsits potentially driving all factions toward a government of national unity said michael knights an iraq expert and researcher at the washington institute for near east policy if you wanted a wakeup call this is it the rout in mosul was a humiliating defeat for iraq�s security forces led by prime minister maliki and his shiitedominated government and equipped and trained by the united states at a cost of billions of dollars as the new york times put it �the iraqi army apparently crumbled in the face of the militant assault as soldiers dropped their weapons shed their uniforms for civilian clothes and blended in with the fleeing masses� the situation in mosul continued to deteriorate according to residents by nightfall on tuesday 11th june the city was calm but there was no electricity water supplies were running low and there was little fuel to run generators the bodies of militants had been taken away for burial but the corpses of security forces still lay in the streets that�s bad enough news for the middle east but perhaps theodore karasik of the institute for near east and gulf military analysis captures best in the washington post the risk to the global community �isis�s rise at the expense of zawahiri�s movement signals that a new more dangerous hybridbased on state development by wrecking everything in its path is emerging from the syrian terrorist incubatorultimately isis seeks to create an islamic state from where they would launch a global holy war perhaps that war is now beginning as baghdadi�s isis eclipses zawahiri�s alqaeda� it would seem that the ground for the next phase towards annihilating israel and attacking christian and western interests everywhere is being prepared isis appears to be evolving into the perfect global springboard from which jihadists can steal kill and destroy in any place where isis or sharia do not have full control",

zionism nazism facism takfirism its all the same damn thing oh yes and above all made in the usa end isis are thuggish murderers period i have nothing in common with mass murderers just like shiism is also a zionist creation httpwwwthestatecom201407083551948unislamicstateexecutedimamhtml geneva — the islamic states executions of 13 sunni muslim clerics last month in mosul iraqs second largest city were a move by the radical sunni movement to silence moderate voices among iraqs sunnis and they deserve greater attention than theyve received the top united nations expert on religious freedom said here a sunni movement is executing sunni religious leaders that should make us think heiner bielefeldt the uns special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief told mcclatchy its important to focus more attention on these particular killings because here we are not talking about sunnis versus shias this is a very clear case of atrocities committed against their own people against religious leaders from sunni islam who probably have a less simplistic understanding of what islam means the executions are particularly poignant after the appearance friday of the islamic states leader abu bakr al baghdadi leading prayers in mosuls great nurridin mosque one of the first clerics executed in mosul according to the united nations was the imam of that very mosque muhammad al mansuri mansuri was killed june 12 the un said for failing to pledge allegiance to the islamic state a 21minute video the islamic state released saturday showed baghdadi preaching from the same minbar or pulpit that mansuri once occupied twelve other sunni clerics were executed june 14 the un says baghdadi has asserted that all muslims owe allegiance to the islamic caliphate which the islamic state declared june 29 in the areas it controls in syria and iraq and to baghdadi who now calls himself caliph ibrahim bielefeldt a professor of human rights and human rights politics at the university of erlangennurnberg in germany said the purpose of such executions was to silence critics of extreme movements those who oppose the movement he said dont dare to say this publicly because it can be a matter of life and death as for shiism they never fight the zionists for obvious reasons dont take my word for ayatollah kamal hydari has said it attempt will be made to refute ayatollah hydari but we

palestinian resistance movements fighting israeli occupation he also refused to make peace with israel something that 2 sunni led arab countries have done openly and many sunni led arab countries do secretly just yesterday i read an article how the saudi intelligence chief a prince from the royal family wrote an article in an israeli newspaperhaaretz detailing his dreams of flying over to israel

deliberately mistranslate speeches of shia clerics and then take the message out of context throughout the video i didnt hear a shia cleric utter the word zionist suhyooni in arabic once how does some shia marji getting publicity on arabic or persian language western medias translate to the zionist west choosing our maraji do you know that before a shia scholar becomes a marji conferred with the title of ayatollah he needs to study and get the approval seal of two other contemporary maraji how did they manage to interject and place the word zionist ayatollah kamal alhaidary was posing a rhetorical question obviously in a context there are many ahadiths in the books of the sunnis that are called israiliyyat or tales of the israelites which are fictitious stories that crept into the body of sunni hadith literature take note these israiliyyat were not even just hadiths transmitted by jews or ahlulkitab they were hadiths based on fictitious stories or jewish beliefs that crept into your ahadith check what is israiliyyat on the other hand ayatollah haidary is talking of hadiths narrated by ahlulkitab we shia dont cal our hadith books sahih authentic like you sunnis do we are honets enough to accept the fact that an entire book of hadiths can not be sahih and only the holy quran as an entire book is sahih what was the context of the sentence of ayatollah haidary the wahhabis who made that video cut out it is a catastrophe when your intellect is sold to the devil you obviously live your life brainwashing yourself with doctored videos that teach you on how to hate the shia and spread propaganda about their scholars and for people who would dare not fight israeli occupation or defend their sunni palestinian brothers and have submitted their lives i wonder if it truly hurt you for the shia to stand with the west or the zionists your brothers as we type are being torn into pieces in gaza they are using weapons that the shia of iran lebanon and syria have supplied them with to defend themselves where are the saudi and sunni weapons given to your sunni brothers in gaza to defend themselves the shia have been demonized simply because they stood for the palestinian rights and against israeli occupation yet we have fools who would thank the shia by blowing them up in iraq pakistan syria and lebanon and otherwise who would doctor clips to attack shia scholars actually with the enmity and hatred the sunnis have for the shia whether the shia support the palestinians or not why should the shia nations even support the palestinians against israel this is the same israel that was taking in sunni fighters in syrias golan across the border to receive treatment inside israelyet the same hamas that got iranian support and shia weapons to fight occupation ended up backstabbing the shia and went to join the sunni terrorists and alqaeda in syria to fight against the shia groups like hezbollah that are supporting bashar alassads syrian government forces this the below video is what bashar alassad did to then israeli pm while sunni rulers were rushing to kiss his a and for this reason bashar has paid enormously you are an ungrateful

and christians but they become murderers when they start lynching sunnis when you support injustice oppression and bloodshed against others who have different beliefs your injustice will one day come

and usthman were who murdered malik ibn nuwayrah isisstyle who massacred the banu yerbo for refusing to pay zakat to abu bakrs usurped caliphate and declared an entire clan as apostates what is the difference between abu bakr your first caliph and abu bakr albaghdadi the caliph of isis you call murderers i see no difference the only difference is that there was no internet back then to exposing the atrocities of your heroes and many records were banished however not enough was banished to eliminate the truth if you are preaching and a man from your side does not renkiunce his faith but just

are not murdering sunni prisoners these sunni prisoners are murderers who were arrested in antiterrorist operations you quickly convert those you describe as murderers and terrorists when they are

cockburn sunday 13 july 2014 iraq crisis how saudi arabia helped isis take over the north of the country a speech by an exmi6 boss hints that it has been the saudis plan all along how far is saudi arabia complicit in the isis takeover of much of northern iraq and is it stoking an escalating sunnishia conflict across the islamic world some time before 911 prince bandar bin sultan once the powerful saudi ambassador in washington and head of saudi intelligence until a few months ago had a revealing and ominous conversation with the head of the british secret intelligence service mi6 sir richard dearlove prince bandar told him the time is not far off in the middle east richard when it will be literally god help the shia more than a billion sunnis have simply had enough of them the fatal moment predicted by prince bandar may now have come for many shia with saudi arabia playing an important role in bringing it about by supporting the antishia jihad in iraq and syria since the capture of mosul by the islamic state of iraq and the levant isis on 10 june shia women and children have been killed in villages south of kirkuk and shia air force cadets machinegunned and buried in mass graves near tikrit in mosul shia shrines and mosques have been blown up and in the nearby shia turkoman city of tal afar 4000 houses have been taken over by isis fighters as spoils of war simply to be identified as shia or a related sect such as the alawites in sunni rebelheld parts of iraq and syria today has become as dangerous as being a jew was in nazicontrolled parts of europe in 1940 there is no doubt about the accuracy of the quote by prince bandar secretarygeneral of the saudi national security council from 2005 and head of general intelligence between 2012 and 2014 the crucial two years when alqaidatype jihadis took over the sunniarmed opposition in iraq and syria speaking at the royal united services institute last week dearlove who headed mi6 from 1999 to 2004 emphasised the significance of prince bandars words saying that they constituted a chilling comment that i remember very well indeed he does not doubt that substantial and sustained funding from private donors in saudi arabia and qatar to which the authorities may have turned a blind eye has played a central role in the isis surge into sunni areas of iraq he said such things simply do not happen spontaneously this sounds realistic since the tribal and communal leadership in sunni majority provinces is much beholden to saudi and gulf paymasters and would be unlikely to cooperate with isis without their consent dearloves explosive revelation about the prediction of a day of reckoning for the shia by prince bandar and the former head of mi6s view that saudi arabia is involved in the isisled sunni rebellion has attracted surprisingly little attention coverage of dearloves speech focused instead on his main theme that the threat from isis to the west is being exaggerated because unlike bin ladens alqaida it is absorbed in a new conflict that is essentially muslim on muslim unfortunately christians in areas captured by isis are finding this is not true as their churches are desecrated and they are forced to flee a difference between alqaida and isis is that the latter is much better organised if it does attack western targets the results are likely to be devastating the forecast by prince bandar who was at the heart of saudi security policy for more than three decades that the 100 million shia in the middle east face disaster at the hands of the sunni majority will convince many shia that they are the victims of a saudiled campaign to crush them the shia in general are getting very frightened after what happened in northern iraq said an iraqi commentator who did not want his name published shia see the threat as not only military but stemming from the expanded influence over mainstream sunni islam of wahhabism the puritanical and intolerant version of islam espoused by saudi arabia that condemns shia and other islamic sects as nonmuslim apostates and polytheists dearlove says that he has no inside knowledge obtained since he retired as head of mi6 10 years ago to become master of pembroke college in cambridge but drawing on past experience he sees saudi strategic thinking as being shaped by two deepseated beliefs or attitudes first they are convinced that there can be no legitimate or admissible challenge to the islamic purity of their wahhabi credentials as guardians of islams holiest shrines but perhaps more significantly given the deepening sunnishia confrontation the saudi belief that they possess a monopoly of islamic truth leads them to be deeply attracted towards any militancy which can effectively challenge shiadom western governments traditionally play down the connection between saudi arabia and its wahhabist faith on the one hand and jihadism whether of the variety espoused by osama bin laden and alqaida or by abu bakr albaghdadis isis there is nothing conspiratorial or secret about these links 15 out of 19 of the 911 hijackers were saudis as was bin laden and most of the private donors who funded the operation the difference between alqaida and isis can be overstated when bin laden was killed by united states forces in 2011 albaghdadi released a statement eulogising him and isis pledged to launch 100 attacks in revenge for his death but there has always been a second theme to saudi policy towards alqaida type jihadis contradicting prince bandars approach and seeing jihadis as a mortal threat to the kingdom dearlove illustrates this attitude by relating how soon after 911 he visited the saudi capital riyadh with tony blair he remembers the then head of saudi general intelligence literally shouting at me across his office 911 is a mere pinprick on the west in the medium term it is nothing more than a series of personal tragedies what these terrorists want is to destroy the house of saud and remake the middle east in the event saudi arabia adopted both policies encouraging the jihadis as a useful tool of saudi antishia influence abroad but suppressing them at home as a threat to the status quo it is this dual policy that has fallen apart over the last year saudi sympathy for antishia militancy is identified in leaked us official documents the then us secretary of state hillary clinton wrote in december 2009 in a cable released by wikileaks that saudi arabia remains a critical financial support base for alqaida the taliban let lashkaretaiba in pakistan and other terrorist groups she said that in so far as saudi arabia did act against alqaida it was as a domestic threat and not because of its activities abroad this policy may now be changing with the dismissal of prince bandar as head of intelligence this year but the change is very recent still ambivalent and may be too late it was only last week that a saudi prince said he would no longer fund a satellite television station notorious for its antishia bias based in egypt the problem for the saudis is that their attempts since bandar lost his job to create an antimaliki and antiassad sunni constituency which is simultaneously against alqaida and its clones have failed by seeking to weaken maliki and assad in the interest of a more moderate sunni faction saudi arabia and its allies are in practice playing into the hands of isis which is swiftly gaining full control of the sunni opposition in syria and iraq in mosul as happened previously in its syrian capital raqqa potential critics and opponents are disarmed forced to swear allegiance to the new caliphate and killed if they resist the west may have to pay a price for its alliance with saudi arabia and the gulf monarchies which have always found sunni jihadism more attractive than democracy a striking example of double standards by the western powers was the saudibacked suppression of peaceful democratic protests by the shia majority in bahrain in march 2011 some 1500 saudi troops were sent across the causeway to the island kingdom as the demonstrations were ended with great brutality and shia mosques and shrines were destroyed an alibi used by the us and britain is that the sunni alkhalifa royal family in bahrain is pursuing dialogue and reform but this excuse looked thin last week as bahrain expelled a top us diplomat the assistant secretary of state for human rights tom malinowksi for meeting leaders of the main shia opposition party alwifaq mr malinowski tweeted that the bahrain governments action was not about me but about undermining dialogue western powers and their regional allies have largely escaped criticism for their role in reigniting the war in iraq publicly and privately they have blamed the iraqi prime minister nouri almaliki for persecuting and marginalising the sunni minority so provoking them into supporting the isisled revolt there is much truth in this but it is by no means the whole story maliki did enough to enrage the sunni partly because he wanted to frighten shia voters into supporting him in the 30 april election by claiming to be the shia communitys protector against sunni counterrevolution but for all his gargantuan mistakes malikis failings are not the reason why the iraqi state is disintegrating what destabilised iraq from 2011 on was the revolt of the sunni in syria and the takeover of that revolt by jihadis who were often sponsored by donors in saudi arabia qatar kuwait and united arab emirates again and again iraqi politicians warned that by not seeking to close down the civil war in syria western leaders were making it inevitable that the conflict in iraq would restart i guess they just didnt believe us and were fixated on getting rid of president bashar al assad said an iraqi leader in baghdad last week of course us and british politicians and diplomats would argue that they were in no position to bring an end to the syrian conflict but this is misleading by insisting that peace negotiations must be about the departure of assad from power something that was never going to happen since assad held most of the cities in the country and his troops were advancing the us and britain made sure the war would continue the chief beneficiary is isis which over the last two weeks has been mopping up the last opposition to its rule in eastern syria the kurds in the north and the official alqaida representative jabhat alnusra are faltering under the impact of isis forces high in morale and using tanks and artillery captured from the iraqi army it is also without the rest of the world taking notice taking over many of the syrian oil wells that it did not already control saudi arabia has created a frankensteins monster over which it is rapidly losing control the same is true of its allies such as turkey which has been a vital backbase for isis and jabhat alnusra by keeping the 510milelong turkishsyrian border open as kurdishheld border crossings fall to isis turkey will find it has a new neighbour of extraordinary violence and one deeply ungrateful for past favours from the turkish intelligence service as for saudi arabia it may come to regret its support for the sunni revolts in syria and iraq as jihadi social media begins to speak of the house of saud as its next target it is the unnamed head of saudi general intelligence quoted by dearlove after 911 who is turning out to have analysed the potential threat to saudi arabia correctly and not prince bandar which may explain why the latter was sacked earlier this year nor is this the only point on which prince bandar was dangerously mistaken the rise of isis is bad news for the shia of iraq but it is worse news for the sunni whose leadership has been ceded to a pathologically bloodthirsty and intolerant movement a sort of islamic khmer rouge which has no aim but war without end the sunni caliphate rules a large impoverished and isolated area from which people are fleeing several million sunni in and around baghdad are vulnerable to attack and 255 sunni prisoners have already been massacred in the long term isis can not win but its mix of fanaticism and good organisation makes it difficult to dislodge god help the shia said prince bandar but partly thanks to him the shattered sunni communities of iraq and syria may need divine help even more than the shia httpwwwindependentcoukvoicescommentiraqcrisishowsaudiarabiahelpedisistakeoverthenorthofthecountry9602312html 1 like re caliphate declaration your views by crosbreaka 459pm on jul 13 going by the above article which is an eyeopener and after the news today on aljazeera english that boko harams shekau has pledged allegiance to the caliph of isis it is time for the nigerian government to start tracing boko harams saudi wahhabi connections whether the connection is on government level and saudi intelligence or private donors it isnt farfetched at all if they can do it and nurture isis against iraqs shia who are fellow muslims and their mosques they can also do it with boko against nigerias christians and their churches re caliphate declaration your views by vedaxcool m

you raised there first comparing saudi and iranian aid to the palestinians the western countries which are not islamic donate more than what muslim countries donate to the palestinians they send blankets tents and food the iranians send both cash and weapons raw cash and not bags of rice flour or wheat or whatever is the staple food for palestinians your saudi may be sending dates and other food stuffs i really dont have figures to give you what the palestinians need is to free their land and stop being beggars for food the iranians provide the much needed means for them to resist occupation with the hope of freeing their land otherwise israel will continue building settlements and expelling more palestinians from their land the palestinian cause is kept alive through the palestinians being able to maintain their ground and keep their cause alive for freedom at a point when hamas won the election and took contorl of gaza the west and its puppets like saudi cut of aid to hamas controlled gaza the iranian aid wasnt cut off on why the shia powers are close to russia the shia dont believe in civil wars or dividing nations or tearing them apart and then mislabel the destruction as jihad the russianchechnyan conflict is a civil war those so called jihadists backed by the same people backing the terrorists in syria do not represent the chechnyan people they are fighting their so called jihad just as boko haram also imagine the destruction it is carrying out is jihad the russians and chechyans are living side by side and indigenes of their lands the case of chechnya isnt the same as that of palestine the israelis were europeans who left their countries after world war 2 to settle in palestine and evict others the chechnya is autonomous and russian ruled they are an ethnicity in russia if you want to condemn the russian administration then youd have to condemn umar for taking over persia and palestine and having the arabians administer their rule over those lands the main difference between israel and russiaumar is the people are living on their land and are not told to leave or replaced by foreigners as the case with the israeli invasion and occupation of palestine it is not every time an ethnicity wants self rule that you take up arms to fight the central government plunder lives and property and then in the name of islam you want to

personalities on the genocide in burma it will be useful to stick to facts let us deal with the digression first you dont believe in civil wars but sadly your russian friend avidly does otherwise they would not have taken over crimea and now trying to take over eastern ukraine and before then south ossetia and abkhazia russia is also promoting the breakaway of transnistria in moldova i am not sure you ever told anyone to confront russia for causing civil wars in other countries you never even voiced disapproval of the persistent clvil wars that russia instigates so the all the chechens are wahhabis very convenient i know that the wahhabis are the worst specimen that allah has created is that not so all we need to do is label anyone we dislike wahhabi and any injustice done against them will be lawful i am also quite sure that the taiwanese are whhabis just like the biafrans the czech and slovaks who agreed to separate are wahabis it is always difficult to understand why a group invoking the name of religion can be so comfortable with oppression anyway let me tell you the error of your analysis chechens dislike russia palestinians dislike israel hamas believe in armed confrontation shias say they are freedom fighter and all palestine should be supported chechen separatists believe in armed struggle shias say they are terrorists and all chechens are wahhabis see the history of the people you call wahhabis how some people sleep at night is a mystery this is from wikipedia operation lentil began on october 13 1943 when about 120000 men were moved into the republic of chechenoingushetia by the soviet government supposedly for mending bridges on february 23 1944 on red army day the entire population was summoned to local party buildings where they were told they were going to be deported as punishment for their alleged collaboration with the germans some 40 to 50 of the deportees were children 79 unheated and uninsulated freight cars were used the inhabitants rounded up and imprisoned in studebaker trucks and sent to central asia kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan8081 many times resistance was met with slaughter and in one such instance in the aul of haibach about live 700 people were locked in a barn and burned to death by nkvd general gveshiani who was praised for this and promised a medal by lavrentiy beria many people from remote villages were executed per berias verbal order that any chechen or ingush deemed untransportable should be liquidated on the spot recognition of genocide forced deportation constitutes an act of genocide according to the iv hague convention of 1907 and the convention on the prevention and repression of the crime of genocide of the un general assembly adopted in 1948 and in this case this was acknowledged by the european parliament as an act of genocide in 2004 ethnic tensions when the chechens and ingush returned to their homeland they found other peoples living quite literally in their houses and on their land unsurprisingly the returnees viewed the other ethnicities ossetes russians laks kumyks and avars that had been moved onto the lands that had been theirs before with hostility the goal of this and indeed adding shelkovskaya and naursky to chechenoingushetia was to try to forcefully assimilate the chechens by keeping them away from the mountains and reminders of their ancient struggles and to keep them mixed in with supposedly more loyal russians so they could not rebel without a counterforce present do i support biafra muslims are supposed to fight oppression why would i not support biafra if they are oppressed nobody has the right to oppress another allah forbids that there is enough on earth to go round people are just selfish if you run a very good system people will embrace you and want to be part of you there is no compulsion in religion why should there be in nationality read the story of aral sea it is a geographical disaster the result of the policy of russia the people whose environment and means of livelihood are destroyed would be justified in bailing out of russia would they not chechen mercenaries are mercenaries just like iranian mercenaries will be mercenaries or are all iranians now illegal migrants given that two iranians with forged documents in that malaysian plan are we going to criminalise every chechen because of that my question is this when somebody spoke about the massacre of muslims in srebrenica here on nl shias asked him to shut up what was the offence of the muslims massacred in srebrenica that we can not talk about it but if i talk about the toppling of musseqique of iran i am a good man my point shias are moved by politics not islamic brotherhood you are the allies of people who are systematically trying to erase the identity of the chechens and you justify with lies in ramadan and you ally with communists may allah give us guidance but you need to rethink your ideas i will not use google to waste my time if shias support muslims elsewhere let us know re caliphate declaration your views by lagosshia 704pm on jul 16 tbaba1234 turkey is the only muslim country with superior military strength to israel according

or independent and decides to use its strength in support of the oppressed palestinian people that is when the superior military strength will evaporate like hot air so the strength you are boasting

and islamic ideology aims at setting up a new state stretching across the syriairaq border the isis has already caught the imagination across the sunni world especially among young sunni men in bordering countries but the bigger impact of such act will be seen in coming days reaction the current crisis in iraq is the result of a bigger shiasunni rivalry and conflict in west asian region which has always affected the world order before the commencement of arab spring it was sunnishia sectarian rivalry that preoccupied most political analysts of the middle east indeed arab spring brought about some changes but now it is a new situation where sunnis are feeling the threat of growing shia dominance in the region thus the growing tensions and occasional clashes between the two main strands of islam have been major concerns in fact the syria situation has emerged into a new battleground outside syria with secret back up and deep pockets isis militants have seized control of every major border crossing from syria into iraqas well as four critical towns in iraqs western province the group now controls large areas of both countries and there are concerns that the iraqi government could collapse if this trend continues the manner in which isis is operating is nothing short of a trained military having advanced weapons armored vehicles and with planned strategy they are able to capture maximum cities within a short span of 10 days which itself is an indication of the focused motive of this group now with isis militantspredominantly supporter of sunni are creating havoc in iraq after devastating syria initially the group relied on donations from wealthy individuals in gulf arab states particularly kuwait and saudi arabia who supported its fight against president bashar alassad but now the group has been operating independently of other jihadist groups in syria such as the alnusra front the official al qaeda affiliate in the country and has had a tense relationship with other rebels after arab spring the growing influence of iran a shia state was a major concern for gulf countries especially to saudi arabia to counter irans influence and closer ties between iran and syria gulf countries started funding few rebel groups and now with their guidance isis is capitalizing on growing tension between iraqs sunni minority and shialed government while the instability in iraq has connections to the syrian conflict next door and many individuals who fought for isis in syria are now present in iraq the iraqi insurgency is more acutely focused on solving the problems of iraqs fractured polity than it is the goals of more radical islamic groups as the iraqi people are not very content with the rule of iraqi prime minister nouri maliki insurgents and few sunni tribal sects of iraq believe that maliki has got into some secret agreement with shias to remain in power which is not acceptable by the people of the country the people of iraq who are now even supporting the isis militants are expecting a political reform the stunning speed with which a few thousand lightly armed isis fighters have seized control of large portions of the country in the past two weeks has raised fears that the entire state of iraq could soon collapse the rapid advance from isis does have certain regional implications the neighboring countries of iraq syria iran turkey and saudi arabiamay face the heat of this revolution however isis advancement towards saudi arabia is less likely as it is one of the biggest donors for this group there were reports that isis has already taken few turkish as hostage as saudi and other gulf countries have sponsored the isis group in the past the threat looms on them as well but as it is well known that how these countries have so far played such games of sponsoring regional terrorism it will be no surprise if after conquering iraq the isis moves on to its next targets like lebanon israel or other countries the current iraq crisis is also posing a serious challenge for united states as to how to formulate a suitable foreign policy for the region where it is fast losing its influence further there are possibilities that few pakistani militants are also involved in either training isis rebels upon the request from saudi or directly fighting among the group as rebels there is no denial that pakistan has taken a keen interest in shiasunni conflict affecting the whole middle east therefore india also needs to keep a vigil along its western borders and should carefully observe how the situation is unfolding in iraq for isis which is fast gaining all the publicity and support from various groups and countries it will be difficult to stop them once they have tasted the power and for gulf countries like saudi arabia qatar and kuwait isis has become like a genie either you give them next country to fight or you become their target",

its unrecognized selfproclaimed status as an independent state it claims the territory of iraq and syria with implied future claims intended over more of the levant including lebanon israel jordan cyprus and southern turkey they are also known by two other names islamic state of iraq and the levant and islamic state in iraq and alsham what is the levant levant consists of the island of cyprus israel jordan lebanonsyria palestine and part of southern turkey the modern history of the levant in 1514 selim the grim began the systematic ottoman conquest of the region syria was occupied in 1516 and egypt in 1517 extinguishing the mameluk line iraq was conquered almost in 40 years from safavids were successors of aq qoyunlu the ottomans united the whole region under one ruler for the first time since the reign of the abbasid caliphs of the 10th century and they kept control of it for 400 years the ottoman empires was one of the greatest most extensive and long lasting in the history of the world it included most of the territories of the eastern roman empire and held portions that the byzantines never ruled the ottoman empire was born in 1300 and endured until world war i sykespicot agreement the sykes–picot agreement officially known as the asia minor agreement was a secret agreement between the governments of the united kingdom and france with the assent of russia defining their proposed spheres of influence and control in the middle east should they succeed in defeating the ottoman empire during world war i the negotiation of the treaty occurred between november 1915 and march 1916 the agreement was concluded on 16 may 1916 the agreement effectively divided the arab provinces of the ottoman empire outside the arabian peninsula into areas of future british and french control or influence the terms were negotiated by the french diplomat françois georgespicot and british sir mark sykes the agreement is seen by many as a turning point in western–arab relations it did negate the promises made to arabs through colonel t e lawrence for a national arab homeland in the area of greater syria in exchange for their siding with british forces against the ottoman empire almost 100 years later 2014 the jihadist organization isis uses sykespicot as their rallying cry and have conquered mosul and parts of northern syria to form an arab caliphate along sectarian lines rather than definitions of european diplomats how did isis form isis was formed in april 2013 and grew out of alqaeda in iraq aqi it has since been disavowed by alqaeda but become one of the main jihadist groups fighting government forces in syria with the al nusra front and free syrian army and is making military gains in iraq the organisation is led by abu bakr albaghdadi little is known about him but it is believed he was born in samarra north of baghdad in 1971 and joined the insurgency that erupted in iraq soon after the 2003 usled invasion who is their leader abu bakr albaghdadi he was held at a us detention camp camp bucca in iraq after the invasion a twitter account wikibaghdady has leaked biographical details that followed fit with the available record and have been confirmed by subsequent reports on baghdadi—that his real name is ibrahim awwad ibrahim bou badri bin armoush and he was born not in baghdad but samarra he has a phd in islamic studies from the islamic university of baghdad what is isis trying to accomplish they are trying to reestablish a caliphate this is a graphical representation of the territory isis is trying to control why are they having so much success 1 money isis received a huge injection of cash when it captured the northern iraqi city of mosul reports say during the invasion isis reportedly secured more than 466 million and a large quantity of gold bullion when it broke into mosuls central bank since then the organization has continued to loot and pillage everything in its path adding to its already considerable wealth isis has also become increasingly wellarmed as it appropriates military weapons and equipment left behind after the united states pulled out of iraq in 2009 source oil fields in iraq and syria roadblocks with forced donations extortion of businesses in iraq and syria wealthy gulf donorsquasi state actors deviation of funds from charities as many support syria charities are rather dubious entities tariffs at the bordercrossings they control 2 weapons from seizing cities many of these weapons were sold to the government and originate from the united states 4 saddam husseins former general izzat ibrahim aldouri the most significant charge wikibaghdady made—and the one that now seems most prophetic after the group took control of mosul iraqs secondbiggest city—is that isiss inner chamber of power hidden by baghdadis public front is led by a former baathist and colonel in saddams army called haji bakr according to wikibaghdady it was bakr who engineered baghdadis rise to power after isiss former leader abu omar albaghdadi was killed in 2010 by a joint usiraqi operation in tikrit that baathist connection resurfaced last week after isis iraq offensive and has proven to be a critical aspect of the groups strategy and a cornerstone of its current ability to take and hold ground last week on june 13 the wikibaghdadi account claimed a meeting between isis and naqshbandi army near alqayara area south of mosul had taken place with representatives from izzat ibrahim aldouri and baghdadi izzat ibrahim aldouri is a mythic figure among many of iraqs sunnis a highranking commander in the iraqi army before the american invasion aldouri became the leader of iraqs banned baath party after hussein was executed in 2007 he managed to evade capture by american and iraqi forces and has been in hiding pretty much since then since his disappearance sightings of aldouri have been reported in mosul but he has never resurfaced publicly now aldouri appears to have resurfaced leading the the naqshbandi army the former baathist officers who form a cornerstone of the sunni coalition in mosul that includes isis after aldouris hiding out for years in mosul cultivating the underground sunni insurgent force reports about aldouri suddenly started popping up in the last week despite the rhetoric about the isis takeover of iraq its clear that the groups rapid advance owed much to its alliance with other sunni groups including the baathist naqshbandis led by aldouri source 5 the shiasunni split there is definitely an emerging struggle between sunni and shia to define not only the pattern of local politics but also the relationship between the islamic world and the west daniel brumberg of georgetown university author of reinventing khomeini the struggle for reform in iran the original split between sunnis and shiites occurred soon after the death of the prophet muhammad in the year 632 there was a dispute in the community of muslims in presentday saudi arabia over the question of succession who was the rightful successor to muhammad most of the prophet muhammads followers wanted the community of muslims to determine who would succeed him a smaller group thought that someone from his family should take up his mantle they favored ali who was married to muhammads daughter fatimah shia believed that leadership should stay within the family of the prophet they were the followers of ali his cousin and soninlaw sunnis believed that leadership should fall to the person who was deemed by the elite of the community to be best able to lead the community the sunnis prevailed and chose a successor to be the first caliph eventually ali was chosen as the fourth caliph but not before violent conflict broke out two of the earliest caliphs were murdered war erupted when ali became caliph and he too was killed in fighting in the year 661 near the town of kufa now in presentday iraq the violence and war split the small community of muslims into two branches that would never reunite the war continued with alis son hussein leading the shiites hussein rejected the rule of the caliph at the time says vali nasr author of the shia revival he stood up to the caliphs very large army on the battlefield he and 72 members of his family and companions fought against a very large arab army of the caliph they were all massacred hussein was decapitated and his head carried in tribute to the sunni caliph in damascus his body was left on the battlefield at karbala later it was buried there if isis succeeds in reaching the shia holy cities of karbala and najaf isis has vowed to destroy the shia shrines in those cities and threatens a genocidal campaign against all shias such a move could inspire sunni militants to attack shias everywhere while forcing shia militants to take revenge on sunnis across the globe there is little the vast majority of peaceful muslims around the world would be able to do an audio statement by abu mohammed aladnani of isis last weekend is a call for the mass killing of shias we need to settle our differences with you his statement read these differences go back a long way we will settle our differences not in samarra or baghdad but in karbala the filthridden city and in najaf the city of polytheism sunni emphasis in iraq sunni arabs seems themselves as a marginalized minority unfairly targeted and uninvolved in the political process isis has branded itself as the sunni savior in iraq the sunni people are even welcoming them in many areas of iraq currently iraqi government atrocities the failure of iraqi leaders including prime minister nouri almaliki to build an inclusive political system has enabled the current startling advances of militants across iraq led by the islamic state of iraq and alsham or isis source five killed 23 wounded as iraqi army opens fire on antigovt protest iraqi prime minister killing sunnis to get shiite votes sunni civilians run over by iraqi army vehicle warning graphic some sunni prisoners executed by the iraqi army warning graphic what would life under an isis caliphate look like yesterday a member of isis abubakraljanab took the time to let me interview him via twitter here is our conversation response from a different isis member aburashashisis as you can see there are some different schools of thought regarding the application of sharia law to nonmuslims everyone stopped the conversation when i asked them to define government i have messaged each of them several more times today asking them to either define government or explain its necessity for the creation of the isis caliphate ive yet to get a response the caliphate governing structure would be comprised of 4 parts 1 caliph khaleefah is the head of state in the khilafah he is not a king or dictator but an elected leader whose authority to rule must be given willingly by the muslims through a special ruling contact called baya without this baya he can not be the head of state this is completely opposite to a king or dictator who imposes his authority through coercion and force the tyrant kings and dictators in the muslim world are ample examples of this imprisoning and torturing the muslims and stealing their wealth and resources this contract of baya stipulates that the khaleefah must be just and rule the people by sharia he is not sovereign and can not legislate laws from his own mind that suit his personal and family interests any legislation he wishes to pass must be derived from the islamic legal sources through a precise and detailed methodology called ijtihad 2 unjust acts court if the khaleefah legislates any law contrary to this or commits oppression against his people the court can impeach the khaleefah and order his removal from office 3 enforcement agency this agency would be responsible for carrying out the penalties issued by the court 4 military why does isis believe a new caliphate is necessary from the quran allah swt says in the translation of the meaning of the quran ulkareem tmq 1 but no by your lord they will not have eeman until they make you o prophet rule between them in that wich they dispute and they find in their souls no resistance against your decisions but accept them with the fullest conviction tmq 465 2 indeed we have revealed to you the book with the truth so that you may rule between mankind by that which allah has shown youtmq 4105 3 so rule between them by that which allah has revealed and follow not their desires but beware of them in case they seduce you from just some part of that which allah has revealed to you tmq 449 4 whosoever does not rule by that which allah has revealed they are disbelievers kafiroonthe thaalimoon oppressorsthe fasiqoon evil doers tmq 4 54447 these ayaat verses of quran and many others prove beyond doubt the obligation of ruling by what allah has revealed the first one in particular refers to the muslims directly by stating that we have no real imaan belief until we make them judge between us by allahs revelation this is an indication of the obligation for all muslims to establish allahs ruling system source how does isis justify the gruesome manner in which they act isis feels that sunnis have been victimized in iraq their families and religious brothers have been killed they view each act as retribution in accordance with sharia law in addition the gruesome images below are used as evidence of their success to recruit new members isis hauling away a group of shiite men isis executing a group of shiite men isis makes their victims dig their own graves before executing them a public crucifixion by isis so the question that remains is what is the proper libertarian response to isis the libertarian position is one of nonintervention therefore libertarians would say that the situation in iraq is not of our concern until it directly effects us and threatens our security libertarians can only hope that individuals in iraq will stand up to tyranny and claim their natural right of selfgovernance however i am torn the situation in iraq exists because of outside intervention from other governments do i as a libertarian have any responsibility no do i as a human being who believes each individual should be able to live in total freedom of tyranny feel responsible of course but that is not possible in iraq some organization will ultimately end up ruling that land however i can not help but think at a bare minimum i should offer safe harbor to those who wish to flee iraq intervention at this point will clearly do more harm than good for those who wish to selfgovern as the old saying goes the path to hell is paved with good intentions at what point is intervention allowable in iraq only when an expansionist caliphate threatens my personal freedoms within the libertarian framework are preemptive measure explicitly prohibited even if it is a certainty your freedoms will be threatened in time i wish i had the answer because i am still wrestling with these thoughts i engaged members of isis on social media because i felt the best way i could contribute was to engage them in a discussion about the necessity of forming a government in order to implement their vision if isis gave inhabitants of iraq the choice of joining their organization and voluntarily submitting to their laws i would not feel intervention is necessary however i doubt a single isis member has given thought as to whether offering individuals the choice of joining isis would be more in accordance with the values of islam the word islam means voluntary submission to god how can a caliphate government be voluntary by forcing the inhabitants in iraq to live under the caliphate isnt isis robbing each individual of their ability to voluntarily submit to god a caliphate is contrary to the central tenet of islam if an individual has no choice in becoming a citizen of isis how can they voluntarily submit to gods will as frank s meyer said acceptance of the moral authority derived from transcendent criteria of truth and good must be voluntary if it is to have meaning if it is coerced byforceit is meaningless government caused the horrific atrocities sunnis have encountered for thousands of years does isis really believe the solution to the problem caused by government is government muhammad was a community organizer not a government leader sure he authored the constitution of medina but only so warring tribes could live together in peace the constitution of medina rights for those who consented and a system of settling disputes did it form a government nothing like a caliphate it was a voluntary social contract those who chose not to accept the contract were neither subject to it nor protected by it isis should follow the example set by muhammad offer individuals living in iraq the opportunity to voluntarily become a member of the islamic state of iraq and alsham the solution is for isis shiites kurds and all inhabitants of iraq to commit to a ceasefire and call a constitutional convention collectively draft an iraqi constitution like the one muhammad drafted in medina so long ago do it with the his same sentiment to find a way to live together in harmony isis learn from the example set by your prophet comments comments",

in tikrit by adrian lee daily mail published sat june 21 2014 when the gunmen arrived in town one of their first tasks was to raid shops and confiscate every carton of cigarettes the tobacco was loaded on to a truck and was soon burning on a giant pyre under the watchful eyes of the fanatics for residents in raqqa near the border with iraq in northern syria this display of power was just a taste of life to come under isis within days the radical muslim group that is bulldozing through the region had decreed that women could not raise their voices in public or walk at a late hour without a male chaperone from elsewhere have come horrific stories of brutality including the alleged filming of mass executions now this group controls half of iraq and is knocking on the door of the capital baghdad led by a man who has been described as the new osama bin laden the aim of isis is a new muslim state straddling syria and iraq which is to be run under ultrastrict sharia law for anyone stepping out of line the punishments are harsh isis believes in crucifixion and the amputation of limbs for criminal acts its claimed that to set an example the heads of their dead enemies are boiled in oil it is a return to the dark ages last witnessed when the taliban joylessly governed afghanistan as the west dithers apparently taken by surprise by the speed of the invasion the iraqi government has likened the rule of isis in vast swathes of the country to the nazi occupation of europe and pleaded for help and our prime minister david cameron is warning that we should not dismiss isis as a foreign problem because the terror group is planning attacks in britain the ranks of isis are being swollen by impressionable young men from overseas including britons who are attracted by its religious ambition this week one of the britons calling himself abu rashash britani sent messages from the front line calling for cameron to be beheaded he also urged his muslim brothers in the uk to take to the streets isis believes muslim women should be fully covered up in public its only recently that isis which stands for islamic state of iraq and the levant has sprung to prominence the

uses a series of other aliases earned a doctorate from the university of baghdad and is said to be an avid reader of poetry he became radicalised and was held prisoner by us forces from 2005 to 2009 according to us sources when he was released from camp bucca in iraq he remarked ill see you guys in new york he has earned a reputation as an astute leader who has exploited unrest between rival muslim groups and positioned isis as an even more radical alternative to al qaeda listed as a terrorist by the united nations in 2011 he has a £6million bounty on his head baghdadi keeps a low profile and when addressing his men is said to wear a mask to obscure his identity resulting in the nicknames the invisible sheikh and the ghost a sunni muslim he has extreme views about how people should live and when a town is liberated by isis forces sharia law is immediately declared women are encouraged to stay indoors most of the time supposedly for the stability of the home but when venturing out must wear full islamic dress including a veil and gloves leader abu bakr albaghdadi singing and dancing are banned along with alcohol cigarettes and the popular hookah pipe songs and music are forbidden in islam as they prevent one from the remembrance of god and the koran and are a temptation and corruption of the heart according to a statement issued by isis every smoker should be aware that with every cigarette he smokes in a state of trance and vanity he is disobeying god shop owners are forbidden from displaying images of people in their windows and ordered to close 10 minutes before prayer time its also considered a sin to build elaborate tombstones under islamic law death is final and resting places should be unadorned when prayers begin every man should attend a mosque

publishes an annual report to boost fundraising in which it publishes details of its atrocities the latest edition of alnaba the news boasts of 1000 assassinations planting more than 4000 roadside bombs and freeing hundreds of prisoners the march of isis began in syria but it was the capture of mosul iraqs second city with a population of two million people which sent shock waves through the region despite vastly outnumbering isis the iraqi army appears to have crumbled in the face of the onslaught which began only on june 9 and the invaders are now targeting the capital burning a mountain of cigarettes which are outlawed for being a distraction from god one former us commander said when a force like that gets momentum and the security forces start to crumble it becomes difficult to stop worryingly isis appears to be well organised and awash with cash following the looting of banks in towns and cities seized along the way the group reportedly took hundreds of millions of dollars from mosuls branch of iraqs central bank according to some financial experts isis is already the richest terror organisation in the world with a £11billion fortune isis is said to earn significant amounts from the oilfields it controls in eastern syria reportedly selling some of the supply back to the syrian government it is now locked in battles for iraqs major oilfields isis which has also captured iraqi military equipment a handful of helicopters and vehicles is believed to have been selling looted antiquities from historical sites money also pours in from sympathisers

            "body": "guardian news website iraq boils how us and the world stand there was a scenario that raised the eyebrows of watchers of the international scene sometime in 1990 an iranianborn journalist with londons observer newspaper farzad bazoft was hanged in baghdad after being accused of spying on a military installation a combination of events then led to the invasion of oil rich kuwait by the sadam husseinled regime same year as the sending of bazoft to the gallows was still causing consternation in many quarters outside the comfort of baghdad the response from the west presented itself as the first gulf war a massive united states us led military campaign that forced iraq to withdraw in february 1991 then the west returned in 2003 to finish where it left off with a controversyridden mandate to rid iraq of weapons of mass destruction wmd and to set the people of iraq free following the occupation of its land iraq was subjected to a united nations un supervised weapons inspection programme but the protracted rebellion in the land of old babylon has meant that iraq has known no real peace even after the demise of the maximum ruler sadam hussain today there is a local war going on in iraq the insurgents spearheaded by islamists fighting under the banner of the islamic state of iraq and the levant isis have overrun much of north and west iraq including the secondbiggest city mosul and according to a united nations un team the violence has claimed at least 1075 lives most of them civilians in iraq this month alone the global body said the figures which include a number of verified summary executions should be viewed as an absolute minimum so last week the us once again decided to send close to 300 troops to iraq after a withdrawal had been effected with so much ado there is so much happening now in that country on a daily basis as a symptom of the fascist state that iraq had gradually become since the 1980 when the bitter war was fought with neighbour iran with western backing what the us wants now now what does the us move portend in a world grappling with the massive devastation taking place in syria and tension over ukraine with all of the african flash points can the world handle another carnage in iraq again the american government has put it out that the first batch of the troops being sent to iraq now is meant to assist the iraqi army in combating a growing sunni militant insurgency the pentagon in a statement maintained that they have already begun work but specifically the barrack obama administration has clarified that the troops are not intended as operational forces but instead are there to advise the iraqis and provide intelligence what the world is being made to understand is that the iraqi government had requested american air strikes but understandably president obama has been reluctant to do anything that could lead to accusations the us was taking sides in what ordinarily should be seen as a sectarian conflict in an interview last tuesday with the british broadcasting organisation bbc us secretary of state john kerry called for a political strategy and for regional cooperation to resolve iraqs unrest every country in the region will combine in order to take on and expel isis because it is simply unacceptable to have a terrorist organisation grabbing territory and challenging the legitimacy of governments he said according to him the kurdish leaders had agreed there was no military solution but called for a political solution that deals with empowering the people in the communities where isis is todayjust a strike alone is not going to change the outcome you need to have a fullfledged strategy which is principally a political strategy kerry it is understood has been talking to kurdish leaders in the northern city of irbil where the rebels continue to advance and are fighting to take a key oil refinery the kurdish regions president massoud barzani had before last week strongly suggested that it would seek formal independence from the rest of iraq issues that wont go away on the surface it is a local war of tribes and sects squaring up against each other trying to gain more influence and even political space but iraqi prime minister nouri maliki a member of iraqs shia muslim majority has been criticised for concentrating power among his mostly shia allies and excluding other groups including sunni and kurdish communities contrast this with barzanis comments and you know there are issues on hand just last week he said iraq is obviously falling apart the time is here for the kurdistan people to determine their future and the decision of the people is what we are going to uphold old issues that wont go away have to do with old invasions in iraq watchers are more conversant with the invasion and occupation of iraq in 2003 and the subsequent defeat of baath party government and execution of saddam hussein what has followed iraqi insurgency emergence of alqaeda and then civil war then came the depletion of iraqi insurgency and what looked like improvements in public security leading to the establishment of democratic elections and formation of new shia led government and then the birth of the usiraq status of forces agreement which then led to the withdrawal of us forces from iraq but then again other issues unresolved led to a further rise of sectarian insurgency after us withdrawal with the spillover of the syrian civil war in the background but indeed western diplomats are thought to blame many of the current problems which have grown up between sunnis and shias on the willingness of iraqi prime minister maliki to follow irans demands watching out for the isis complications and the iranian influence from contemporary literature and cable relays of the happenings in iraq it is easy to come away with the feeling that isis is a conquering army sweeping everything before it as it rushes towards baghdad in what analysts have compared to the north vietnamese army advancing on saigon in 1975 it is true that isis is now attacking baquba just 37 miles down the road from baghdad it is also true that it terrified the national army last week and that three regular divisions simply collapsed as isis advanced agency reports say the islamic state in iraq and the levant isis is a jihadist group active in iraq and syria it was formed in april 2013 and grew out of alqaeda in iraq aqi it has since been disavowed by alqaeda but has become one of the main jihadist groups fighting government forces in syria and is making military gains in iraq interestingly reports are also saying that in baghdad bullets and pistols have tripled in price and you can scarcely buy a kalashnikov at all but this is not because nervous citizens are arming themselves against the isis onslaught it is due to the huge demand from the shia volunteers it is also thought that isis is hugely rich its capture of the iraqi city of mosul probably brought in an extra two billion dollars to its coffers and appallingly brutal analysts also fear that in baquba isis is getting close to the edge of sunni iraq those who know the countrys geography say there are two big sunni suburbs on the edge of baghdadamiriya and khadra which may soon pose a problem to the iraqi government but the city itself is predominantly shia for an organisation of fewer than 10000 fighters to be able to capture baghdad and hold it would require a wholesale collapse of morale among shia iraqis something that is hard to imagine especially after the savage photographs and videos that isis fighters have been putting on twitter and the web there is also the iranian influence according to a school of thought shia knows very well that isis regards them as heretics to be wiped out it says no mercy can be expected from an organization which boasts of crucifying its victims or using their heads as a football the school of thought also thinks that although there is another factor in the equation international help as the worlds predominant shia nation iran has sent a general from the elite alquds force of its revolutionary guards to advise on the defence of baghdad brig gen qasem soleimani is a symbol of irans determination to preserve the huge influence it has built up over the government of iraq the thinking gaining ground now is that the west is also judiciously allowing iran in from the cold so it can play a minor role in this crisis this thinking acknowledges that iran is the sole external power which if things go badly wrong can save iraq iraq has had a remarkable journey in conflict and the vicious cycle of more conflicts the countrys history book is replete with conflicts running through the series from last century after the eight year iraniraq war when many thought that everything about sadam husseins predecessor al bakr had been forgotten israel attacked an iraqi nuclear research centre at tuwaythah near baghdad in 1981 there were chemical attacks on kurds in 1988 with attacks on the kurdish town of halabjah with poison gas killing thousands four countries participated with troops during the initial invasion phase of the second gulf war 2003 which lasted from 19 march to 9 april 2003 these were the united states 148000 united kingdom 45000 australia 2000 and poland 194 thirtysix other countries were involved in its aftermath in preparation for the invasion 100000 us troops were assembled in kuwait the coalition forces also received support from kurdish irregulars in iraqi kurdistan now with the new military gathering and booths on the ground what is to be expected to happen in iraq with the sectarian clashes refusing to ebb will the rest of the world go with the us",

            "body": "all you need to know about isis the group behind the iraq crisis the islamic state of iraq and the levant isil also known as isis which dealt a spectacular blow to baghdads shiiteled government by grabbing iraqs second city mosul now poses a threat across the middle east known for its ruthless tactics and suicide bombers isis has already controlled the iraqi city of fallujah for five months and is also arguably the most capable force fighting president bashar alassad inside syria its takeover of mosul on tuesday prompted the united states to voice deep concern about the extremely serious situation and warn the jihadist sunni group poses a threat to the entire region un chief ban kimoons spokesman said he was gravely concerned by the serious deteriorating of the security situation in mosul isis is led by the shadowy abu bakr albaghdadi and backed by thousands of islamist fighters in syria and iraq many of them westerners and it appears to be surpassing alqaeda as the worlds most dangerous jihadist group western governments fear it could eventually emulate alqaeda and strike overseas but their biggest worry for now is likely the eventual return home of foreign fighters attracted by isis and baghdadi among them are men like mehdi nemmouche a 29yearold frenchman who allegedly carried out a deadly shooting on a jewish museum in belgium last month after spending a year fighting with isis in syria the soufan group a new yorkbased consultancy estimates that 12000 foreign fighters have travelled to syria including 3000 from the west and isis appears to have the greatest appeal with kings college london professor peter neumann estimating around 80 per cent of western fighters in syria have joined the group unlike other groups fighting assad isis is seen working towards an ideal islamic emirate that straddles syria and iraq and compared with alqaedas franchise in syria alnusra front it has lower entry barriers isil has also sought to appeal to nonarabs recently publishing two englishlanguage magazines having already released videos in english or with english subtitles the jihadist group claims to have had fighters from the britain france germany and other european countries as well as the united states and from the arab world and the caucasus much of the appeal also stems from baghdadi himself – the isil leader is touted as a battlefield commander and tactician a crucial distinction compared with alqaeda chief ayman alzawahiri for the last 10 years or more zawahiri has been holed up in the afghanistanpakistan border area and hasnt really done very much more than issue a few statements and videos said richard barrett a former counterterrorism chief at mi6 britains foreign intelligence service whereas baghdadi has done an amazing amount – he has captured cities he has mobilised huge amounts of people he is killing ruthlessly throughout iraq and syria if you were a guy who wanted action you would go with baghdadi barrett told afp baghdadi apparently joined the insurgency that erupted in iraq soon after the 2003 usled invasion in october 2005 american forces said they believed they had killed abu dua one of baghdadis known aliases in a strike on the iraqsyria border but that appears to have been incorrect as he took the reins of what was then known as the islamic state of iraq or isi in may 2010 after two of its chiefs were killed in a usiraqi raid since then details about him have slowly trickled out in october 2011 the us treasury designated him as a terrorist in a notice that said he was born in the iraqi city of samarra in 1971 and earlier this year iraq released a picture they said was of baghdadi the first from an official source depicting a balding bearded man in a suit and tie at the time baghdadi took over his group appeared to be on the ropes after the surge of us forces combined with the shifting allegiances of sunni tribesmen to deal him a blow but the group has bounced back expanding into syria in 2013 baghdadi sought to merge with alnusra which rejected the deal and the two groups have operated separately since zawahiri has urged isis to focus on iraq and leave syria to alnusra but baghdadi and his fighters have openly defied the alqaeda chief and indeed have fought not only assad but also alnusra and other rebel groups here is a timeline of the advance of the group which has been facilitated by the internal conflict between the sunni minority and the ruling shiites 2011 on december 22 four days after the us withdrawal from iraq a series of attacks in baghdad in which 60 are killed is claimed by a branch of alqaeda the islamic state of iraq isi led by the shadowy abu bakr albaghdadi isi was set up after the usled invasion in 2003 the isi is particularly influential in the provinces of anbar nineveh and kirkuk where a jihadist insurrection inflicted heavy losses on us forces between 2003 and 2006 especially in fallujah in anbar province 2012 considering itself mistreated and sidelined from positions of power iraqs sunni minority launches massive demonstrations which continue throughout 2013 especially in anbar fuelled by sunni ire and the conflict in syria unrest reaches its worst point for five years with 9475 civilians killed in 2013 according to the nongovernmental organisation iraq body count on a daily basis

kurdish town of ras alain next to the turkish border on november 21 2013 afp photoachilleas zavallis baghdad afp – the islamic state of iraq and the levant jihadist group which spearheaded a sweeping militant assault that overran swathes of iraq is now claiming leadership of the worlds muslims known for its ruthless tactics and suicide bombers isil has carried out frequent bombings and shootings in iraq and is also arguably the most capable force fighting president bashar alassad inside syria but it truly gained international attention this month when its fighters and those from other militant groups swept through the northern city of mosul then overran major areas of five provinces north and west of baghdad isil is led by the shadowy abu bakr albaghdadi and backed by thousands of islamist fighters in syria and iraq some of them westerners and it appears to be surpassing alqaeda as the worlds most dangerous jihadist group in a sign of the groups confidence it has now expanded its claim of leadership to encompass all the worlds muslims in an audio recording distributed online friday isils spokesman abu mohammad aladnani declared baghdadi the caliph and leader for muslims everywhere the shura council of the islamic state met and discussed this issue of the caliphate the islamic state decided to establish an islamic caliphate and to designate a caliph for the state of the muslims adnani said he was referring to a system of rule last used to govern a state almost 100 years ago before the collapse of the ottoman empire western governments fear isil could eventually emulate alqaeda and strike overseas but their biggest worry for now is its sweeping gains in iraq and the likely eventual return home of foreign fighters attracted by isil and baghdadi among them are men like mehdi nemmouche a 29yearold frenchman who allegedly carried out a deadly shooting on a jewish museum in belgium after spending a year fighting with isil in syria 12000 foreign fighters the soufan group a new yorkbased consultancy estimates that 12000 foreign fighters have travelled to syria including 3000 from the west and isil appears to have the greatest appeal with kings college london professor peter neumann estimating around 80 percent of western fighters in syria have joined the group unlike other groups fighting assad isil is seen working towards an ideal islamic emirate and compared with alqaedas franchise in syria alnusra front it has lower entry barriers isil has also sought to appeal to nonarabs publishing englishlanguage magazines after having already released videos in english or with english subtitles the jihadist group claims to have had fighters from the britain france germany and other european countries as well as the united states and from the arab world and the caucasus much of the appeal also stems from baghdadi himself — the isil leader is touted as a battlefield commander and tactician a crucial distinction compared with alqaeda chief ayman alzawahiri baghdadi has done an amazing amount — he has captured cities he has mobilised huge amounts of people he is killing ruthlessly throughout iraq and syria said richard barrett a former counterterrorism chief at mi6 britains foreign intelligence service if you were a guy who wanted action you would go with baghdadi barrett told afp at the time baghdadi took over what was then known as the islamic state of iraq or isi in may 2010 his group appeared to be on the ropes after the surge of us forces combined with the shifting allegiances of sunni tribesmen to deal him a blow but the group has bounced back expanding into syria in 2013 baghdadi sought to merge with alnusra which rejected the deal and the two groups have operated separately since related sunni militants have

everywhere setting up a caliphate ruled by the strict islamic law has long been a goal of many jihadists meanwhile iraqs army continued an offensive to retake the northern city of tikrit from the

recording posted on the internet isis militants said they would now want to be known as the islamic state kurdish troops clashed with isis in jalawla in iraqs northern province of diyala isis also said that from now on it would be known simply as the islamic state the bbcs middle east editor jeremy bowen says the declaration harks back to the rise of islam when the prophet muhammads followers conquered vast territories in the middle ages the sunnishia split happened because of a dispute over the succession to muhammad with the sunnis following caliphs as their religious authority analysis the bbcs paul adams in baghdad its easy to dismiss the latest crop of isis videos and statements as mere propaganda however well produced but the announcement of the establishment of a caliphate is rich with religious cultural and historic significance generations of sunni radicals have dreamt of a moment when in the words of isis spokesman abu muhammad aladnani muslims shake off the dust of humiliation and disgrace and a new caliphate rises out of the chaos confusion and despair of the modern middle east many sunnis and all shias will recoil in horror from the barbarism that has accompanied this moment but the sight of old colonialera boundaries being erased is a powerful statement designed to attract new recruits to this whirlwind jihad in one of the isis videos uploaded on sunday a bearded fighter called abu safiyya guides the viewer around a newly demolished border post the video with its arresting imagery and impressive production values is designed to electrify the groups followers the fact that abu safiyya is described as being from chile merely adds to what the authors hope is now the organisations global appeal isis said the islamic state would extend from aleppo in northern syria to diyala province in eastern iraq abu bakr albaghdadi the group said would become the leader of the state and would be known as caliph ibrahim in the recording the rebels

leader or caliph caliphs are regarded by their followers as successors to muhammad and sovereign over all muslims first caliphate came into being after prophet muhammads death in 632 in the centuries which followed caliphates had dominion in the middle east and north africa the last widely accepted caliphate was abolished in 1924 by turkish leader kemal ataturk after the collapse of the ottoman empire the ahmadiyya sect of islam has recognised a caliphate for the last century but it is only this group that does so on sunday iraqi government jets struck at rebel positions and clashes broke out in various parts of tikrit witnesses and officials said the security forces are advancing from different areas ltgen qassem atta told journalists there are ongoing clashes troops had reportedly

administration was not arming islamic radicals in each of your many posts you provided zero information or support for your position you provided no information on where isis got its us material training etc the obama administration was arming islamic radicals to overthrow the syrian government i could reference many articles but i will use just one httpwwwpbsorgwgbhpagesfrontlineforeignaffairsdefensesyriaarmingtherebelssyrianrebelsdescribeusbackedtraininginqatar i am more than happy to listen to an informed and intelligent opinion based on facts to detective the jordanian officials said all isis members who received us training to fight in syria were first vetted for any links to extremist groups like alqaida yep they were totally vetted by

now members of isisisil or is that a conclusion people wanted to jump to to detective in each of your many posts you provided zero information or support for your position in other words i did not prove a negative again the us training syrian rebels who are not all islamists does not mean the us trained isis thats an unsupported assumption based on no facts there is zero proof so far that the us trained islamic radicals in syria to detective isis in iraq is a redo of the disastrous us foreign policy that trained and supported the taliban and al queda in afghanistan in the 1980s the idiotic and ignorant andor treasonous cia state department apparatus egged on by socalled friends of the us in the middle east has ignorantly fumbled into supporting local agendas not in the us long term interest in the name of some temporary objective of the us at a moment in time opposing the sovietsassad for instance it is never true that every enemy of an opponent of ours is our friend or even worthy of our support allies of convenience should always be suspect and should be avoided particularly when no direct us national interest is involved for which friends did we side with the taliban and al queda in afghanistan in the 1980s who supplied more of the funds than we did answer the saudis and some of the gulf states ditto the opposition to assad agenda in both cases it was islamic and

were shown as well as other articles detailing that the us was arming and training islamic radicals in jordan there are statements by jordanian officials that isis members were among those trained that is not zero proof you have provided no explanation regarding where isis received their training and their us made weapons and other material there is nothing more to say you disagree with the article i get that to rusty0604 well i did read a report that alqaida kicked them out for being too extreme that report is cya bull crap no one on this earth is too extreme for al qeada the only reason al qeada would have kicked them out is if they discovered they were a state run organization and they were being run by the wrong states 64 posted on 06172014 121302 pm pdt by justahairyape the user name is sarcastic although at times it may not appear that way to detective there is the cbs article you were shown as well as other articles detailing that the us was arming and training islamic radicals in jordan the cbs article specifically says secular rebels there are statements by jordanian officials that isis members were among those trained yet they remain conveniently anonymous you have provided no explanation regarding where isis received their training first i dont see a whole lot of training second alqaeda and other groups do plenty of their own training as do other powers secret services like turkey and russia to name two their us made weapons and other material the weapons they have seem to be a combination of old russian arms and confiscated us arms left behind by iraqi deserters there is nothing more to say from your perspective i can see why this is very flimsy reasoning you disagree with the article i get that i dont disagree with it you disagree with opinions i am calling out the article for assuming facts not in evidence to wuli the taliban didnt exist until 1995six years after the soviet withdrawal and they were a creation of pakistan 66 posted

good thing that the un did was korea to detective were first vetted for any links to extremist groups what does that mean that they were asked to check a box swearing that they are not affiliated with extremist groups just like with obamacare just check a box that you are eligible and not an illegal pj 68 posted on 06172014 123621 pm pdt by political junkie too if you are the posterity of we the people then you are a natural born citizen to wideawake actually the obama administration in late 2012 had to declare one of the syrian rebel groups as an al qaeda linked terrorist organization that made it illegal for a us citizen to support them why was al nusra declared an illegal terrorist organization because they were part of al qaeda in iraq and al qeada in iraq later becane isil in early 2013 here was a news story about that announcement us syrian rebel group tied to al qaeda in iraq washington the obama administration is declaring a syrian rebel group with alleged ties to al qaeda as a terrorist organization its an effort to blunt the influence of extremists as the us steps up cooperation with the syrian opposition the state departments action blocks jabhat alnusras assets in the us and bars americans from doing business with the group the move hasnt been announced officially but was included in the federal register on monday the department said the group was part of al qaeda in iraq 69 posted on 06172014 123910 pm pdt by justahairyape the user name is sarcastic although at times it may not appear that way to jacob kell or if isis wanted more power for themselves than what al qaeda was willing to give isis was al qaeda in iraq who kicked them out al nusra this is the old al nusraisis break away play they used in late 20122013 pulled out of the closet and renewed for prime time 70 posted on 06172014 124203 pm pdt by justahairyape the user name is sarcastic although at times it may not appear that way to justahairyape and check this article out from the ny slimes us places militant syrian rebel group on list of terrorist organizations the notice in the register lists the al nusra front as one of the aliases of al qaeda in iraq the al nusra front comprises only a small minority of the syrian rebels but it includes some of the rebellions most battlehardened and effective fighters 71 posted on 06172014 125509 pm pdt by justahairyape the user name is sarcastic although at times it may not appear that way to justahairyape no one is arguing that there arent islamic radical groups in syria affiliated with isil alqaeda or both the question is whether the us trained their members there is as yet zero evidence of that this claim is patterned after the same tired narrative that erroneously states that the us trained or funded osama bin laden to justahairyape note this says disavowed not that they were too extreme al qaeda wants extremist how the heck can you be more extreme then wearing a suicide vest profile islamic state in iraq and the levant isis isis was formed in april 2013 and grew out of alqaeda in iraq aqi it has since been disavowed by alqaeda but become one of the main jihadist groups fighting government forces in syria and is making military gains in iraq 73 posted on 06172014 10215 pm pdt by justahairyape the user name is sarcastic although at times it may not appear that way to wideawake the iranians have documented evidence that isis has arms supplied by the gcc obamas but boys 74 posted on 06172014 10338 pm pdt by justahairyape the user name is sarcastic although at times it may not appear that way to wideawake obama basically admitted he was funding terrorist in syria when he himself had to declare one of the groups as a terrorist organization training is immaterial to money and arms with money you can buy training for the arms 75 posted on 06172014 10534 pm pdt by justahairyape the user name is sarcastic although at times it may not appear that way to detective obama got sandbagged bigtime by the syrian rebels obama gave them arms money and training they asked for more and moreand they got it they stockpiled the arms and held back the best fighters so they could knock down a berm and invade iraq this all is not a story because besides obama another progressive media darling named john mccain is fully complicit the left wing media wont criticize obama and right wing media wont criticize mccain giant farse is what were watching 76 posted on 06172014 10909 pm pdt by fitzy888 ownership society to wideawake i am calling out the article for assuming facts not in evidence now you are just playing games with words you have provided no evidence whatsoever you have made one incredulous assumption after another first you assume every fighter the obama administration trained was a secularist whatever that is supposed to mean you assume all of the fighters trained were 100 honest and virtuous and would never lie to the us officials giving them arms training and whatever else you assume anyone who says isis was trained and armed in jordan is automatically lying this is just a waste of my time we just have to agree to disagree to 353fmg eventually theyll get there too 78 posted

when he himself had to declare one of the groups as a terrorist organization again just because some of the syrian opposition groups are terrorist organizations does not mean that all of are or than any of the individuals we trained are to detective now you are just playing games with words i am the only one who isnt here is the word game the logical fallacy most of the reasoning here is based on america trained some syrian rebels some syrian rebels are islamic terorists therefore the us trained islamic terrorists this is a basic logical mistake you have provided no evidence whatsoever i have no obligation to provide evidence the article is claiming that it is a fact that the us trained isil it is their burden to prove it yet they have provided no evidence to wideawake the al nusra al qaeda were the best fighters amongst the rebels why would you not help them if your goal was to topple assad obama only called them terrorists when he assumed that assads fall was inevitable at the time he also thought that al qaeda would be a threat to the climax of the rebellion he used them and that is why they are coming to new york 81 posted on 06172014 15203 pm pdt by justahairyape the

overthrow the syrian government some of these fighters were islamic terrorists and members of radical organizations and jordanian officials said some of these fighters who were armed and trained were

obama was illegally placed into our white house to do all the lawlessness were seeing accelerating at breakneck speed now that obamas handlers have the flexibility of not having to hide their fangs to deceive the voters was predicted early on by those of us who recognized obama as a foreign enemy combatant and recognized that if the cowards in our system who called us crazy would poopooh the crimes committed to put obama in the white house then complete lawlessness would ensue obama as a foreign enemy combatant was not a distraction it was the core of everything all the little droppings hes left along the way were the distractions keeping anybody from seeing the forest because of all the trees in the way the scandals have only borne out what the people who knew the truth about obama have been saying all along we who have been called crazy or embarrassing for the last 5 or so years until the system gets over its idiocy and admits that we were right about obamas origins and intentions this evil regime is going to install sharia all over the globe by arming and aiding the enemies of the free world and robbing from gagging and harassing those who fight for the free world everything obama has done makes sense once you know who he is and what he is about he is a foreign enemy combatant illegally placed in our white house through threats murder and a multitude of crimes such as perjury and forgery done by officials within the system think the dark knight the people who put obama into power are the real joker infiltrating the system and turning it against the very people it was supposed to serve turning the system into a terroristic regime i think people have a pervasive sense that this is what were seeing at an alarming escalating pace but none of the people with power are

islamic state of iraq and syria isis has publicly executed and crucified nine men in syria eight of them rebels fighting both president bashar alassads regime and the jihadists a monitor said on sunday the report comes amid fierce clashes on the outskirts of damascus between the isis which is spearheading a major offensive in iraq and rebels the syrian observatory for human rights said isis executed eight men in deir hafer in the east of aleppo province on saturday because they belonged to rebel groups that had fought against the jihadists as well as assads forces it said isis then crucified them in the main square of the village where their bodies will remain for three days the britainbased monitor said also in aleppo province a ninth man was executed and crucified in albab town near the border with turkey isis first emerged in syrias war in late spring last year and was initially welcomed by some syrian rebels who believed its combat experience would help topple assad but subsequent jihadist abuses quickly turned the syrian opposition including islamists against isis undated photo showing isis jihadists marching through syrias raqqa rebels launched a major antiisis offensive in january 2014 and have pushed them out of large swathes of aleppo province and all of idlib in the northwest however isis remains firmly rooted in raqa its northern syrian headquarters and wields significant power in deir ezzor in the east near the border with iraq activists say the groups iraq offensive and capture of heavy weapons — some of them usmade — appears to have boosted its confidence in syria east of damascus fierce clashes broke out early sunday between rebels from the army of islam and isis near the town of hammuriyeh the observatory said this photo uploaded in a jihadist website shows isis jihadists carrying out a mass execution of captured iraqi soldiers the army of islam is a major component of the islamic front syrias largest rebel coalition which has been fighting isis for months but such fighting in damascus province is unprecedented regime soldiers and warplanes backed by lebanons shia hezbollah also pounded rebel positions near the capital with rockets and surfacetosurface missiles said the local coordination committees activist network syrias war began as a peaceful protest movement in march 2011 demanding political change but became an armed insurgency when assads regime unleashed a brutal crackdown many months into the fighting jihadists began to flock to syria where upwards of 162000 people have been killed and millions displaced in more than three years of conflict isis establishes caliphate claims leadership of islamic world the isis is now claiming leadership of the worlds muslims known for its ruthless tactics and suicide bombers isis has carried out frequent bombings and shootings in iraq and is also arguably the most capable force fighting president bashar alassad inside syria this photo shows isis jihadists from britain fighting in syria and iraq but it truly gained international attention this month when its fighters and those from other militant groups swept through the northern city of mosul then overran major areas of five provinces north and west of baghdad isis is led by the shadowy abu bakr albaghdadi and backed by thousands of islamist fighters in syria and iraq some of them westerners and it appears to be surpassing alqaida as the worlds most dangerous jihadist group in a sign of the groups confidence it has now expanded its claim of leadership to encompass all the worlds muslims isis jihadists pose before an iraqi army humvee captured in northern iraq in an audio recording distributed online friday isiss spokesman abu mohammad aladnani declared baghdadi the caliph and leader for muslims everywhere the shura council of the islamic state met and discussed this issue of the caliphate the islamic state decided to establish an islamic caliphate and to designate a caliph for the state of the muslims adnani said he was referring to a system of rule last used to govern a state almost 100 years ago before the collapse of the ottoman empire western governments fear isis could eventually emulate alqaida and strike overseas but their biggest worry for now is its sweeping gains in iraq and the likely eventual return home of foreign fighters attracted by isis and baghdadi supporters of isis in norther iraq chant projihadist slogans in northern iraq among them are men like mehdi nemmouche a 29yearold frenchman who allegedly carried out a deadly shooting on a jewish museum in belgium after spending a year fighting with isis in syria the soufan group a new yorkbased consultancy estimates that 12000 foreign fighters have travelled to syria including 3000 from the west and isis appears to have the greatest appeal with kings college london professor peter neumann estimating around 80 per cent of western fighters in syria have joined the group unlike other groups fighting assad isis is seen working towards an ideal islamic emirate and compared with alqaidas franchise in syria alnusra front it has lower entry barriers isis has also sought to appeal to nonarabs publishing englishlanguage magazines after having already released videos in english or with english subtitles the jihadist group claims to have had fighters from the britain france germany and other european countries as well as the united states and from the arab world and the caucasus much of the appeal also stems from baghdadi himself — the isis leader is touted as a battlefield commander and tactician a crucial distinction compared with alqaida chief ayman alzawahiri a handout picture released by the iraqi government on january 29 2014 shows a photograph purportedly of abu bakr albaghdadi the leader of isis baghdadi has done an amazing amount — he has captured cities he has mobilised huge amounts of people he is killing ruthlessly throughout iraq and syria said richard barrett a former counterterrorism chief at mi6 britains foreign intelligence service if you were a guy who wanted action you would go with baghdadi barrett told afp at the time baghdadi took over what was then known as the islamic state of iraq or isi in may 2010 his group appeared to be on the ropes after the surge of us forces combined with the shifting allegiances of sunni tribesmen to deal him a blow but the group has bounced back expanding into syria in 2013 baghdadi sought to merge with alnusra which rejected the deal and the two groups have operated separately since",

            "body": "islámský stát v iráku a levantě vývoj podoba perspektivy deník referendum o islámském státě v iráku a levantě zkráceně isis či isil slyšel v posledních dnech snad každý známo je že jde o islamistickou džihádistickou entitu že kromě iráku působí taktéž v sýrii a že se ho pro krutost zřekla i alkáida všechna média také zaznamenala jeho triumfální dobytí mosulu 6 až 10 června – událost po níž následoval úprk asi 30tisícové posádky před skupinou 800 až 1300 džihádistů a zároveň útěk přibližně půl milionu obyvatel z 18milionového města zaregistrováno dále bylo že bojovníci isis popravili zajatce zkonfiskovali všechna letadla na mosulském mezinárodním letišti a zabrali opuštěnou vojenskou techniku včetně vrtulníku a tanků které dostala irácká armáda od američanů se slevou aby se právě před džíhádisty lépe bránila a zaznamenáno bylo též že isis vyraboval z mosulských bank ceniny v hodnotě půl miliardy dolarů čímž se stal zřejmě nejbohatší organizací svého druhu nyní ovládl isis další města a prý si troufá už i na bagdád šiítský režim núrího málikího je zjevně zoufalý neboť vyzbrojuje koho může a žádá o vojenský zásah kde může – včetně ameriky a íránu zároveň ale i toto se už všeobecně ví čeho je naopak stále pomálu to jsou odpovědi na otázky důležité pro kontext dění například jak mohl isis vyrůst natolik že se svými několika tisíci bojovníky nahání hrůzu čtvrtmilionové irácké armádě kde bere peníze a když je tak krutý proč jej řada iráčanů podporuje no a samozřejmě jakou hrozbu vlastně realisticky vzato představuje než se naplno rozproudí debata o nové sektářskoobčanské válce novém zázemí pro teroristy v nedávno osvobozené zemi či o vině a odpovědnosti patří se právě u těchto souvislostí zastavit od saddáma do současnosti předně a za prvé islámský stát v iráku a levantě není tak jednoznačně uchopitelnou entitou jako tálibán nebo islámský džihád z jistého pohledu se jedná o teroristickou organizaci z jiného o milici z dalšího o džihádistickou skupinu a z ještě dalšího o protostátní strukturu jeho deklarovaným cílem bylo sice vždy vytvoření podmínek pro vznik islámského chalífátu rozkládajícího se od sinaje po perský záliv v různém období vývoje měl ale různou podobu a používal různé metody ve svých začátcích působil isis jako odbojová teroristická skupina vznikl ještě za saddámovy éry z iniciativy proslulého jordánského teroristy abú músy zarkávího po invazi se stal součástí irácké sítě alkáidy a velice záhy i jejím vůdčím tělesem v letech 2004 až 2006 představoval isis v podstatě alkáidu v iráku v roce 2006 byl ale zarkáví zabit a káidisté posléze rozehnání tzv surge generála petraeuse – tažením sunnitských kmenových bojovníků vyzbrojených a zaplacených američany káidistické struktury isis tak zanikly zůstaly pouze podzemní buňky oživení isis nastalo pak až v souvislosti s arabským jarem – s prvním potlačením sunnitských protestů proti nespravedlnostem šíitské nadvlády v iráku a také se začátkem občanské války v sýrii do níž se isis zapojil v roce 2011 to už byl ovšem jiný isis – nikoliv síť buněk ale zárodek džihádistické armády v sýrii se začalo organizaci dařit ovládla několik velkých měst a posléze i plynová pole z nichž dosud získává surovinu za statisíce dolarů týdně pohltila několik menších organizací zájemců o členství přibývalo na jaře 2013 už byla nejsilnější protiasadovskou skupinou v zemi a v létě otevřeně bojovala i s ostatními odbojovými uskupeními – včetně těch které jsou ovládány alkáidou přímo úspěchy isis v iráku přišli o něco později – spolu s tím jak se rokem 2012 počínaje začal vymezovat vůči sunnitským kmenovým náčelníkům pod vedením ibrahíma alího badrího známého jako abú bakr bagdádí isis hlásal že dosavadní sunnitské protesty byly šíitskému establishmentu jen pro smích a že je třeba bojovat isis se zde stal radikálnější alternativou tradičních sunnitských struktur a nemálo sunnitů se s ním ztotožnilo na začátku arabského jara disponoval isis asi tisíci muži v roce 2012 jich měl už 2500 na jaře 2013 se isis definitivně rozešel s alkáidou oficiálně se tak stalo proto že postbinládinskému vedení organizace v čele s ajmánem zavahírím vadil způsob jakým isis likviduje své konkurenční souvěrce v sýrii zavahírí sám se ovšem vymezil nejprve vůči irácké větvi isis kterou nařídil rozpustit v lednu 2013 – pochopitelně bez úspěchu syrské větve se alkáida otevřeně zřekla až v únoru 2014 v iráku isis ovládl nejprve území na středozápadě země a velkou část iráckosyrské hranice v provincii anbár poté zaútočil na proslulou věznici abú ghraíb čímž získal další slávu a část osvobozených vězňů zapojil do svých řad následovaly tuhé boje při nichž dle osn zemřelo na devět tisíc iráčanů v prosinci 2013 se ale už k isis hlásilo pět tisíc ozbrojenců a organizace pronikala do dvou sunnitských měst která otevřeně povstala proti šíitské vládě do fallúdže a ramádí obě města pak irácká armáda několikrát znovu dobyla a znovu ztratila na západ od nich se ale už na delší dobu neodvážila isis prohlásil v únoru 2014 území svého působení – tedy oblast od syrského aleppa po iráckou fallúdžu – za nový samostatný stát ozbrojenci isis se od té chvíle vnímají jako armáda této entity v rozporu s líčením agentur ovšem není celé toto území pod nezpochybnitelnou kontrolou džihádistů mimo města lze narazit spíše jen na hlídky na strategických místech nebo na jednotky vynucující pořádek či likvidující ty kdo jim odporují pouze ve městech kde působí déle isis zřizuje kromě pořádkových stanovišť i vlastní školy soudy základní veřejné služby a jak připomíná mark tran v guardianu dokonce i určitý systém ochrany spotřebitele když kontroluje například ceny nebo nezávadnost potravin nahoře oblast pod kontrolou isis dle běžné agenturní interpretace repro z vysílání čt dole přesnější znalecký pohled práce analytiků vydavatelského domu mcclatchy irácký novinář mušrek abbás uvádí že bojovníci isis nezabíjejí ty kdo se jim ihned podřídí isis celkově se snaží v iráku před bojem zpravidla vyjednávat a jenom zřídkakdy usmrcuje duchovní vůči odpůrcům se ale chová tak nemilosrdně jak to jen jde v mosulu osvobodil isis minulý týden 2400 vězňů a v tikrítu další tři sta tikrítských bylo sunnitů kteří si zároveň odpykávali trest za terorismus kvalifikované odhady uvádějí že islámský stát v iráku a levantě nyní disponuje silou sedm až deset tisíc mužů ve zbrani a dík kvapnému stažení irácké armády i novou těžkou technikou důvody úspěšnosti dva z důvodů úspěchů isis byly již představeny v běžném zpravodajství jde jednak o několikaleté soustavné zneýhodňování sunnitů šíity jež vedlo část sunnitské šestimilionové menšiny k podpoře protestů a po jejich potlačení k podpoře isis jako úspěšné ozbrojené alternativy a jednak o žalostný stav irácké armády mezi sunnity podporují v současnosti isis jak nespokojení radikálové tak část kmenových vůdců přestože právě vůči nim se isis původně vymezoval a zřejmě i část důstojníků bývalé saddámovy armády pomoc kmenových vůdců byla zřejmá při dobývání mosulu a zvláště pak dalších měst vidět byli zejména jako prostředníci kteří předávali armádním velitelům ultimata nebo přesvědčovali odpovědné důstojníky aby raději utekli i díky vlivu kmenových vůdců projely konvoje s bojovníky isis řadou checkpointů i celých měst bez zastavení resp bez nutnosti likvidovat odpor rozsah zapojení důstojníků saddámovy armády je naopak stále sporný téměř žádní ze znalců nepochybují že vedení isis jich několik radí avšak prominenti strany baas z nichž se někdejší armádní velení rekrutovalo zrovna nepatřili k zastáncům islamistických vizí velká část expertů se domnívá že isis si některé generály prostě koupil – ostatně stejně jako část kmenových vůdců kteří po dubnových a šíity opět ovládnutých volbách naznali že režim o spolupráci s nimi nestojí pokud jde o iráckou armádu připomínají znalci že problém není pouze v nedostatku výcviku ale také ve zkorumpovanosti hodnostmi generálů a pozicemi velících důstojníků byli až příliš často odměňováni členové prominentních rodin a stran anebo známí známých tito pak vzali při poslední ofenzívě do zaječích většinou dříve než jejich vlastní vojáci k nesporným zkušenostem isis v boji získaným v sýrii je nutné připočíst dále strach jenž ozbrojenci šíří a kombinaci klasického válečnictví s urbánní guerillou bombovými útoky a sebevražednými atentáty pozorovatelé si pak ještě všímají vysoké mobility oddílů isis využívané jak strategicky tak takticky do tikrítu například vpadly v šedesáti vozech různých typů ze čtyř různých směrů zároveň obecným důvodem úspěšnosti isis v iráku je nesporně rozklad celého státu v souvislosti s posledním děním vyšlo najevo že premiér núrí málikí žádal již v březnu američany o novou vojenskou intervenci v podobě leteckých úderů s odůvodněním že irácká armáda podobný úkol nezvládne spojené státy tehdy odmítly a slíbily dodat pouze další zbraně irácká armáda následně nasadila při znovudobývání fallúdži dělostřelectvo a to i v rezidenčních čtvrtích současný bagdádský režim navíc nemá ani dost stálou politickou základnu premiér málikí a jeho oblíbení ministři se v posledních letech snažili obcházet parlament jak se dalo a nyní dva měsíce po volbách nedají dohromady nejen většinovou vládu ale ani státotvornou většinu poslanců ostatně když se málikí snažil vyhlásit po pádu mosulu v provincii ninive výjimečný stav tři pětiny zákonodárců vůbec nedorazily na zasedání konečně nelze pominout ani hlavní prapříčinu – původní destabilizaci regionu kterou způsobila invaze spojených států a koalice ochotných v roce 2003 mezi analytiky se teď pravděpodobně rozproudí debata zdali napáchala rozhodující zlo invaze samotná nebo až to co se dělo po ní jedno je ale jisté jedinou účinnou obranou proti islamistickým extrémistům se v prostředí blízkého východu ukázal být silný stát – ať už demokratický nebo nikoliv a intervence v iráku tento silný stát zničila aniž by se její aktéři následně postarali o vybudování nového nefunkční stát korupce ohromné množství zbraní znevýhodňování až útlak náboženské menšiny a krvavé potlačování její protestů – to vše vytvořilo prostředí v němž se islámskému státu v iráku a levantě přirozeně daří otázka hrozby na první pohled se nezdá pravděpodobné že by isis dokázal ovládnout šíitskou sídelní oblast s posvátnými městy nadžáf a karbala o bagdádu ani nemluvě šíitů žije v iráku na dvanáct milionů a jejich jednotlivé strany mají své milice a města domobrany irácká armáda navíc stále čítá přes 200 tisíc mužů a 800tisícovou zálohu před dobytím mosulu ale též nikdo nepředpokládal že by se isis mohlo podařit získat v iráku město větší než praha není tak divu že nyní irácká vláda shání posily kde se dá a to i za cenu toho že na irácké území pozve revoluční gardy z íránu podle většiny pozorovatelů teď bude isis především rozšiřovat svou oblast vlivu a upevňovat postavení přičemž bude iráckou armádu zaměstnávat rychlými výpady a děsit sebevražednými atentáty vedle oslabování pozic nepřítele se tak džihádistům může dařit poškozovat i irácký ropný průmysl otázkou zůstává zda se málikímu či američanům podaří získat resp uplatit tu část sunnitských kmenových vůdců která isis ještě nepodpořila a druhou neznámou je jak se vyvinou vztahy mezi bagdádskou vládou a kurdskou samosprávou resp mezi kurdy a isis dále pak není jasné zda některá z arabských vlád isis dnes skrytě nepodporuje iráčtí novináři píší o katarských či saúdskoarabských fondech samotný isis ale slibuje jak katarskou tak saúdskou vládu svrhnout jak připomíná patrick cockbur v independentu isis se po dobytí mosulu stal nejsilnější militantně džihádistickou organizací na světě a tak soukromí arabští dárci kteří dříve podporovali alkáidu teď mohou platit právě jemu bez jakéhokoliv nadsazení lze už dnes říci že na iráckosyrském pomezí vznikl útvar jenž se může stát útočištěm pro novou generaci islamistických teroristů oproti malijskému azavádu či tálibánem kontrolovanému afghánistánu má navíc velkou výhodu v případě úspěchu eventuálního odvetného tažení irácké armády se mohou bojovníci isis prostě stáhnout za syrskou hranici bude zapotřebí důsledně koordinované a mnohostranné ofenzívy jestliže má být isis poražen a také toto tažení bude mít v sobě určitou hrozbu nově vyzbrojení šíitší nebo najatí bojovníci se mohou začít při postupu přes sunnitské území mstít jak uvádí anthony cordesman na bbc iráku by nyní nejvíce pomohl celonárodní vůdce a plán na důsledné začlenění všech skupin obyvatelstva do správy státu takový státník a takový plán ale neexistují proto se spíše jen čeká koho všeho se málíkímu a jeho patronům podaří přesvědčit resp uplatit a doufá že krutost islámského státu v iráku a levantě nakonec obrátí většinu iráckých sunnitů proti němu další informace commondreamsorg bloody legacy of us invasion as tattered iraq teeters on edge the guardian iraq crisis isis

capturing their base in tikrit ap when the gunmen arrived in town one of their first tasks was to raid shops and confiscate every carton of cigarettes the tobacco was loaded on to a truck and was soon burning on a giant pyre under the watchful eyes of the fanatics for residents in raqqa near the border with iraq in northern syria this display of power was just a taste of life to come under isis within days the radical muslim group that is bulldozing through the region had decreed that women could not raise their voices in public or walk at a late hour without a male chaperone from elsewhere have come horrific stories of brutality including the alleged filming of mass executions now this group controls half of iraq and is knocking on the door of the capital baghdad when a force like that gets momentum and the security forces start to crumble it becomes difficult to stop former us commander led by a man who has been described as the new osama bin laden the aim of isis is a new muslim state straddling syria and iraq which is to be run under ultrastrict sharia law for anyone stepping out of line the punishments are harsh isis believes in crucifixion and the amputation of limbs for criminal acts its claimed that to set an example the heads of their dead enemies are boiled in oil it is a return to the dark ages last witnessed when the taliban joylessly governed afghanistan as the west dithers apparently taken by surprise by the speed of the invasion the iraqi government has likened the rule of isis in vast swathes of the country to the nazi occupation of europe and pleaded for help and our prime minister david cameron is warning that we should not dismiss isis as a foreign problem because the terror group is planning attacks in britain the ranks of isis are being swollen by impressionable young men from overseas including britons who are attracted by its religious ambition this week one of the britons calling himself abu rashash britani sent messages from the front line calling for cameron to be beheaded he also urged his muslim brothers in the uk to take to the streets isis believes muslim women should be fully covered up in public getty its only recently that isis which stands for islamic state of iraq and the levant has sprung to prominence the organisation was founded in april 2013 when it grew out of al qaeda in iraq its run by charismatic former al qaeda commander abubakr albaghdadi who commands an estimated 10000 fighters baghdadi who uses a series of other aliases earned a doctorate from the university of baghdad and is said to be an avid reader of poetry he became radicalised and was held prisoner by us forces from 2005 to 2009 according to us sources when he was released from camp bucca in iraq he remarked ill see you guys in new york he has earned a reputation as an astute leader who has exploited unrest between rival muslim groups and positioned isis as an even more radical alternative to al qaeda listed as a terrorist by the united nations in 2011 he has a £6million bounty on his head baghdadi keeps a low profile and when addressing his men is said to wear a mask to obscure his identity resulting in the nicknames the invisible sheikh and the ghost a sunni muslim he has extreme views about how people should live and when a town is liberated by isis forces sharia law is immediately declared women are encouraged to stay indoors most of the time supposedly for the stability of the home but when venturing out must wear full islamic dress including a veil and gloves leader abu bakr albaghdadi ap singing and dancing are banned along with alcohol cigarettes and the popular hookah pipe songs and music are forbidden in islam as they prevent one from the remembrance of god and the koran and are a temptation and corruption of the heart according to a statement issued by isis every smoker should be aware that with every cigarette he smokes in a state of trance and vanity he is disobeying god shop owners are forbidden from displaying images of people in their windows and ordered to close 10 minutes before prayer time its also considered a sin to build elaborate tombstones under islamic law death is final and resting places should be unadorned when prayers begin every man should attend a mosque or risk the wrath of the isis enforcers who describe themselves as soldiers of islam any political opposition to isis or the carrying of weapons by other groups is banned in the areas of syria it controls isis has set up courts schools and other services flying its black jihadi flag everywhere in raqqa it even started a consumer protection authority for food standards shutting down some street vendors and market traders taxes are imposed on local businesses and more chillingly it has operated a policy of killing all government employees including rubbish collectors the organisation even publishes an annual report to boost fundraising in which it publishes details of its atrocities the latest edition of alnaba the news boasts of 1000 assassinations planting more than 4000 roadside bombs and freeing hundreds of prisoners the march of isis began in syria but it was the capture of mosul iraqs second city with a population of two million people which sent shock waves through the region despite vastly outnumbering isis the iraqi army appears to have crumbled in the face of the onslaught which began only on june 9 and the invaders are now targeting the capital burning a mountain of cigarettes which are outlawed for being a distraction from god twitter one former us commander said when a force like that gets momentum and the security forces start to crumble it becomes difficult to stop worryingly isis appears to be well organised and awash with cash following the looting of banks in towns and cities seized along the way the group reportedly took hundreds of millions of dollars from mosuls branch of iraqs central bank according to some financial experts isis is already the richest terror organisation in the world with a £11billion fortune isis is said to earn significant amounts from the oilfields it controls in eastern syria reportedly selling some of the supply back to the syrian government it is now locked in battles for iraqs major oilfields isis which has also captured iraqi military equipment a handful of helicopters and vehicles is believed to have been selling looted antiquities from historical sites money also pours in from sympathisers in the gulf related articles an expert in middle east terrorism dr natasha underhill of nottingham trent university says isis was an opportunist organisation in syria that grew out of al qaeda but whats most worrying is that they were considered too extreme by al qaeda isis has a lust for power and has been able to go into iraq because there is so much disenchantment with the government there they are vastly outnumbered by the iraqi security forces but are very well organised and ferocious fighters most of the iraqi army is barely trained to fire a weapon the main tactic of isis is to make surprise attacks which inflict maximum casualties and spread fear before withdrawing propaganda videos show isis forcing families with sons in the iraqi army to dig their own graves before they are shot the terrifying message is clear enemies can expect no mercy dr underhill adds their interpretation of sharia law is very strict along with the punishments they impose the problem facing the outside world is how to react one possibility is an unlikely alliance between the us and its old enemy iran a spokesman for the iraqi government which has called for help from the us says we have a situation similar to rwanda where there is going to be genocide this is similar to the nazi occupation of europe however any us intervention could inflame the region and unwittingly help topple the regime that was left in place when troops were pulled out of iraq three years ago recent history has shown the risks of becoming embroiled in conflict in the middle east but there is also a reluctance to leave iraq to its fate at the cruel hands of isis from the evidence provided of their methods so far that is scarcely surprising",

band of militants that came from nowhere with nothing to having syrian oil fields and control of iraqs second city it is widely known by the acronym isis in which the final s stems from the arabic word alsham this can mean the levant syria or even damascus but in the context of the global jihad it refers to the levant roots in iraq when the group was formed in april 2013 it was initially presented as a merger between the alqaedaaffiliated islamic state of iraq isi and a syrian jihadist rebel group the alnusra front however the announcement of the merger by isi leader abu bakr albaghdadi was immediately rejected by the alnusra front two months later alqaeda leader ayman zawahiri reportedly ordered the merger to be annulled isis has since become one of the main jihadist groups fighting government forces in syria and now taking over iraq its precise size is unknown but it is thought to include thousands of fighters including many foreign jihadists warning this is reality in iraq be prepared for what you are about to see for it is spreading like wild fire throughout the middle east just released live video footage and live drone footage the islamic state in iraq and the levant is a jihadist group active in iraq and syria the capitulation of the military and the rapid advances of the insurgents have dramatically changed the balance of power in iraq crippled prime minister nouri almaliki allowed kurdish forces to seize control of the disputed city of kirkuk and galvanised a shia fightback along sectarian lines posing a serious threat to the regions fragile geopolitics on sunday isis published photographs that appeared to show it capturing and killing dozens of iraqi soldiers just what isisisils baaghdad strategy is remains unclear according to reuters in baghdad on sunday a suicide attacker detonated explosives in a vest he was wearing killing at least nine people and wounding 20 in a crowded street in the centre of the capital police and medical sources said at least six people were killed including three soldiers and three volunteers when four mortars landed at a recruiting centre in khlais 50 km 30 miles north of baghdad for now the southern offensive appears to have been halted with reuters reporting that the rapid advance south towards baghdad appeared to slow over the weekend however this has been offset by fierce fighting in the town of tal afar 60 km 40 miles west of mosul near the syrian border sundays fighting in tal afar a majority turkomen town which is home to both shiites and sunnis showed how volatile the deepening sectarian divisions have become residents in sunni districts accused shiite police and army forces of launching mortar fire at their neighbourhoods prompting isil forces stationed outside the town to move in the situation is disastrous in tal afar there is crazy fighting and most families are trapped inside houses they cant leave town a local official said if the fighting continues a mass killing among civilians could result more importantly iraqs resistance movements appears to be gathering steam as volunteers were gathered by army to join fighting to regain control of the northern town of udhaim from isil militants as reported last week the countrys most influential shiite cleric urged his countrymen to take up arms and defend the country against the hardline insurgents many of whom consider shiites as heretics resulting in thousands of volunteers which is perhaps why in order to further demorallize the local population isis militants boasted on twitter that they had executed 1700 iraqi government soldiers posting gruesome photos to support their claim the nyt reported the authenticity of the photographs and the insurgents claim could not be verified and iraqi government officials initially cast doubt on whether such a mass execution took place there were also no reports of large numbers of funerals in the salahuddin province area where the executions were said to have been conducted if the claim is true it would be the worst mass atrocity in either syria or iraq in recent years surpassing even the chemical weapons attacks in the syrian suburbs of damascus last year which killed 1400 people and were attributed to the syrian government remember that particular attack nearly culminated in a us land invasion of syriaand led to a us vs russia standoff in the military with dozens of warships prepared to fire at each other at a moments notice as the nyt adds the latest attack if proved would also raise the specter of the war in iraq turning genocidal particularly because the insurgents boasted that their victims were all shiites there were also fears that it could usher in a series of reprisal killings of shiites and sunnis like those seen in the iraq war in 20057 authentic or not the disturbing pictures appear to have had an effect with the office of the shiites supreme spiritual leader grand ayatollah ali alsistani saturday night issued what amounted to a revision of the ayatollahs call to arms on friday apparently out of concern that it was misinterpreted by many as a call for sectarian warfare the statement billed as clarifying the position on taking up arms implored iraqis especially those living in mixed areas to exert the highest level of selfrestraint during this tumultuous period the claim of the mass execution appeared on a twitter feed previously used for isis announcements so whether or not the executions were genuine the organization certainly intended to boast of them were trying to verify the pics and i am not convinced they are authentic said erin evers the human rights watch researcher in iraq as far as isis claiming it has killed 1700 people and publishing horrific photos to support that claim it is unfortunately in keeping with their pattern of commission of atrocities and obviously intended to further fuel sectarian war we find it somewhat ironic that when photos of gruesome execuctions in the middleeast do not support developed world interests in the region they are to be doubted however when a youtube clip appears of a mass execution by an insane dictator the us secretary of state promptly takes it as gospel and is used as a justification for invasion almost worth a case study in hypocrisy as a reminder using social media outlets to display fabricated propaganda in the form of video clips and pictures is nothing new and the only variable is who benefits first there was syria of course where fake youtube clips of a chemical attack were used to nearly launch a false flag war then it was egypt when as we showed before the muslim bortherhood staged a protest crackdown by the military regime in order to shore up popular upport in the muslim brotherhood the best straighttoyoutube actors money can buy so is the isil alqaeda spin off merely the latest entity to use social media propaganda in order to achieve strategic goals or is the

adnani spokesman for the islamic state in iraq and the levant describes the credentials for abu bakr albaghdadi who was declared caliph of all muslims by the isis on saturday the caliphate carved by the isis stretches from iraqs diyala province to syrias aleppo the isis celebrated what it termed was the removal of the limits of humiliation a reference to the border between syria and iraq the demarcation of which was a product of the infamous sykespicot agreement map showing isis plans to push further into europe and far east background isis draws its roots from the group alqaida in iraq established in april 2004 by cleric abu musab alzarqawi the aqi fought pitted battles against coalition forces and led pressure campaigns telling people not to support the usled invasion zarqawi was killed in an airstrike in 2006 and the new face of aqi abu ayyub almasri sought to politicise their insurgency and drew on iraqi nationalism as an ideological force the same year masri announced the formation of the islamic state of iraq led by iraqi national abu umar albaghdadi the islamic state of iraqs relationship with alqaida was fraught with ideological schisms alqaidas leaders often voiced concerns that the islamic state of iraqs policy of indiscriminate violence was alienating alqaida from popular thought masri and baghdadi were killed in april 2010 and it was the next leader abu bakr albaghdadi who would bring about the islamic state of iraqs divorce with alqaida the new leader had a vision far wider than the emancipation of iraq from foreign occupation as the aqi moved into syria in april 2013 abu bakr albaghdadi changed the organisations name to the islamic state of iraq and the levant isil in an audio recording in april 2013 he said that alnusrah front in syria was part of the islamic state in iraq and their goal was to establish an islamic state in iraq and syria he claimed that that the groups were merging in what would be a series of contradictory statements the alnusrah front denied the merger and pledged allegiance directly to alzawahiri as alzawahiri tried to mediate and declared alnusrah the official alqaeda branch in syria the newly formed isil defied high command and stepped up operations in syria alnusrah and isil groups turned on each other further cementing the break composition widely believed to have been the sanctuary for military leaders under former iraq president saddam hussein today isis hosts militants from up to 70 countries the influx of hundreds of thousands of foreign militants into syria meant that the isis had a large pool of militants to choose from while the world fretted about alqaida moving in to fill the vacuum created by clashes between asads government and rebels the isis provided fighters a platform led by a seasoned military commander by then considered more authoritative than alqaedas alzawahiri interestingly enough the us and turkey continued to backchannel funds and arms to militants in syria allowing the militant problem to fester any lessons learnt from the ussoviet proxy war in afghanistan in the 1980s were conveniently forgotten according to bbc 80 per cent of western fighters in syria have joined the group isis claims to have fighters from the uk france germany and other european countries as well as the us the arab world and the caucasus funding recently irans president hassan rouhani made a thinly veiled reference to muslim countries that support the terrorists with their petrodollars he was alluding to saudi arabia syria too has repeatedly pointed at saudi arabia as the source of most of the funding for isis several other persian gulfmiddle eastern countries including qatar kuwait and bahrain have been accused as well but isis sources of funding go beyond any of the sources henceforth tapped by militant groups by using the internet and social media to raise awareness and reach individual donors isis makes appeals for donations or investments via the internet a lot of the money is transferred withdrawn and transported in the form of bags of cash the group had taken over syrias eastern oil fields and was reportedly selling oil to the government it had sold ancient artefacts worth hundreds of thousands of rupees to raise funds but it was the june 10 bank heist in mosul that brought attention to how much capital the militant organisation owned isis operatives reportedly stole up to 425 million in cash in the largest bank holdup in recent memory the group even has a clothing line with a line of tshirts and hoodies that cost between 7 and 13 the group is considered as techsavvy as it is deadly on the ground and has been selling merchandise over the internet and telephones in several countries at present isis has an estimated 2 billion in funds enter the caliphate the khalīfah ibrāhīm may allah preserve him has fulfilled all the conditions for khilāfah mentioned by the scholars he was given bayah in iraq by the people of authority in the islamic state as the successor to abū umar albaghdādī may allah have mercy upon him his authority has expanded over wide areas in iraq and shām the land now submits to his order and authority from aleppo to diyala so fear allah o slaves of allah listen to your khalīfah and obey him support your state which grows everyday – by allahs grace – with honour and loftiness while its enemy increases in retreat and defeat reads a statement recently released by adnani announcing the new caliphate in the levant and iraq the groups expansionist plans however are not limited to the area alone many analysts fear that their next stop is saudi arabia analysts believe that if isis were to penetrate the saudi border the groups first stop would probably be the saudi town of arar where the saudi military is stationed they say the isis push into saudi arabia could be even easier than in iraq considering the overwhelming support it has from the sunni majority population the emergence of isis signals a hundredyear war for the gulf and all middle eastern countries growing dissent amongst the populace and unhindered channelling of funds to the organisation provide it the nurturing ground it needs to thrive as the us and iran prepare to launch an offensive against the militant organisation the region is going to prepare for what is probably the first of several unlikely alliances tacstrat analysis

            "body": "world leaders alarmed over isis takeover of mosul middle east news arutz sheva world leaders have reacted with alarm to the capture of iraqs second city by an al qaeda offshoot whose rapidlyexpanding control over vasts swathes of iraq and syria has seen it morph into a fullyfledged state in all but name the takeover of mosul on tuesday by the islamic state of iraq and the levant or isis prompted the united states to voice deep concern about the extremely serious situation and warn that the jihadist sunni group poses a threat to the entire region un secretary general ban kimoons spokesman also issue a statement saying the un chief was gravely concerned by the serious deteriorating of the security situation in mosul isis which also seized an international airport and captured usmade weapons and equipment during its rout of iraqi security forces has dealt a spectacular blow to baghdads shialed government by cementing its effective control over the entirety of the countrys western nineveh province and now poses a clear threat across the middle east in a desperate attempt to fend off the threat posed by the group who will now surely be eyeing further territorial gains iraqi prime minister nouri almaliki called a state of emergency and has offered to arm local tribes and citizens opposed to isis known for its ruthless tactics and suicide bombers isis has already controlled the iraqi city of fallujah for five months and is also arguably the most capable force fighting president bashar alassad inside syria isis is led by the shadowy abu bakr albaghdadi and backed by thousands of islamist fighters in syria and iraq many of them westerners and other foreign jihadists and it appears to be surpassing al qaeda as the worlds most dangerous terrorist group western governments fear it could eventually emulate al qaeda and strike overseas but their biggest worry for now is likely the eventual return home of foreign fighters attracted by isis and baghdadi among them are men like mehdi nemmouche a 29yearold frenchman who allegedly carried out a deadly shooting on a jewish museum in belgium last month after spending a year fighting with isis in syria working towards islamic emirate the soufan group a new yorkbased consultancy estimates that 12000 foreign fighters have traveled to syria including 3000 from the west and isis appears to have the greatest appeal with kings college london professor peter neumann estimating around 80 percent of western fighters in syria have joined the group unlike other groups fighting assad isis is seen working towards an ideal islamic emirate that straddles syria and iraq and compared with al qaedas franchise in syria al nusra front it has lower entry barriers isis has also sought to appeal to nonarabs recently publishing two englishlanguage magazines having already released videos in english or with english subtitles the jihadist group claims to have had fighters from the britain france germany and other european countries as well as the united states and from the arab world and the caucasus much of the appeal also stems from baghdadi himself the isis leader is touted as a battlefield commander and tactician a crucial distinction compared with al qaeda chief ayman alzawahiri for the last 10 years or more zawahiri has been holed up in the afghanistanpakistan border area and hasnt really done very much more than issue a few statements and videos said richard barrett a former counterterrorism chief at mi6 britains foreign intelligence service whereas baghdadi has done an amazing amount he has captured cities he has mobilised huge amounts of people he is killing ruthlessly throughout iraq and syria if you were a guy who wanted action you would go with baghdadi barrett told afp baghdadi apparently joined the insurgency that erupted in iraq soon after the 2003 usled invasion in october 2005 american forces said they believed they had killed abu dua one of baghdadis known aliases in a strike on the iraqsyria border but that appears to have been incorrect as he took the reins of what was then known as the islamic state of iraq or isi in may 2010 after two of its chiefs were killed in a usiraqi raid isi was al qaedas official branch in that country but after engaging in the syrian civil war against zawahiris explicit instructions and then threatening to alienate public support through his extremely brutal tactics the newlynamed isis was disowned by the al qaeda chief since then details about baghdadi have slowly trickled out bearded man with a suit and tie in october 2011 the us treasury designated him as a terrorist in a notice that said he was born in the iraqi city of samarra in 1971 and earlier this year iraq released a picture they said was of baghdadi the first from an official source depicting a balding bearded man in a suit and tie at the time baghdadi took over his group appeared to be on the ropes after the surge of us forces combined with the shifting allegiances of sunni tribesmen to deal him a blow but the group has bounced back expanding into syria in 2013 baghdadi sought to merge with alnusra which rejected the deal and the two groups have operated separately since more recently the two have engaged in armed clashes against one another as rebel groups joined forces to eject isis from syria rebels accuse isis of serving the syrian regimes agenda the group has embittered its rivals through its ruthless monopolization of territory attacking rebel forces and killing several prominent rebel leaders in its quest to establish its islamic state despite losing some territory to syrian rebels isis has consolidated its control over areas still under its control and middle east expert aymenn altamimi observed that previous conservative estimates of the groups strength were clearly vastly underestimating its capabilities speaking to the washington post tamimi noted that isiss ability to brush aside americantrained iraqi security forces in mosul at the same time as it is fighting on several other fronts in syria against rebels kurdish militias and syrian regime forces proves its manpower is far greater than the 10000 fighters it is widely reported to posses and speaking to arutz sheva yesterday he said its continued success should sound alarm bells if it turns out isis have taken exclusive control without sharing with other groups then this is very significant it means massive expansion of power and resources so in short they are just getting stronger and stronger",

risksthreats to global oil production 3 north america leads crude oil production gains 4 islamist state of iraq syria – a dangerous threat 5 why isis should worry americans europeans 6 our next webinar on july 23 featuring ycg overview recent reports have confirmed that the us is now the worlds largest producer of crude oil with output exceeding 11 million barrels per day in the 1q of this year this surpasses the daily oil production of russia and saudi arabia this is the first time in over 40 years that the us has once again become the largest producer of oil in the world – and this is despite the obama administrations continued ban on new drilling for oil in our coastal waterways oil extraction is soaring at shale formations in texas and north dakota as companies split rock formations believed to contain oil using highpressure liquids a process known as hydraulic fracturing or fracking this oil boom has dramatically lowered petroleum imports into america the share of us fuel consumption met by imports is down from 60 in 2005 to 33 in 2013 and is expected to fall to 22 in 2015 which would be the lowest since 1970 us passes russia saudi arabia to 1 in oil production us oil production has jumped from 50 million barrels per day in 2008 to 74 million last year and is expected to average 85 million this year and 93 million next year according to the energy information administration the analytical arm of the department of energy if crude oil separated from natural gas is included that figure jumps to 110 million barrels per day this year according to the parisbased international energy agency iea and a new report from bank america corp the united states recently topped russia and saudi arabia in total oil production to become the 1 producer in the world the us became the worlds largest natural gas producer in 2010 this oil boom has significantly lowered americas need for petroleum imports the share of us fuels consumption met by net imports down from 60 in 2005 to 33 in 2013 is expected to fall to 22 in 2015 which would be the lowest since 1970 texas and north dakota now account for almost half of total us oil production according to the energy department which noted that texas monthly oil output recently topped 3 million barrels per day for the first time since 1977 and north dakotas oil production hit a record 1 million bpd the widelyfollowed iea now expects the us to remain the 1 producer of crude oil until at least 2019 when production is expected to peak at 131 million barrels a day and plateau thereafter even so the iea suggests that the us could remain the 1 producer of oil for another decade or longer after 2019 crude oil prices in the us have retreated somewhat since the news on us oil production was announced earlier this month but it remains to be seen if prices will fall significantly below 100 per barrel crude prices have been rising since the first of the year due to various global concerns ranging from russias aggression toward ukraine to the isis terrorist takeover in parts of iraq and syria more on that below multiple risksthreats to global oil production the international energy agency predicts that global oil demand growth will rise next year as the world economy expands and will again be met by rising supplies from the united states and canada however the iea warned in its monthly report last week that risks to oil production in several regions remained acute supply risks in the middle east and north africa not least in iraq and libya remain extraordinarily high oil prices remain historically high and there is no sign of a turning of the tide just yet whether in crude or oil product markets there is little room for complacency north sea brent crude oil hit a ninemonth high above 115 a barrel in june as the isis insurgency swept across northwestern iraq taking control of significant territory and shutting down a large refinery more on this below fortunately most of iraqs oil production and export terminals are located in the southern part of the country the oil market has weakened somewhat over the last few weeks but remains nervous about further supply shocks west texas intermediate crude remains near 100 per barrel while brent crude is still trading near 105 per barrel as this is written north america leads crude oil production gains making its first forecasts for 2015 in its july report the iea which advises major consuming nations on energy policy estimates that global oil demand will grow by 14 million barrels per day next year up from growth of 12 million this year the iea expects newly industrialized and emerging market economies to once again lead the gains in oil demand next year the worlds second largest oil consumer china will see oil demand growing by 42 in 2015 up from 33 this year while the largest oil user the united states will only see gains of 02 to 191 million bpd up from a growth of 06 this year according to the iea the iea said it forecasts nonopec supply growth to average 12 million bpd next year in line with increases in 2013 and 2014 yet north america will remain the leader in 2015 contributing about twothirds of the net nonopec crude oil supply increase increases in us light crude oil mostly from north dakota and texas as well as canadian bitumen are expected to represent well over half of the 2014 nonopec supply growth according to the iea it added that the eagle ford shale boom in south texas will remain one of the most dynamic oil provinces with output growing by 34 to 14 million bpd this year and exceeding 16 million next year the iea reported that while the us and canada remain the mainstays for crude production growth other countries are also making progress – including brazil britain vietnam malaysia norway and columbia among countries which will grow output in 2015 islamist state of iraq syria isis – a dangerous threat isis is a radical jihadist militant group in iraq which has taken control of a large swath of northwestern iraq and parts of syria isis was formed in april 2013 and grew out of alqaeda in iraq and syria it has since been disavowed by alqaeda reportedly due to its ultraviolent and inhumane terrorist tactics isis is led by abu bakr albaghdadi little is known about him but it is believed he was born in samarra north of baghdad in 1971 and joined the insurgency that erupted in iraq soon after the 2003 usled invasion in 2010 he emerged as the leader of alqaeda in iraq isis is fighting to establish a new islamist state caliphate that straddles iraq and syria in june 2014 the economist reported that isis may have up to 6000 fighters in iraq and 3000–5000 in syria the group has seen considerable military success in march 2013 it took over the syrian city of raqqa the first provincial capital to fall under isis control in january 2014 it capitalized on growing tension between iraqs sunni minority and shialed government by taking control of the predominantly sunni city of fallujah in the western province of anbar it also seized large sections of the provincial capital ramadi and has a presence in a number of towns near the turkish and syrian borders isis leaves a path of destroyed churches shrines and even mosques in its wake but why would it destroy mosques georgetown university professor yvonne haddad says isis sees themselves as the last defenders of islamic civilization and want to eradicate anything they see as an enemy of islam and any muslim they perceive as compromising with the west a member of isis reportedly tweeted that their ultimate target is the kaaba sacred house in mecca saudi arabia islams most holy site the tweet reportedly said if allah wills we will kill those who worship stones in mecca and destroy the kaaba people go to mecca to touch the stones not for allah wherever they are in the world muslims are expected to face the kaaba whenever they are praying yet these deadly serious terrorists apparently want to destroy it isis reportedly is planning to take over the city of arar in saudi arabia which is very close to the iraq border from there it is only a 15hour drive to mecca isis is believed to have accumulated up to 2 billion in cash that was taken from banks in cities it now controls and from the sale of oil in addition isis also has a large stockpile of weapons and ammunition taken from iraqs military facilities and elsewhere in the northwest it is widely believed that isis has its sights set on taking control of baghdad iraqs capital with a population of over seven million some analysts feel that isis is not capable of taking control of baghdad due to its size lets hope this is true if isis were to control the iraqi government then it would control the oil and iraq exported apprx 24 million barrels per day in 2013 if those exports are disrupted that could cause an explosion in oil prices stay tuned why isis should worry americans europeans while isis is growing rapidly most analysts agree that its number is still around 10000 fighters and they are located in a relatively small geographic area in northwestern iraq and eastern syria if the us was of a mind to it could take out much of this terrorist group with drones andor targeted air strikes not to worry right yet president obama has refused to take any meaningful action against isis despite the significant threat it poses to the middle east – and ultimately the us never mind that many us soldiers lost their lives liberating these same iraqi cities that isis now controls the worst part is that intelligence experts estimate that isis may have up to 3000–4000 foreign fighters many of whom came from europe and the united states those who carry american passports

limited amounts mentioned can enable terrorist groups with the availability of the required expertise to use it separately or in combination with other materials in its terrorist acts said alhakim

little choice but to make the public appearance his declaration of a caliphate or islamic state was criticized by many rivals both for his haste in doing so and for disobeying al qaeda leader ayman alzawahiri who was opposed to the idea others criticized his reticence to appear before the people he was claiming to rule his appearance is being seen as a show of confidence and strength indeed the fact that he was able to make such a public appearance at mosuls great mosque in front of scores of worshippers in what was once iraqs second city was an effective demonstration of how secure islamist

arguably the most capable force fighting president bashar alassad inside syria isis is led by the shadowy abu bakr albaghdadi and backed by thousands of islamist fighters in syria and iraq many of them westerners and other foreign jihadists and it appears to be surpassing al qaeda as the worlds most dangerous terrorist group western governments fear it could eventually emulate al qaeda and strike overseas but their biggest worry for now is likely the eventual return home of foreign fighters attracted by isis and baghdadi among them are men like mehdi nemmouche a 29yearold frenchman who allegedly carried out a deadly shooting on a jewish museum in belgium last month after spending a year fighting with isis in syria working towards islamic emirate the soufan group a new yorkbased consultancy estimates that 12000 foreign fighters have traveled to syria including 3000 from the west and isis appears to have the greatest appeal with kings college london professor peter neumann

and compared with al qaedas franchise in syria al nusra front it has lower entry barriers isis has also sought to appeal to nonarabs recently publishing two englishlanguage magazines having already released videos in english or with english subtitles the jihadist group claims to have had fighters from the britain france germany and other european countries as well as the united states and from the arab world and the caucasus much of the appeal also stems from baghdadi himself the isis leader is touted as a battlefield commander and tactician a crucial distinction compared with al qaeda chief ayman alzawahiri for the last 10 years or more zawahiri has been holed up in the afghanistanpakistan border area and hasnt really done very much more than issue a few statements and videos said richard barrett a former counterterrorism chief at mi6 britains foreign intelligence service whereas baghdadi has done an amazing amount he has captured cities he has mobilised huge amounts of people he is killing ruthlessly throughout iraq and syria if you were a guy who wanted action you would go with baghdadi barrett told afp baghdadi apparently joined the insurgency that erupted in iraq soon after the 2003 usled invasion in october 2005 american forces said they believed they had killed abu dua one of baghdadis known aliases in a strike on the iraqsyria border but that appears to have been incorrect as he took the reins of what was then known as the islamic state of iraq or isi in may 2010 after two of its chiefs were killed in a usiraqi raid isi was al qaedas official branch in that country but after engaging in the syrian civil war against zawahiris explicit instructions and then threatening to alienate public support through his extremely brutal tactics the newlynamed isis was disowned by the al qaeda chief since then details about baghdadi have slowly trickled out bearded man with a suit and tie in october 2011 the us treasury designated him as a terrorist in a notice that said he was born in the iraqi city of samarra in 1971 and earlier this year iraq released a picture they said was of baghdadi the first from an official source depicting a balding bearded man in a suit and tie at the time baghdadi took over his group appeared to be on the ropes after the surge of us forces combined with the shifting allegiances of sunni tribesmen to deal him a blow but the group has bounced back expanding into syria in 2013 baghdadi sought to merge with alnusra which rejected the deal and the two groups have operated separately since more recently the two have engaged in armed clashes against one another as rebel groups joined forces to eject isis from syria rebels accuse isis of serving the syrian regimes agenda the group has embittered its rivals through its ruthless monopolization of territory attacking rebel forces and killing several prominent rebel leaders in its quest to establish its islamic state despite losing some territory to syrian rebels isis has consolidated its control over areas still under its control and middle east expert aymenn altamimi observed that previous conservative estimates of the groups strength were clearly vastly underestimating its capabilities speaking to the washington post tamimi noted that isiss ability to brush aside americantrained iraqi security forces in mosul at the same time as it is fighting on several other fronts in syria against rebels kurdish militias and syrian regime forces proves its manpower is far greater than the 10000 fighters it is widely reported to posses and speaking to arutz sheva yesterday he said its continued success should sound alarm bells if it turns out isis have taken exclusive control without sharing with other groups then this is very significant it means massive expansion of power and resources so in short they are just getting stronger and stronger category islam created on wednesday 25 december 2013 1756 a car bomb targeted a church in the iraqi

behind a country that is far from stable wallowing in a political stalemate and a widening sectarian chasm between the countrys shia majority and sunni minority under saddam husseins rule the sunni minority which comprises around 40 of the iraqi population was empowered at the expense of the shia majority since saddams ouster the countrys shia majority has risen to the top of iraqs political pile and many sunnis now complain of discrimination at the hands of authorities this along with the raging sectarian conflict in neighboring syria has fueled an al qaeda resurgence in iraq that has

conference a long harangue during which according to former un ambassador john bolton obama predictably blamed not the morsi rioters but the egyptian military again revealing this presidents egregious and systemic support for the muslim extremists who wish to turn egypt into an islamic republic nor did obama castigate fully the promorsi thugs who turned their savagery upon the hapless embattled coptic christian community it is estimated that perhaps as many as 50 churches and christian establishments were burned to the ground during the muslim antichristian pogrom this after copts have been beheaded in the streets of cairo and still the vatican and world christendom remain in the main deathly silent for decades ever since the secular revolution of gamal abdul nasser in 1954 successive egyptian presidents and governments have tried to crush the brotherhood this has been done by popular demand from the majority of egyptians obamas threats against the military thus fly in the face of all reality his actions will most certainly act against the best interests of the west and particularly of the united states but there are many who believe that barack hussein obama is on track to tactically do just that – harm america economically politically and militarily and not by incompetence but by a planned and mendacious strategy after all did not obama promise that he would fundamentally transform america during morsis time in office it should be remembered that sexual assaults against women skyrocketed islamic discrimination against women in egypt under morsi echoed the horrors perpetrated against females under the taliban in afghanistan it encouraged genital mutilation among egyptian women opposed any moves to stop polygamy and rejected any rights for women to have equality in the distribution of inheritance and assets and still apart from a very few brave souls the feminists around the world have remained deathly silent and was there a word of censure by president obama not one peep remember too that the first public announcement morsi made was to call for war against israel and utter his vile insult – straight out of the koran – equating jews with monkeys and pigs but what did obama continue to do in the face of the muslim brotherhoods excesses why he showered the morsi government with f16 fighter bombers and 400 abrams tanks – all no doubt weapons that eventually could be turned against the jewish state according to the middle east media research institute memri egyptian cleric dr khaled said in an interview aired on alhafez tv via the internet on march 17 2013 described american foreign military aid this way if the islamic revolution declares a framework for dealing with the west and america – they will accept it kiss our hands and double the aid they give us we consider this aid to be jizya poll tax not regular aid they pay so that we will let them be the aid constitutes jizya all nonmuslims living under muslim control were forced over the centuries to pay the discriminatory jizya tax if they refused to convert to islam thus american aid to the morsi regime was considered just that by the muslim brotherhood according to a report by debka an intelligence organization which some commentators often respond to negatively whether with good reason or not president barack obama put in a call to egypts strongman defense minister gen abdelfattah elsissi debkafiles intelligence sources report the us president wanted to give the general a dressingdown much on the lines of the call he made to former president hosni mubarak in february 2011 the debka report continued realizing what was coming gen elsissi decided not to accept obamas call the anecdote shows that the military strongman is not only determined to avoid the pitfalls which brought mubarak down but is equally determined to keep the us administration from interfering in his plans for driving the muslim brotherhood out of egyptian politics elsissi has a trump card that he will use against pressure from the obama administration saudiarabia has already begun to provide the financial support he needs to quell the muslim brotherhood whom the saudis loathe as do several of the gulf states all this will create another selfinduced foreign affairs nightmare for obama as an everwidening rift opens up between the rulers of the gulf states saudiarabia and the white house indeed according to debka our intelligence sources also disclose that while president obama was trying to get through to gen elsissi the general was on the phone with prince bandar director of saudi intelligence sadly israel unlike egypt doesnt possess alternate allies who can help buttress the jewish state from hostile pressure from the obama administration pressure which has forced the netanyahu government to timidly accede to obscene demands from the holocaust denying chairman of the socalled palestinian authority mahmoud abbas and from us secretary of state john kerry to release muslim monsters with jewish blood on their hands next to agree to enter into piece talks with the jew hating thugdom the pa that currently occupies parts of biblical and ancestral jewish judea and samaria calls have been made by myself and others in the opinion columns of arutz sheva for a push by israel to be made to create just such foreign alliances perhaps with india or china israel might not be faced with such intolerable pressures from such a presidency as that of barack obama if thought had been given to such a strategy much earlier notwithstanding the above it would be a salutary admonition to the netanyahu government to consider what winston churchill said during his fractious june 1940 cabinet discussions with then foreign minister lord halifax during those dark

during mass shot two priests and then blew themselves up when it was over 62 people were killed and 78 injured for many people in the united states news of this attack was their first exposure to the assyrian people whose history dates back to 4750 bc in mesopotamia according to biblical tradition they are the direct descendants of shem the son of noah the assyrians whose language evolved from akkadian to aramaic built the first cities and invented agriculture riverfed irrigation systems and establishment of the first library were among many other assyrian inventions that have shaped our world history ancient assyria with nineveh todays mosul as its capital city was once a feared kingdom from western persia into eastern egypt since the fall of nineveh in 612 bc to this day however assyrians have faced repeated ethnoreligious cleansing in the middle east having come to christ through the disciples thomas thaddeus and bartholomew in the first century ad assyrians realized a new enemy was on the horizon as islam spread throughout the region after 622 ad the first islamic attack was perpetrated against them in 650 ad when many monks were killed along the byzantine border the assyrians have since suffered attacks on a regular basis generation after generation after ottoman turkeys systematic killing of 750000 assyrians 15 million armenians and over 500000 greeks in the early 20th century many assyrians ended up in refugee camps since the ouster of iraqi president saddam hussein iraqiassyrian christians have endured vicious criminal acts by islamist extremists systematic ethnoreligious cleansing in iraq began in 2003 when christian families received threatening letters offering three options convert to islam pay the jizya a form of protection tax paid by nonmuslims or leave their homes emptyhanded as families started to receive the letters terrorists began systematically abducting and killing christian clergy to date there have been hundreds of christians who have been kidnapped and murdered because of their assyrian ethnicity and their christian faith these acts have driven approximately 1 million people out of their homeland where their ancestors had lived for thousands of years after these atrocities the assyrian nation once again finds itself in refugee camps in such countries as jordan turkey and syria waiting their turn to receive entry visas into western countries approximately 450000 assyrians have remained in their homeland preserving the aramaic language and centuriesold traditions with islamist rebels poised to take control of syria many iraqi christians who took refuge in that country are returning to iraq where they face more violence as christians have faced such calamities in muslimmajority countries throughout the middle east the christian west has remained silent mainstream news media have largely ignored the plight of iraqi christians part of the reason is that the victims are christians and do not fit the template of muslim and arab victimhood if such acts of violence had been directed at muslims activists in the west would rush to raise awareness and condemn the perpetrators as they did for the muslim victims of genocide in darfur if any news has been reported about iraqi christians it has come about mainly because of pressure from activists who flooded editors desks with news clips and press releases how is it that the christian world has forgotten what the blessed pope john paul ii called the right lung of the church how can church leaders recite the verses from st paul in 1 cor 1212 as a body is one though it has many parts and all the parts of the body though many are one body so also christ without cringing with guilt how can they read verse 26 if one part suffers all the parts suffer with it if one part is honored all the parts share its joy without weeping in shame how can christians declare themselves followers of christ when they forget about the church in regions where the body of christ is being recrucified when the dust settles after a church is bombed and when camera lights are turned off after an interview with the family of a kidnapped christian who is it that continues to care about those who are left behind the sad truth is that the aftermath in most cases is much harder to endure than the attack itself those who have survived are forced to live with the pain and the trauma for the rest of their days many survivors had thought their christian brothers and sister living in the west would rush to their aid but that help in most cases never came only silence for those who do not believe in the spirit of organized religion and may not want to lend a helping hand because this is happening to christians who may have deserved it for keeping their faith shouldnt they be outraged at this human rights tragedy the assyrians copts algerians and sudanese who choose to practice christianity are humans and deserve the attention that other groups receive when their rights to exist are violated this is an age of terrible uncertainty for a people that has existed for over 6700 years and is now on the verge of extinction in the aftermath of the

new pipeline as baghdad is working to get unesco to list babylon as a world heritage site archaeologists and oil ministry officials are in a battle over a pipeline that one side insists threatens the site and could cause irreparable damage to the ruins qais rashid head of the supreme board of antiquities and heritage said the oil ministry drilled to extend a pipeline that runs about 15 kilometers 09 miles in length to transport petroleum products through the archaeological site of babylon the pipeline was officially opened in march the work could damage priceless antiquities belonging to the modern era of babylon especially by drilling rashid said mariam omran head of the antiquities department in babil province where the site lies added that much of the archaeological area was still unexplored and while no damage was visible there was no telling what the impact was beneath the surface there may be antiquities just centimeters below the ground she said the antiquities at these sites have not yet been fully discovered just like the rest of the historical landmark but oil ministry spokesman assem jihad defended the babylon project saying it was carried out hundreds of meters yards from the archaeological sites we did not find any traces or evidence of the existence of antiquities during the drilling operations babylon lies some 90 kilometers 50 miles south of baghdad and is considered one of the cradles of human civilization it was the capital for two renowned kings of antiquity hammurabi 17921750 bc and nebuchadnezzar 604562 bc who built the hanging gardens the inner city covers an area of 299 square kilometers 115 square miles and the outer walls surrounding the city east and west of the euphrates enclose another 956 square kilometers 369 square miles listed as an archaeological site since 1935 it has been partially excavated over the past century but much of the ancient city remains to be uncovered a 2009 report from the un educational scientific and cultural organization unesco said the archaeological city was plundered during the usled war in 2003 that ousted saddam hussein contents of the nebuchadnezzar and hammurabi museums and of the babylon library and archive were stolen and destroyed and the city was damaged by digging cutting scraping and leveling for a us military base that was located there from april 2003 to december 2004 the ishtar gate and processional way were among key structures damaged the un agency said as american forces made key adaptations to the historical site to fortify their base by building trenches and pits and using chemicals to complete construction works iraq is a country rich in history and archaeological sites that offer great potential for tourism but the vast majority of government revenues still come from oil exports are rising rapidly averaging 2508 million barrels per day in april and pulling in 88 billion 68 billion euros with both figures at their highest levels since 1989 the sales are providing muchneeded income to help fund rebuilding of iraqs dilapidated infrastructure wracked by decades of war and sanctions there have been two pipelines to transport petroleum products in the same location for more than thirty years said jihad adding that the new strategic pipeline supplies oil products from refineries to the south of baghdad but rashid unfurled a map of the site across his desk in his office in iraqs national museum and said the pipeline passes via the northern edge of the site through the archaeological site and then through the southern edge he said the pipeline presented major risks including pollution of the environment and the threat of a potential explosion of the pipeline omran showed off a visible section of the pipeline which lies nearly two metres 65 feet underground the implementation of this project she said is an extreme violation of the law on the protection of antiquities iraq made three requests to establish bablyon as a unesco world heritage site under saddam husseins regime but all were rejected because the site was badly administered the organization said saddam did not properly care for the site even rebuilding part of the city with bricks stamped with his initials but rashid said unesco stressed that it is not only the former regime but the current regime in iraq that also does not respect the antiquities unesco told afp when asked about the pipeline that it will respond formally on this matter but gave no further details rashid however claimed that putting in the pipeline is like a bullet that killed our efforts to include the city of babylon as a world heritage site",
