the cruising level of passenger jets we dont have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height he said he said that the plane had apparently come down in an area of ukrainian military operations and that it was not out of the question that the ukrainians themselves shot it down remember the black sea plane disaster he said referring to the 2001 crash of a siberian airlines passenger jet bound for novosibirsk from tel aviv that the ukrainians shot down by accident during a military training exercise anton geraschenko an adviser at ukraines interior ministry said on his

            "text": "WASHINGTON — A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 with 295 people aboard was shot down over eastern Ukraine on Thursday by a surface-to-air missile, American officials have confirmed. The plane was traveling at about 30,000 feet, according to tracking information from a military spy satellite. The satellite was unable to detect where exactly the missile was fired.\n\nMilitary and intelligence analysts are using mathematical formulas, high-speed computers and other sensors to try to pin down the missile’s point of origin. Other analysts will work with the Ukrainian authorities to recover and analyze pieces of the missile and the aircraft to help determine what kind of missile was fired, the officials said.\n\nThe plane — Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — was carrying nearly 300 passengers and crew when it crashed and burned in an eastern Ukraine wheat field near the Russian border, in an area roiled by fighting between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces. There were no known survivors. Ukrainian officials immediately called the crash an act of terrorism.\n\nThe furiously unfolding investigation centered on Ukrainian separatists or Russian troops as the missile operators. Ukraine authorities said they have intercepted communications that prove separatist involvement.But the reason for the attack — whether it was a deliberate strike or a tragic accident — was unknown.\n\n“What we still don’t know is what were they thinking,” one official said.\n\n“This is truly a grave situation,” said Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. of the United States, speaking in Detroit. “It’s important we get to the bottom of this sooner than later because of the possible repercussions that can flow beyond from this, beyond the tragic loss of life.”\n\nUkraine’s president, Petro O. Poroshenko, called for an immediate investigation and asked the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, to send Dutch experts to assist. “I would like to note that we are calling this not an incident, not a catastrophe, but a terrorist act,” Mr. Poroshenko said.\n\nMalaysia’s prime minister, Najib Razak, said, “If it transpires that the plane was, indeed, shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must be brought to justice.”\n\nForensics evidence from the site, as well as the satellite data and any intercepted communications, would help analysts and investigators determine who fired the lethal missile.\n\nDefense Department officials said late Thursday that they were examining the possibility that Ukrainian separatists with Russian advisers had fired a captured Ukrainian Army Buk missile system. The separatists do not otherwise have the technology to shoot down an airliner at such a high altitude, the officials said.\n\nAnother possibility, a senior Pentagon official said, was that Russian troops just across the border from eastern Ukraine may have fired the missile. In both scenarios, the senior official said, the missile operator most likely mistook the Malaysian airliner for a Ukrainian military transport plane. A third possibility, the official said, was that the Russians supplied the rebels with the missile.\n\nTwo senior Pentagon officials said military analysts suspected that the missile was either an SA-11 or an SA-20.\n\nReporters arriving at the scene near the town of Grabovo described dozens of lifeless bodies strewn about, mostly intact, in a field dotted with purple flowers, with remnants of the plane scattered across a road lined with fire engines and emergency vehicles. “It fell down in pieces,” said one rescue worker as tents were set up to gather the dead.",

(Reuters)\n\nUkrainian intelligence has released audio from what it says were intercepted phonecalls between separatist rebels and Russian military intelligence officers, in which the separatists appeared to acknowledge shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 on Thursday.\n\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry sent reporters a link to the edited audio of the calls, with English subtitles, posted on YouTube by Ukraine’s intelligence agency, the State Security Service, known as the SBU.\n\nThe audio, purportedly recorded soon after the civilian jetliner with 295 people on board went down in the warzone close to the Ukraine’s border with Russia, added to Ukrainian and Western suspicions that pro-Russia separatists were culpable.\n\n \n\n American intelligence and military officials said the plane had been destroyed by a Russian SA-series missile, based on surveillance satellite data that showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile, but not its point of origin.\n\nThere were strong indications that those responsible may have errantly downed what they had thought was a military aircraft only to discover, to their shock, that they had struck a civilian airliner.\n\nRussia’s President Vladimir Putin blamed Kiev for creating what he called conditions for insurgency in eastern Ukraine. He did not specifically deny that a Russian-made weapon had felled the passenger jet.\n\nAccording to a translation of the Russian audio by the English-language Kyiv Post, the recording begins with a separatist commander, identified as Igor Bezler, telling a Russian military intelligence official, Vasili Geranin, “We have just shot down a plane.”\n\nIn a second audio clip, a man apparently at the scene of the crash is heard saying Cossack militiamen from the village of Chernukhino were responsible. “The plane fell apart in the air… We have found the first ‘200’,” a man described as “Major” in the subtitles, says, using what is apparently a code word for a dead person.\n\n“…It was definitely a civilian aircraft,” ‘Major’ says. “There are remains of internal brackets, seats and bodies.” Asked if there were any weapons in the debris, ‘Major’ replies: “Absolutely nothing. Civilian items, medical stuff, towels, toilet paper.”\n\nMyroslava Petsa, a Ukrainian journalist in Kiev, said that the people in the audio sounded shocked by what they had found in the wreckage.\n\nBy Thursday night, American intelligence analysts were increasingly focused on a theory that rebels had used a Russian-made SA-11 surface-to-air missile system to shoot down the aircraft and operated on their own fire-control radar, outside the checks and balances of the national Ukrainian air-defence network.\n\n(Separatist rebels who control the area said on Friday, meanwhile, that they had recovered most of the plane’s black boxes and were considering what to do with them, The Associated Press reported.

airplane crash but hopefully at least how the explosion occurred could be determined i think there had to have been a midair explosion since debris is widely scattered hopefully since the area is

honest i could be wrong of course the ukies dont have the knowhow to do any investigation plus they dont control the territory so the us and germans should make sure that the russians dont pull any

75938 pm 113 the ukrainian military has several batteries of buk surfacetoair missile systems with at least 27 launchers capable of bringing down highflying jets in the donetsk region where the malaysian passenger plane crashed russian defense ministry said read rts live updates on malaysian plane crash according to the russian defense ministry information units of the armed forces of ukraine located in the crashsite are equipped with antiaircraft missile systems of bukm1 these complexes in their tactical and technical characteristics are capable of detecting air targets at ranges of up to 160 kilometers and hit them at full altitude range at a distance of over 30 kilometers the ministrys statement reads as cited by ria earlier itartass and interfax news agencies were citing a source familiar with the issue who said that another battery of buk systems is currently being prepared for shipment to donetsk region from the ukrainian city of kharkov the donetsk region remains the scene of heavy fighting between government troops and the forces of the opposition which refused to recognize the regime change in kiev and demand federalization a malaysian airlines aircraft en route from amsterdam to malaysia crashed in eastern ukraine â not far from the russian border â on thursday chances are high that the malaysian plane was really downed by the ukrainian antiaircraft defense yury karash pilot and aviation expert told rt a boeing777 is an extremely reliable piece of machinery modern planes dont just crash with no reason he said let us recall how a ukrainian missile downed russian tu154 aircraft ten years ago i cant completely exclude the possibility the boeing777 was also hit by a missile i dont know who couldve shot it down but i can allege that it was most likely the ukrainian armed forces simply because its military â antiaircraft defense in particular â are unfortunately unqualified as judging by the overall state of the ukrainian armed forces insufficient attention has been paid to their training karash added reports in the western media hurried to blame the selfdefense forces of the peoples republic of donetsk for bringing the plane down the claims were denied by the representatives of the donetsk peoples republic saying that its the ukrainian military which destroyed the aircraft we simply dont have such air defense systems our manportable air defense systems have a firing range 3000 4000 meters the boeing was flying at a much higher altitude sergey kavtaradze special representative for the prime minister of the donetsk peoples republic explained kavtaradze also expressed condolences to the relatives of all of those who lost their lives in the tragedy ihs janes defense analyst nick de larrinaga also shared the belief that the selfdefense forces lack the capability to bring the malaysian plane down at normal cruising altitude a civilian passenger aircraft would be out of the range of the sort of manned portable air defense systems that we have seen proliferate in rebel hands in east ukraine he said in a statement but the aircraft would be within range of buk or other mediumrange surfacetoair missile systems he stressed both russia and ukraine have such sam systems in their inventories the expert added it seems unlikely that the selfdefense forces couldve used buk surfacetoair missile systems to down the malaysian plane retired brig gen kevin ryan the director of the defense and intelligence project at the belfer center for science and international affairs said it takes a lot of training and a lot of coordination to fire one of these and hit something he told cnn this is not the kind of weapon a couple of guys are going to pull out of a garage and fire according to ryan if the plane was really taken down then it was done by a professional military force httprtcomnews173636bukmalaysianplanecrash posted by brian jul 17 2014 80011 pm 114 110 most likely the us wants to get involved to gum up

1993 was shattered war resumed and masses of people were massacred the perpetrators of that attackthe rwandan patriotic front according to bruguiÃ¨reknew what would happen as did their principal backers the united states and the united kingdom unclassified internal clinton administration documents show that on that very night immediately after learning of president habyarimanas death prudence bushnell of the american embassy in kigali presciently wrote to secretary of state warren christopher in washington if as it appears both presidents have been killed there is a strong likelihood that widespread violence could break out in either or both countries particularly if it is confirmed that the plane was shot down a rigorous sixyear investigation now finally casts light on an event that changed the course of rwandanand central africanhistory and names names had the plane not been shot down the massacres might have been avoided the bruguiÃ¨re report is also particularly damning for many people who have shaped the narrative of the rwanda tragedy since 1994 among them kofi annan who in 1998 commissioned an independent inquiry into un actions during the 1994 genocide in rwanda in that very official report states at approximately 2030 habyarimana and president cyprien ntaryamira of burundi were killed in a plane crash just outside the kigali airport indictment documents produced by the international criminal tribunal for rwanda also calls it a plane crash two surface to air missiles were shot but the official un story was that the plane fell out of the sky that probably explains why the black box disappeared in un offices for 10 years the report is also damning for louise arbour recently appointed by kofi annan to head the un human rights commission in her capacity as chief prosecutor of the tribunal louise arbour nixed the only un sponsored investigation into the assassination of the rwandan president when investigator michael hourigan turned up evidence pointing to kagame and the rwandan patriotic front along with testimony from rpf members who had participated in the missile attack louise arbour though initially enthusiastic suppressed his findings and ordered him to go no further it is damning for former un mission commander general romeo dallaire first he provides no explanation for the disappearance of the planes cockpit voice recorder black box which surfaced this week at un headquarters dallaire was in charge of the socalled kigali weapons secure area from where the missile was shot secondly his 600page book does not even try to explain how the former rwandan president was killed and who did it worse still he continually refers to the assassination as an accident the report is damning for uganda and ugandan president yoweri museveni the missiles used to shoot down the plane were the property of the ugandan army uganda had been bought them from the soviet union in 1987 whereas the official story would have it that the tragedy in rwanda was an internal crisis the ownership of those missiles points directly to the fact that the socalled rpf rebels were ranking members of the ugandan army until the day they invaded rwanda on october 1 1990 paul kagame had been ugandas chief of military intelligence and benefited from ugandan until he took power in july 1994 the report is also very damning for united states and particularly the clinton administration who have supported paul kagame and the rwandan patriotic front unfailingly since the early 1990s how could a country supposedly so intent on fighting terrorism treat the assassination of two african heads of state so lightly that it never forced the un get to the bottom of it after all the washington has always gotten its way on rwanda at the un for instance when it was time to act in 1994 another unclassified state department document dated april 15 1994 states that for the united states the first priority of the un security council was to instruct the secretary general to implement an orderly withdrawal of allall unamir forces from rwanda that is exactly what the un did thus prompting former un secretary general boutrosghali to declare that the rwandan genocide was 100 percent american responsibility hopefully the 10th anniversary commemoration will be an opportunity find out more about why so many people died in rwanda and later in the congo moral indignation is fine but it can not replace hard facts judge bruguiÃ¨res report has uncovered some important facts that have been carefully edited out of the official story about in

horrible tragedy hundreds of lives lost and hundreds more devastated by the news just awful and unless i see strong evidence to the contrary this looks like an almighty cock up by the federalists rather than an almighty conspiracy by some other party it is quite astounding that commercial flights were still operating over the troubled region and i suspect that those who downed the 777 were as equally surprised to see what they thought was a military plane falling through the cloudy sky as a malaysian airliner if the kremlin comes to the same conclusion then expect this to be the trigger that reins in the federalists and i suspect that putin has his own suspicions about who did this from the comments he has already made this tragedy would not have happened if there had been peace on that land or in any case if military operations in southeastern ukraine had not been renewed he said in televised comments ie your aerial attacks forced them into making this mistake however there are admittedly a few elements to this incident that raise suspicion it truly internationalises a localised battle that pitted the russians against the ukrainians one that the ukrainians would not win alone when ukrainian military planes were being shot out of the sky international reaction seemed apathetic imagine the fury that ukrainian officials were experiencing to the loss of men and international interest the almost instantaneous publication of intercepted phone conversations with useful mug shots of those talking accompanying the recording is suspicious if this has been fabricated why are ukrainian authorities to be trusted furthermore the netherlands is by far russias largest export partner at a time when enemies of russia wish to see the economic screw turned tighter the loss of 150 dutch nationals to alleged russian involvement will certainly cause russian imports to tumble off the back of antirussian sentiment in the netherlands as well as breaking down strong dutch opposition to tougher eu sanctions posted by pat bateman jul 18 2014 45552 am 192 httpniqnaqwordpresscom20140718crazyivanaskedmetolookupthiswhatidescribedasnatoopensasituationroomforukraineoperations the substantive point can not be obscured this is a nato facility it is now as of jul 12 six days ago officially open and large sums are allocated to its function whatever that is i suggest that its real function is not just to conduct information warfare against russia but that it is a serious electronic war room and that its first project has been controlling the malaysia airliner operation this has been conducted more or less on the model of the 1983 korean airlines flight 007 which was intentionally directed into soviet airspace so that it would be shot down but it is important to hang on to the fact that in todays case it was the dpr who were known to have buk and to have used it who were intended to perform the shootdown as indeed i believe they did therefore to blame russia for it is pure misdirection the intended target of the operation is the dpr who can now

missile before it crashed and burned on thursday in an eastern ukraine wheat field near the russian border crash site within area of rebel activity eastern ukraine has been roiled for months by a violent prorussian separatist uprising a number of military aircraft have been downed the plane went down in an area roiled by fighting between prorussian separatists and ukrainian forces and ukrainian officials called the crash an act of terrorism vice president joe biden speaking in detroit seemed to support that conclusion when he said the passenger plane had been blown out of the sky ukraines president petro o poroshenko said in a statement that he was calling for an immediate investigation of the crash of the plane which was en route to kuala lumpur malaysia from amsterdam there were no reported survivors among the 280 passengers and 15 crew members mr poroshenko said he had called the dutch prime minister mark rutte to express his condolences and invite dutch experts to assist in the investigation i would like to note that we are calling this not an incident not a catastrophe but a terrorist act mr poroshenko said malaysias prime minister najib razak called thursday evening for an investigation at the crash site and the unfettered cooperation of local authorities noting that ukrainian officials had reported that the plane was hit by a missile he said malaysia is unable to verify the cause of this tragedy no stone will be left unturned he added if it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down we insist that the perpetrators must be brought to justice reporters arriving at the scene near the town of grabovo described dozens of lifeless bodies strewn about mostly intact in a field dotted with purple flowers with remnants of the plane scattered across a road lined with fire engines and emergency vehicles it fell down in pieces said one rescue worker as tents were set up to gather the dead an armed prorussian separatist at the site of a malaysia airlines boeing 777 plane crash on thursday in the donetsk region of ukraine credit maxim zmeyevreuters one passenger in a black sweater lay on her back with blood streaming down her face and her left arm raised the carcass of the plane was still smoldering and rescue workers moved through the dark field with flashlights dogs barked in the distance and the air was filled with a bitter smell a regional airline official said the plane had been flying at about 33000 feet when radar lost track of it for months eastern ukraine has been the scene of a violent prorussian separatist uprising in which a number of military aircraft have been downed but this would be the first commercial airline disaster to result from the hostilities despite the turmoil in eastern ukraine the commercial airspace over that part of the country is heavily trafficked and has remained open aeroflot russias national carrier announced that it had suspended all flights to ukraine for at least three days malaysia airlines still reeling from the mysterious loss of another boeing 777 flight in march said it had lost contact with thursdays flight mh17 over ukraine but offered no further details immediately mr razak said initially in a twitter post that he was shocked by reports that an mh plane crashed we are launching an immediate investigation president obama who one day earlier had announced strengthened sanctions against russia over its support for the eastern ukraine separatists spoke by telephone with president vladimir v putin of russia and mr putin raised the issue of the reports of the downed plane white house officials said josh earnest the white house press secretary said mr obama had been briefed about the plane crash later mr obama said the united states government was working to determine whether any americans had been aboard the flight russias interfax news agency said there had been no russians aboard there was no immediate word from the kremlin about the substance of the obamaputin telephone call the kremlin put out a short statement saying that mr putin had a previously scheduled telephone conversation with mr obama the parties had a detailed discussion about the crisis in ukraine the statement said mr putin repeated the need for an immediate ceasefire and objected to what he said was ukrainian army fire striking inside russia russian news agencies said mr putin also spoke by telephone to the president of malaysia and offered his condolences mr rutte the dutch prime minister said in a statement said he was deeply shocked by the crash a lot remains unclear about the reason circumstances and those on board he said i have just called with the ukrainian president the dutch state news agency quoted tour operator wtcnl as saying that around 20 to 30 dutch and belgian citizens had been on board andrei purgin deputy prime minister of the donetsk peoples republic the insurgent group in eastern ukraine denied in a telephone interview that the rebels had anything to do with the loss of the passenger jet he said that the rebels had shot down ukrainian planes before but that their antiaircraft weapons could reach only to around 4000 meters far below the cruising level of passenger jets we dont have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height he said he said that the plane had apparently come down in an area of ukrainian military operations and that it was not out of the question that the ukrainians themselves shot it down remember the black sea plane disaster he said referring to the 2001 crash of a siberian airlines passenger jet bound for novosibirsk from tel aviv that the ukrainians shot down by accident during a military training exercise anton geraschenko an adviser at ukraines interior ministry said on his facebook page that the malaysia airlines plane had been brought down by a russianmade buk or beech antiaircraft system russian missile systems are named for trees a reference book published by rosoboronexport the russian state weapons export monopoly describes the buk antiaircraft missile system as designed to target both low and highflying aircraft to a maximum height of 72000 feet mr geraschenko wrote that earlier thursday people in eastern ukraine supporting the central government had reported seeing a buk system moved from the town of torez toward the town of snezhnoye a commander of a rebel unit in donetsk said we could have shot down three planes over donetsk yesterday but we didnt because they could have been civilians he said the rebel forces did not have the buk system in comments broadcast on ukrainian television vitali klitschko the mayor of kiev and former heavyweight boxing champion said the crash illustrated the risks to peace in europe of the fighting in eastern ukraine this is not just a local conflict in donetsk and luhansk but a fullscale war in the center of europe he said im certain the international community this time will pay attention and understand correction july 17 2014 an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of ukraines president he is petro o poroshenko not poroschenko correction july 17 2014 an earlier version of this article misstated the title of najib razak he is the prime minister not president of malaysia the article also misstated the direction a siberian airlines passenger jet was flying before it was shot down by ukraine in 2001 it was flying from israel not to it neil macfarquhar and david m herszenhorn reported from moscow and rick gladstone from new york reporting was contributed by sabrina

flowered wheat field thursday in a part of eastern ukraine controlled by prorussia separatists blown out of the sky at 33000 feet by what ukrainian and us officials described as a russianmade antiaircraft missile ukraine accused the separatists of carrying out what it called a terrorist attack us intelligence and military officials said the plane had been destroyed by a russian saseries missile based on surveillance satellite data that showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not its point of origin there were strong indications that those responsible may have errantly downed what they had thought was a military aircraft only to discover to their shock that they had struck a civilian airliner everyone aboard was killed their corpses littered among wreckage that was still smoldering late into the summer night russias president vladimir putin blamed ukraines government for he said creating the conditions for the insurgency in eastern ukraine where separatists have bragged about shooting down at least three ukrainian military aircraft but putin did not specifically deny that a russianmade weapon had felled the malaysian jetliner whatever the cause the news of the crashed plane with a passenger manifest that spanned at least nine countries elevated the insurgency into a new international crisis the day before the united states had slapped new sanctions on russia for its support of the prokremlin insurgency that has brought eastwest relations to their lowest point in many years making the crash even more of a shock it was the second time within months that malaysia airlines had suffered a masscasualty flight disaster with international intrigue — and with the same model plane a boeing 777200er prime minister najib razak of malaysia — whose government is still reeling from the unexplained disappearance of flight 370 in march somewhere over the indian ocean — said he was stupefied at the news of flight 17 which had been bound for kuala lumpur from amsterdam with 283 passengers including three infants and 15 crew members aviation officials said the aircraft had been traveling an approved and heavily trafficked route over eastern ukraine about 20 miles from the russia border when it vanished from radar screens at 1015 am edt with no distress signal this is a tragic day in what has already been a tragic year for malaysia najib told reporters in a televised statement from kuala lumpur if it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice najib said he had spoken with the leaders of ukraine and the netherlands who promised their cooperation he also said that he had spoken with president barack obama and that he and i both agreed that the investigation must not be hindered in any way the remark pointed to concerns about evidence tampering at the crash site which is in an area controlled by prorussia insurgents obama and putin also spoke about the disaster and the broader ukraine crisis white house officials said and putin expressed his condolences to malaysia but in a statement quoted by russias ria novosti news agency putin said this tragedy would not have happened if there was peace in the country if military operations had not resumed in the southeast of ukraine the united nations security council is scheduled to meet on the ukraine crisis this morning adding to ukrainian and western suspicions that prorussia separatists were culpable ukraines intelligence agency the state security service known as the sbu released what it said was audio from intercepted phone calls between separatist rebels and russian military intelligence officers on thursday in the audio the separatists appeared to acknowledge shooting down a civilian plane the ukrainian foreign ministry sent reporters a link to the edited audio of the calls with english subtitles posted on youtube by the sbu by thursday night us intelligence analysts were increasingly focused on a theory that rebels had used a russianmade sa11 surfacetoair missile system and operated on their own firecontrol radar — outside the checks and balances of the national ukrainian airdefense network — to shoot down the aircraft everything we have and it is not much says separatists a senior pentagon official told the new york times that said theres still a lot of conjecture russian troops who have been deployed along the eastern ukraine border have similar sa11 systems as well as larger weapons known as sa20s pentagon officials said petro poroshenko ukraines president said he had called the dutch prime minister mark rutte to express his condolences and to invite dutch experts to assist in the investigation i would like to note that we are calling this not

fighter on wednesday but this would be the first commercial airline disaster to result from the hostilities despite the turmoil the commercial airspace over eastern ukraine is heavily trafficked and has remained open questions are likely to be raised in the coming days about why the traffic line which is controlled by ukraine and russia was not closed earlier with the news of the disaster on thursday the ukrainian authorities declared the eastern part of the country a nofly zone us and european carriers rerouted their flights and aeroflot russias national carrier announced that it had suspended all flights to ukraine for at least three days the conspicuous exception was aeroflot flights to crimea the southern peninsula annexed by russia in march a pivotal point in the ukraine

separate routes around a world where armed conflict is always occurring somewhere as companies send business travelers on assignments that often venture into — and even more often over — dangerous areas employers have become ever more cognizant of a legal and ethical issue called duty of care this means basically that employers need to take reasonable precautions to ensure a safe working environment for travelers as it is described in a 2012 report duty of care are you covered by the corporate riskmanagement and security company ijet this includes evaluating security conditions in destination countries knowing their employees whereabouts and keeping in contact continue reading the main story related coverage but the shooting down of malaysia airlines flight 17 last thursday near the troubled eastern ukraine border which killed 298 people could add a new factor for employers to consider and has considerable implications for companies and businesstravel managers responsible for duty of care said greeley koch the executive director of the association of corporate travel executives will it now be necessary for travel departments to make sure that preferred carriers do not overfly war zones areas of civil conflict or regions of crisis photo credit chi birmingham that of course would be a tall order but the downing of the commercial airliner evidently by a sophisticated military surfacetoair missile capable of hitting planes at high altitudes underlines growing complexities in dutyofcare matters while obviously no airline or company deliberately puts people at risk sometimes new risks are identified and steps have to be taken mr koch said it isnt clear what those steps might be but travel managers have told the association that they are evaluating the specific airtravel issues raised by the flight 17 disaster top among these are questions about the prudence of flying over a troubled region where combatants had recently shot down a ukrainian military transport plane at about 21000 feet while there had been international aviation prohibitions on flying over crimea farther south the operative orders for the area where flight 17 was downed said that the route was safe for flying — at over 32000 feet flight 17 bound from amsterdam to kuala lumpur was at 33000 feet on a standard airway heavily used until recently by hundreds of flights between northern europe and asia this is a wellestablished international route said anthony c roman a security consultant who is also a former commercial pilot and flight instructor its regularly traversed by other airlines however in april the european aviation authorities issued warnings to member states that the crimea area should be avoided in may the faa actually restricted flights over crimea itself and warned about eastern ukraine continue reading the main story a malaysia airlines flight with nearly 300 people aboard crashed in eastern ukraine near the russian border on thursday open graphic he added airlines often decide its the smartest route the most available route the route is legally available and as long as its legally available we will fly it or likely its a combination of these things as to corporate duty of care mr roman points out managers planning employee travel have no prior knowledge of the routings of particular aircraft which are determined by airline dispatchers subject to inflight modifications by captain and airtraffic control including for weather or congestion and given the growing overlapping routes caused by growing consolidation in global airline alliances it may not even be immediately apparent which airline is even flying the plane malaysia flight 17 for example was also a code share for klm flight 4103 — and most of the passengers on the plane were dutch citizens who had most likely booked through klm airlines rerouting around ukraine airspace face tough choices and potential controversy on sunday for example flightradar24 the realtime global flighttracking service showed that malaysia airlines flight 4 from kuala lumpur to london an a380 capable of carrying 494 passengers flew over syria rather than taking its usual route over ukraine a year ago the federal aviation administration warned american carriers of a potential danger in syrian skies from surfacetoair missiles continue reading the main story among the 298 people aboard malaysia airlines flight 17 were a renowned aids researcher a dutch senator and an australian novelist airlines now avoid ukraines skies maps on flightradar24com show ukraine as a vast hole within the airtraffic network in europe russia and asia on monday for example only a handful of commercial flights were over ukraine all of them on approach or departure from boryspil international airport near kiev which is 350 miles west of the flight 17 crash site near donetsk in eastern ukraine radar showed a narrow river of flights bowing along the western russian border with ukraine and over the black sea and a very broad river of flights to the west of ukraine between europe the mediterranean and asia reacting to the flight 17 disaster some airlines rushed to announce that they had not been flying over ukraine for some time — but flightradar24com posted on twitter right after the malaysia crash that several airlines that have been tracked over ukraine as late as yesterday claim they have been avoiding ukraine for months flightradar24 did not name those airlines over the weekend finnair had to backtrack after it was called out on social media for claiming that finnair does not fly over ukraine your safety is our top priority flightradar24 data showed that the airline was in fact flying over western ukraine in recent days finnair subsequently conceded that flightradar24 was correct and said it had stopped flying over ukraine email jsharkeynytimescom more on nytimescom site index",

up in a familiar phrase its complicated the tugofwar over ukraine threatens to derail japanese prime minister shinzo abes moves toward rapprochement with russia relations between japan and russia have suffered for decades due to a territorial dispute that has prevented the signing of a peace treaty after world war ii yet japan must toe the line on sanctions it can not spurn its main ally the us nor european partners it also has good reason to stand strong against russias apparent support for prorussian insurgents who have destabilized swaths of eastern ukraine given the parallels with chinas ambitions toward disputed japanesecontrolled islands in the east china sea japans chief government spokesman offered only vague support thursday for the coordinated american and european moves targeting russian energy firms financial institutions arms suppliers and four individuals we are watching the situation of the eu and us chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said at a regular briefing working with the international community is our stance regarding ukraine so we would like to take appropriate measures in line with that attitude his terse reply says plenty about japans ambivalence over the issue limited sanctions japan has imposed sanctions on russia but in a very limited way it has suspended bilateral talks on some issues and imposed an entry visa ban on 23 individuals whom it hasnt publicly named japan is really signaling to russia that its not fully committed to the sanctions its going along but wants to keep a balanced position said james d j brown a political science professor at temple universitys japan campus in tokyo the visa ban apparently doesnt apply to sergey naryshkin who as chairman of the lower house of russias parliament was sanctioned by the us and eu after russia annexed crimea he visited japan last month to inaugurate a cultural festival where he delivered a message from putin praising the event as a way of enhancing our mutual trust naryshkin also dined with former japanese prime minister yoshiro mori who had been shuttling between tokyo and moscow as an unofficial envoy having declared resolution of the territorial dispute his lifelong duty a visit by russian president vladimir putin to japan planned for the fall appears to be still in the works the energy and china factors tokyo is wary about beijing cozying up to moscow said valerie niquet a senior research fellow at the foundation for strategic research in paris tokyo remains interested in rapprochement with russia to balance beijing she said energy is one vital bond japanese and russian companies are pushing ahead with projects including a liquefied natural gas facility in sakhalin to increase shipments to japan and other asian countries the russians are not open at all to accepting a lot of investments from china including in energy so theyve built a strong working relationship with japan niquet said putin has also obliged abe by remaining neutral on the islands in the east china sea that are claimed by both tokyo and beijing territorial conundrum despite those shared interests it is unclear if japan and russia can bridge their dispute over four islands just off the northern tip of hokkaido the russians captured the islands at the end of world war ii but they are claimed by japan and a pet cause of japanese nationalists brown noted that given russias insistence on protecting russian speakers in crimea it seems unlikely that moscow would give up sovereignty over islands populated mostly by russian speakers 6 obama putin discuss

washington ap ― president barack obama said thursday that the passenger plane downed over ukraine looks like it may be a terrible tragedy and his top priority is finding out whether american citizens were on board obama said hes directed his aides to stay in close contact with ukrainian officials and offer us help to determine what caused the crash ukrainian president petro poroshenko called the downing of the malaysia airlines plane carrying 295 people an act of terrorism an associated press journalist counted at least 22 bodies at the crash site about 25 miles from the russian border where government and promoscow separatists have been fighting anton gerashenko an adviser to ukraines interior minister said on his facebook page that the plane was flying at an altitude of 33000 feet when it was hit by a missile fired from a buk launcher obama press secretary josh earnest said obama was on a phone call with russian president vladimir putin when news of the downed plane broke earnest and the kremlin said putin mentioned those early reports in the call but provided no details of what the two leaders said about it the world is watching reports of a downed passenger jet near the russiaukraine border obama said later as he took the stage for a speech in delaware to discuss transportation funding it looks like it might be a terrible tragedy right now were working to determine whether there were american citizens on board that is our first priority shortly after obama spoke earnest said vice president joe biden spoke by phone with poroshenko to offer us assistance to help

is known and what has been claimed the cause us officials and an adviser to ukraines interior minister have said a surfacetoair missile brought down malaysia airlines flight 17 as it flew thursday from amsterdam to kuala lumpur all 298 people aboard died us ambassador samantha power told the un security council in new york on friday the missile was likely fired from a rebelheld area near the russian border independent aviation experts have agreed a missile was the likely cause but so far theres been no proof ukraines government the prorussia rebels who oppose it and russia have all denied shooting down the passenger plane the official investigation into the crash and its cause has only begun the black boxes the whereabouts of the planes flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder remained unknown friday the rebels gave conflicting reports about whether they had found them russias foreign minister said his country had no intention of acquiring them and that they should be given to international aviation organizations some experts in air accident investigations said the boxes contents could be key to establishing what happened to the boeing 777 in the moments before it crashed the thud of a missile hit or the acoustic shock wave emitted by an explosion could have been picked up by the cockpit recorder they said however us aviation safety expert john goglia said he doesnt think the black boxes will yield a great deal of evidence on the cause of the crash since the operation of the plane doesnt appear to be an issue in the incident the investigation according to international civil aviation regulations ukraine should take the lead in investigating an air crash on its territory ukraine has called for an international probe and the united states has offered to assist but access to the site in rebelheld lands 40 kilometers 25 miles from the russian border remained difficult and dangerous friday it was still uncertain whether the rebels would allow ukrainian

obama points to prorussia separatists in downing of malaysia airlines plane washington ― president obama said friday that the united states believed the malaysia airlines jetliner felled over eastern ukraine had been shot down by a surfacetoair missile from an area inside ukraine controlled by russianbacked separatists he demanded a prompt international inquiry as signs emerged that separatists were impeding an assessment of the crash site by outside monitors mr obamas remarks at the white house were the strongest public suggestions yet from the united states of who was responsible for the downing of the plane which exploded crashed and burned on thursday on farmland in eastern ukraine killing all 298 people aboard mr obama said the loss of life was an outrage of unspeakable proportions and a global tragedy he vowed to investigate exactly what had happened to end the lives of men women children infants who had nothing to do with the crisis in the region he also said that at least one american was among the dead we are going to make sure the truth is out mr obama said referring to what he described as a trove of misinformation that had already shrouded the plane crash continue

said the violence in the region must not obstruct an independent investigation of the planes destruction and he called on russia ukraine and the russianbacked separatists to agree to an immediate ceasefire evidence must not be tampered with mr obama said investigators need to access the crash site and the solemn task of returning those who were lost onboard the plane to their loved ones needs to go forward immediately while separatists guarding the crash site allowed some ukrainian government rescue teams to enter and begin collecting bodies they were less cooperative with a team of monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe who wanted to secure a safe route for the investigation and salvaging operations reuters quoted thomas greminger chairman of the osces permanent council in vienna as saying that armed separatists had prevented the monitors from gaining full access to the site in the current circumstances they were not able to help securing this corridor that would allow access for those that would want to investigate he was quoted as saying there were reports that some separatists had fired at the monitors but the osce said in a twitter message that those claims were untrue mr obama spoke after samantha power the american ambassador to the united nations told an emergency security council meeting on the ukraine conflict that there was credible evidence that prorussia separatists and their russian associates in eastern ukraine were responsible for the crash the malaysia airlines boeing 777200 ― flight 17 from amsterdam to kuala lumpur malaysia ― was at a cruising altitude of 33000 feet on a commonly used air route over eastern ukraine when it was struck on thursday both russia and the separatist groups deny any responsibility and some rebel leaders suggest that ukraines armed forces may have shot down the plane president vladimir v putin of russia has implicitly blamed ukraines government saying it created the conditions for the separatist uprising that has escalated into a major crisis but mr putin has not denied that a russianmade weapon may have destroyed the aircraft mr obama resisted blaming mr putin personally saying that the united states did not know who had fired the missile but he made clear that he held the russians responsible for failing to stop the violence that made the downing

we know that they are heavily armed and they are trained mr obama said that is not an accident that is happening because of russian support he said it was not possible for these separatists to be functioning the way they are without russian support he said that the loss of the plane was a direct result of the fighting in the region and that the violence had been facilitated in large part because of russian support mr obama said mr putin could decide not to allow heavy armaments or troops to flow across the border from russia into ukraine if mr putin does that he said then it will stop

american accusations of russian support vitaly i churkin russias united nations ambassador declined to comment the 15member security council called unanimously for a full thorough and independent international investigation into the cause of the crash jeffrey d feltman the united nations under secretary general for political affairs told the council that 80 children were among the dead ms powers assertions were echoed by two senior defense department officials who said the pentagon and american intelligence agencies had concluded that an sa11 missile fired from an area near the russia border had downed the plane that conclusion was based on an analysis of the launch plume and trajectory of the missile as detected by an american military spy satellite the analysis did not pinpoint the origin of the missile or identify who launched it but a senior defense department official said the americans believed the missile had been launched from several kilometers inside the ukrainian

information on mh17 from various sources around the web corbett report members are encouraged to debate and discuss the situation in the commments thread below ask questions suggest links and otherwise contribute to this investigation the article will be updated with information as the investigation continues not a corbett report member sign up today general information on mh17 via aviationsafetynet a boeing 777200 passenger plane operating malaysia airlines flight 17 crashed in the ukraine east of donetsk all 298 on board were killed flight mh17 departed the gate at amsterdamschiphol airport the netherlands at 1214 hours local time bound for kuala lumpur malaysia it was airborne at 1230 1030 utc from runway 36c and reached a cruising altitude of fl310 at 1253 1053 utc ninety minutes into the flight at 1201 utc and just prior to entering ukrainian airspace the flight climbed to fl330 this altitude was maintained until last contact by adsb receivers of flight tracking websites about 1321 utc at the point of last contact it was flying 1000 feet above airspace that had been restricted as a result of ongoing fighting in the area malaysia airlines reported that mh17 filed a flight plan requesting fl350 throughout ukrainian airspace however the flight was instructed by ukrainian air traffic control to fly at fl330 flight path via zerohedge perhaps the best visualization of what the issue is comes from vagelis karmiros who has collated all the recent mh17 flight paths as tracked by flightaware and shows that while all ten most recent paths pass safely well south of the donetsk region and cross the zone above the sea of azov it was only todays tragic flight that passed straight overhead donetsk via new york times a survey of flights to asia from europe in the last week found that some airlines had been flying over eastern ukraine and some had been avoiding the area source flight path data from flightradar24com responsibility for the crash ukraines position itartass reported in june that donetsk defense forces seized buk missile defence systems from an army unit operating in the region a point repeated and echoed by nato supreme allied commander europe general philip breedlove in a pentagon press briefing on june 30 however this was directly contradicted on july 18th by ukrainian prosecutorgeneral vitaly yarema who told ukrainian pravda that militias do not have access to buk delivery systems or s300s on july 19 ukrainian intelligence posted what they claim to be intercepted communications showing russian responsibility for the downing of mh17 along with an english transcript numerous alternative media sources claim that the creation timestamp on the video indicates it was created before the crash took place ukraine also claims that a post appeared on the social media account of rebel commander igor strelkov exactly 35 minutes after the crash appearing to take credit for the downing subsequent reporting however pointed out that the post was ambiguously worded and the social media account in question may not be run by strelkov at all the ukraine security service also published a video on july 18th purporting to show the actual buk missile launcher used to bring down the plane being shuttled back across the border from ukraine to russia despite the fact that there is no confirmation from any source when where or how this video was taken or whether it in fact shows a buk system on a russian transport vehicle it has been uncritically reported on in much of the western press alternative positions in a statement issued late in the day on july 17th russian president putin said i want to note that this tragedy would not have happened if there were peace on this land if the military actions had not been renewed in southeast ukraine and certainly the state over whose territory this occurred bears responsibility for this awful tragedy a report originally posted to rtcom shortly after the downing suggested that the real target of the missile might have been president putins plane which was said to have been scheduled to fly over the exact same airspace as mh17 less than an hour after it was shot down this claim has since been retracted and rt has noted that putin has been avoiding ukrainian airspace altogether since the recent coup took place in kiev according to a report circulating widely in the alternative media a spanish air traffic controller working in the ukraine on the 17th tweeted a series of messages indicating that the ukrainian military shot down the flight and that kiev authorities and foreigners subsequently took over the civilian air traffic control center overseeing the disputed airspace in an apparent coverup the twitter account spainbuca of the alleged air traffic controller carlos was then reportedly removed update global research is now reporting that this story is likely fake and that sources indicate the tweets were being sent out of london some researchers suggest that the timing of the disaster coming as it does right after putin heralded the beginning of the longawaited brics development bank is more than coincidental this theory posits that the crash was staged by the useunato or other powers as part of a proxy war taking place in the new cold war between russia one of the key players in an organization that is seen as a key rival to the socalled washington consensus institutions the imf and the world bank and the us some have suggested that the takedown of mh17 was also related to the six passengers on board who were heading to an aids conference in melbourne hosted by the international aids society the theory holds that the researchers were going to question the origins of aids and were taken out in a similar manner to dr jonathan mann yet others point to the numerology of mh17 noting flight mh17 a boeing 777 first flew on 71797 and crashed 17 years later on 71714 it has also been linked to a bizarre video of a speech imf president christine lagarde gave at the national press club in washington on january 15 2014 in which she repeatedly told the audience to pay attention to the magic number 7′′ and made numerological connections to wwi and other events",

            "text": "Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 exploded and crashed on a wheat field yesterday. The plane was carrying 298 people when it crashed in the eastern Ukraine. The facts state that the eastern Ukraine is controlled and captured by the Pro-Russian militants who want Ukraine to be a part of the Moscow’s radius. The plane was hit by a missile at a height of 33,000 feet; US officials have said that it was a anti-aircraft missile made in Russia. As Ukraine has shifted the responsibility to Russia stating that east part of the nation is not in their control.\n\nUS further described the missile stating the plane carrying passengers was hit by a SA series Russian made missile, as they studied the trajectory and the damage it did.\n\nIt is believed that people who struck the plane with missile might have been confused that it was a military plane but to the shock it was not. It was a disaster when everyone on the plane died and their corpses were scattered on the wheat fields.\n\nThe blame game had already begun when Russian President Vladimir Putin told that it was the fault of the Ukrainian government. East Ukraine has been an emergency zone and it is believed that the militants there have already shot at least three Ukrainian military planes yet. Nevertheless, Russian President did not deny that the missile was a Russian missile.\n\nThe crashing of the plane is the new international crisis; the passengers in the plane were more than of nine countries. The reality states that a day before the plane crash US had stuck new sanctions on Russia’s face for the terror in Ukraine.\n\nIf we look at the details then this is the same Malaysian Plane, with same model number that has suffered a blow the second time in a matter of few months.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak still has no answers for the tragedy. MH370 was a tragedy and he had no answers then too. This plane was carrying 283 passengers travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.\n\nIt is said that when the plane was almost 20 miles from the Russian borders, it disappeared from the radars at 2:15 PM. The route which it was travelling was a heavy traffic route and the plane gave no sign of being hit at first.\n\nNajib Razak said, “It is a tragic day in what has already been a tragic year for Malaysia. If it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice.\"\n\nMr. Razak also stated that he had a talk with the government of Netherlands and Ukraine who have further promised to cooperate. He also had a word with Barack Obama and said, “he and I both agreed that the investigation must not be hindered in any way.\"\n\nThe Presidents of Russian and the US had a talk about the tragedy too. The Russian President expressed condolence towards the incident and people who have been deceased. To the shock, the news agency of Russia quoted Putin saying, “This tragedy would not have happened if there was peace in the country, if military operations had not resumed in the southeast of Ukraine.”",

            "text": "Good Friday Morning !  Here are today’s Fast 5 Headlines !\n\n1.  The downed Malaysian airliner.  We now know there was one Canadian on board that downed Malaysian jetliner that killed all 298 aboard.  Ukraine released what it said was audio of phone calls between rebels and Russian officers. In one call, a rebel is heard saying, “We have just shot down a plane.”  In the conversation is the realization that a commercial airliner was shot down and how many people were on board. Most are saying its a surface to air missle that brought the airliner down.  ALSO: We have posted a picture showing Ukranian airspace a few hours after MH17 lost contact with radar.  www.businessinsider.com\n\n2.  Israel’s prime minister says he has ordered the military to prepare for a “significant expansion” of its ground operation against Gaza militants.  Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that the military has been instructed to deliver a blow to the Hamas tunnel network, which it could not do “only from the air.”  Israeli tanks and troops moved into Gaza late Thursday, following a 10-day campaign of more than 2,000 airstrikes that had failed to halt relentless Hamas rocket fire on Israeli cities.  Israel stepped up its campaign after the Islamic militant group refused to accept an Egyptian truce offer.\n\n3.  Will football viewers on CBS hear announcers refer to games between the Dallas Cowboys and the Washington “no-names?”  The network is leaving open the possibility, saying it won’t tell its announcers whether to use the nickname of the NFL’s Washington franchise during games it televises this coming season. CBS Sports chairman says the network doesn’t tell announcers what to say about any topic,  including team names. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says the league doesn’t dictate to broadcast partners how to cover the game. Redskins owner Dan Snyder has vowed not to change the name, despite growing pressure to do so because some Native Americans find it offensive.\n\n4.  A Kentucky man arrested for shoplifting allegedly tried to get back at the cops by pretending to be a police officer and ordering five Domino’s pizzas to the precinct.  Such a classic prank, and so hard to trace!  How did they ever suspect the culprit was Michael Harp, the man they had just arrested? For one thing, he was still at the station when the unwanted pizzas showed up. “While being booked at the police station, officers say Harp asked to make a phone call on his cell phone,” WKYT reports, “A little later, police say five pizzas from Domino’s were delivered to the station under the name of Officer Wilson, who is the same officer that arrested Harp.”  Police say they linked the call to Harp by tracking his cell phone number.  Despite the evidence, Harp still denies he was the pizza prankster.  www.gawker.com\n\n5.  Apollo 11!   45 years ago – the take off and then the landing of Apollo 11 on the moon.  Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins and Neil Armstrong!  The anniversary of the landing on July 20th 1969 is this Sunday.  Rich was 5 years old and says he remembers watching it !",

surfacetoair missile american officials have confirmed the plane was traveling at about 30000 feet according to tracking information from a military spy satellite the satellite was unable to detect where exactly the missile was fired military and intelligence analysts are using mathematical formulas highspeed computers and other sensors to try to pin down the missiles point of origin other analysts will work with the ukrainian authorities to recover and analyze pieces of the missile and the aircraft to help determine what kind of missile was fired the officials said the plane — malaysia airlines flight 17 en route from amsterdam to kuala lumpur malaysia — was carrying nearly 300 passengers and crew when it crashed and burned in an eastern ukraine wheat field near the russian border in an area roiled by fighting between prorussian separatists and ukrainian forces there were no known survivors ukrainian officials immediately called the crash an act of terrorism an armed prorussian separatist at the site of a malaysia airlines boeing 777 plane crash on thursday in the donetsk region of ukraine credit maxim zmeyevreuters the furiously unfolding investigation centered on ukrainian separatists or russian troops as the missile operators ukraine authorities said they have intercepted communications that prove separatist involvementbut the reason for the attack — whether it was a deliberate strike or a tragic accident — was unknown what we still dont know is what were they thinking one official said this is truly a grave situation said vice president joseph r biden jr of the united states speaking in detroit its important we get to the bottom of this sooner than later because of the possible repercussions that can flow beyond from this beyond the tragic loss of life ukraines president petro o poroshenko called for an immediate investigation and asked the dutch prime minister mark rutte to send dutch experts to assist i would like to note that we are calling this not an incident not a catastrophe but a terrorist act mr poroshenko said malaysias prime minister najib razak said if it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down we insist that the perpetrators must be brought to justice forensics evidence from the site as well as the satellite data and any intercepted communications would help analysts and investigators determine who fired the lethal missile defense department officials said late thursday that they were examining the possibility that ukrainian separatists with russian advisers had fired a captured ukrainian army buk missile system the separatists do not otherwise have the technology to shoot down an airliner at such a high altitude the officials said another possibility a senior pentagon official said was that russian troops just across the border from eastern ukraine may have fired the missile in both scenarios the senior official said the missile operator most likely mistook the malaysian airliner for a ukrainian military transport plane a third possibility the official said was that the russians supplied the rebels with the missile two senior pentagon officials said military analysts suspected that the missile was either an sa11 or an sa20 reporters arriving at the scene near the town of grabovo described dozens of lifeless bodies strewn about mostly intact in a field dotted with purple flowers with

black sweater lay on her back with blood streaming down her face and her left arm raised the carcass of the plane was still smoldering and rescue workers moved through the dark field with flashlights dogs barked in the distance and the air was filled with a bitter smell a regional airline official said the plane had been flying at about 33000 feet when radar lost track of it for months eastern

thursdays flight mh17 over ukraine but offered no further details immediately mr razak said initially in a twitter post that he was shocked by reports that an mh plane crashed we are launching an immediate investigation president obama who one day earlier had announced strengthened sanctions against russia over its support for the eastern ukraine separatists spoke by telephone with mr putin who raised the issue of the reports of the downed plane white house officials said josh earnest the white house press secretary said mr obama had been briefed about the plane crash later mr obama said the united states government was working to determine whether any americans had been aboard the flight russias interfax news agency said there had been no russians aboard there was no immediate word from the kremlin about the substance of the obamaputin telephone call the kremlin put out a short statement saying that mr putin had a previously scheduled telephone conversation with mr obama the parties had a detailed discussion about the crisis in ukraine the statement said mr putin repeated the need for an immediate ceasefire and objected to what he said was ukrainian army fire striking inside russia russian news agencies said mr putin also spoke by telephone to the president of malaysia and offered his condolences this is exactly why advanced weaponry must be tightly controlled neither russia or ukraine has the incentive to shoot down a commercial mr rutte the dutch prime minister said in a statement said he was deeply shocked by the crash a lot remains unclear about the reason circumstances and those on board he said i have just called with the ukrainian president the dutch state news agency quoted tour operator wtcnl as saying that around 20 to 30 dutch and belgian citizens had been on board andrei purgin deputy prime minister of the donetsk peoples republic the insurgent group in eastern ukraine denied in a telephone interview that the rebels had anything to do with the loss of the passenger jet he said that the rebels had shot down ukrainian planes before but that their antiaircraft weapons could reach only to around 4000 meters far below the cruising level of passenger jets we dont have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height he said he said that the plane had apparently come down in an area of ukrainian military operations and that it was not out of the question that the ukrainians themselves shot it down remember the black sea plane disaster he said referring to the 2001 crash of a siberian airlines passenger jet bound for novosibirsk from tel aviv that the ukrainians shot down by accident during a military training exercise anton geraschenko an adviser at ukraines interior ministry said on his facebook page that the malaysia airlines plane had been brought down by a russianmade buk or beech antiaircraft system russian missile systems are named for trees a reference book published by rosoboronexport the russian state weapons export monopoly describes the buk antiaircraft missile system as designed to target both low and highflying aircraft to a maximum height of 72000 feet mr geraschenko wrote that earlier thursday people in eastern ukraine supporting the central government had reported seeing a buk system moved from the town of torez toward the town of snezhnoye a commander of a rebel unit in donetsk said we could have shot down three planes over donetsk yesterday but we didnt because they could have been civilians he said the rebel forces did not have the buk system in comments broadcast on ukrainian television vitali klitschko the mayor of kiev and former heavyweight boxing champion said the crash illustrated the risks to peace in europe of the fighting in eastern ukraine this is not just a local conflict in donetsk and luhansk but a fullscale war in the center of europe he said im certain the international community this time will pay attention and understand solange knowles

the grisly scene of thursdays downing of a malaysia airlines jet the russian defense ministry sharply denied any involvement in the missile strike that ukrainian officials said ripped the boeing 777 from the sky and many began openly questioning why the airline had chosen to fly a civilian aircraft over a combat zone the crash site was still unsecured by midday friday raising questions about who controlled the flight data recorder cockpit voice recorder and other onboard devices that will help determine exactly how the crash occurred rebel spokesmen said they had recovered most of the devices but it was unclear when and to whom they would turn them over for investigation russian officials were adamant that they had nothing to do with the disaster continuing to point fingers at the ukrainian government and military in view of various types of speculation concerning operations of the russian armed forces in the areas bordering ukraine we affirm that the antiaircraft means of the russian armed forces did not operate in that region on july 17 the defense ministry said in a statement posted on its website after a malaysia airlines jet crashed in ukraine on thursday several amateur videos were posted online the statement also said that its air force was not flying within russia in the areas bordering donetsk on thursday officials in the united states confirmed late thursday that flight 17 with 298 people aboard had been shot down over grabovo ukraine by what they described as a russianmade antiaircraft missile fighting in eastern ukraine between the ukrainian military and prorussian separatists has been marked by the successful use of missiles against aircraft at higher and higher altitudes the downing on thursday of flight 17 struck at 33000 feet was the first at cruising altitude for modern commercial jets however the russian defense statement noted that units of the ukrainian army possessed the buk m1 air defense missile launchers that officials said was most likely responsible for bringing the jetliner down much of the speculation surrounding the crash has focused on that system particularly since the prorussian separatist forces in eastern ukraine bragged on social media in late june that they had taken possession of a buk system after capturing a ukrainian military base the crash remained the subject of intense debate in the small ukrainian town of grabovo as residents tried to come to grips with what had unfolded in the fields where they work just yards from their homes two villagers said quietly that they had seen the flash of a rocket in the sky around the time the plane went down victor who said he was too afraid to give his last name said that he had been in his garden at the time and that he had seen the light coming from a rocket he said it had come from the direction of snizhne a city where the ukrainians have been bombing rebel positions frequently for more than a week it was a rocket im sure of it he said the other villager sergei 15 who also did not want to give his last name said he had been swimming in a nearby river when he saw what appeared to be a rocket being launched into the sky he said he then jumped out of the water hopped on his motorbike and sped home continue reading the main story as a cloudy dawn came the full horror of the field was on display small white pieces of cloth dotted the grassy farmland marking the spots of bodies four rebels in fatigues were wandering through the ruins looking through peoples belongings and riffling through guidebooks and bags when asked who was responsible for the crash they looked incredulous and said that it had of course been the ukrainian military this wasnt ours said a rebel who identified himself only as alexei standing looking at an overhead bin in the grass with a rifle over his shoulder why would we do this were not animals the smell of flesh hung heavily near a broken hulk of metal on the road where a body lay splayed a foot with part of a leg was lying on the road the plane appeared to have broken apart at a great height as pieces were scattered across several miles of agricultural fields the two wings lay akimbo as if pushed forward on impact the plane was full of fuel when it crashed and the fire near the engine was fierce turning the twisted metal remains into molten pools that had hardened by morning this is direct provocation of the eu and the us said a rebel alexander nikolaevich who was walking along the road near the scene you see our weapons he said pointing to his aging gun we started to win the war and the fascists did this to stop us when asked if the fight would continue he said a little bit in malaysia the heavily muslim nation in southeast asia mourned on a holy ramadan friday shocked at the sudden loss of a second malaysia airlines boeing 777200 many began openly wondering why the plane was flying over a conflict in eastern ukraine where increasingly powerful surfacetoair missiles were being used in a statement delivered before dawn in kuala lumpur prime minister najib razak of malaysia pointedly noted that the international civil aviation organization had declared the airspace safe

aircrafts route during a news conference late on thursday afternoon at a kuala lumpur airport hotel liow tiong lai malaysias transport minister said repeatedly that the aircraft had been following a safe route that malaysia airlines had used for many years and that was still used by most asian airlines and by many european airlines including on the day of the crash during that period of time there are also many other aircraft using the same route he said european and ukrainian air traffic controllers had continued to route civil flights over the contested area even as the fighting worsened — and even as flights directed by russian air traffic controllers had apparently started to avoid it ukrainian intelligence has pointed to a fighter named igor bezler the militia leader in the eastern town of gorlovka saying in an intercepted phone call that his men had shot down a plane on thursday several assassinations are believed to have happened under mr bezlers watch soon after his forces took gorlovka and he took responsibility for killing a number of ukrainian militiamen in the town of volnovakha some weeks ago according to russian internet sources he was born in 1965 in crimea and studied in russia he served in the russian military but moved back to ukraine in 2003 where he began to work as the head of security for a factory in gorlovka biographies also note that he had worked in a company that performed burial services but was fired in 2012 he has been wanted by the ukrainian authorities since april 2014 mr bezlers nom de guerre is bes which in russian sounds like the first syllable of his last name but also means demon there are rumors that mr bezler does not get along with other militia leaders and that he has had street battles with the vostok battalion though rebels have dismissed those allegations in a slickly produced video called heroes of novorossii the name of the selfdeclared insurgent region mr bezler was shown wearing a light blue beret he had blue eyes and a long mustache in a recent interview with the russian news agency ria novosti he claimed to be holding 14 ukrainian soldiers hostage and said that the ukrainian military had fallen apart much like the condition of the russian military in the early 1990s in the interview mr bezler said he was a russian passport holder but had a residency permit in ukraine he said he sang the national anthem of the soviet union every morning and usually went to bed around 1030 pm he confirmed that he had worked as head of security for the gorlovka factory and claimed that he was fired from the burial services company over a fight with the local mayor who he said was demanding bribes peter marosszeky a longtime aircraft engineer and former senior executive at qantas panam and american airlines who advised boeing on the development of the 777 aircraft said in a telephone interview that the 777200 had an extremely long range and would have enough fuel to divert around a dangerous area during a 12hour flight if the pilots chose to do so but he said that airlines have typically not worried until now about surfacetoair missiles reaching planes at cruising altitude because only a very large missile with a lot of fuel could ascend such a distance mr marosszeky expressed skepticism that militiamen could readily fire such a large missile without training as well as cooperation from whoever owned or manufactured the missile youve got to have special codes and so forth to operate these things he said while international experts put the blame on whoever fired the missile questions about why commercial air traffic was continuing in the area — and about when air traffic should be stopped over similar areas of fighting in the future — could prove difficult to answer the investigation into the loss of flight 17 is laden with potential disputes over sovereignty mark a dombroff a partner focusing on the aviation industry at mckenna long aldridge a national law firm in the united states said that legal precedents indicated that if a plane is downed by military action the lead country in the investigation is the one over whose territory the plane was shot down that appears to be ukraine in this case — but the rebels in eastern ukraine where the plane crashed do not recognize the leadership in kiev and may try to claim the lead role in the investigation continue reading the main story continue reading the main story one of the most complicated factors is getting investigators on the ground in hostile territory mr dombroff said ukraine or the rebels — or both — could decide to transfer leadership of the crash investigation either to the country of registry of the aircraft which would be malaysia or to the country of manufacture for the aircraft which would be the united states where the boeing 777 was made alexander borodai the prime minister of the selfdeclared donetsk peoples republic the main separatist organization said the group was setting up a committee to investigate the crash the news agency interfax reported russian government officials continued to emphasize the official line friday that the investigation was under ukrainian jurisdiction leading a crash investigation is in some ways a formality for developing countries as most of the worlds investigators with crash experience tend to come from countries that manufacture aircraft and certify their airworthiness russias proximity to the crash site close ties to the rebels and extensive aviation experience means that it could try to play a sizable advisory role particularly if the rebels follow through on reported plans to locate the flight data recorders and send them to moscow the crash is another setback for malaysia airlines which has already been struggling to recover from the loss of flight 370 which vanished on march 8 during a redeye flight from kuala lumpur to beijing the enduring mystery over flight 370 has already severely hurt demand for malaysia airlines tickets forcing the airline to offer budget carrier prices even though it bears the costs of a fullservice airline the financial penalty on malaysia airlines was clear on friday morning when two planes one from cathay pacific and one from malaysia airlines left hong kong international airport five minutes apart both bound for kuala lumpur the cathay pacific was sold out in every class of service and was so overbooked that the airline took the unusual step of calling at least one passenger at home the night before the flight and telling him that he had been involuntarily bounced to the flight operated by malaysia airlines for which cathay pacific has a shared marketing code by contrast the malaysia airlines flight was at least onethird empty the bulk of the passengers appeared to have come from two separate companies that were holding meetings in kuala lumpur and had bought blocks of tickets for their employees to get there at discounted prices both korean air lines and asiana airlines have confirmed that they have not flown planes through ukrainian airspace since march 3 we detoured our flight because of political instability there said lee hyomin a spokeswoman at asiana which had been flying a cargo plane through ukrainian airspace once a week from brussels to incheon south korea until that point korean air lines had been sending 42 passenger and cargo flights per month through ukrainian airspace but those flights had been rerouted beginning on march 3 company officials said civilian jetliners have been shot down on a few previous occasions including by the united states the uss vincennes used a pair of surfacetoair missiles in 1988 to destroy iran air flight 655 killing 290 people when the ships radar operators mistakenly concluded that the plane was descending toward them in a possible attack a later review found that the jetliner was ascending at the time it had been following a flight path that iranian f14 fighter jets had used in the preceding days to approach the american vessel before veering away when warned by radio in 1983 a russian air force fighter jet downed a korean air lines flight that was traveling from new york city to seoul by way of anchorage after the plane wandered off course chinese fighters shot down a cathay pacific airliner in 1954 off the coast of hainan island southern china in an

            "text": "By SABRINA TAVERNISE and KEITH BRADSHER\n\n New York Times\n\n JULY 18, 2014\n\nGRABOVO, Ukraine — As rescue teams slowly converged on the grisly scene of Thursday’s downing of a Malaysia Airlines jet, the Russian defense ministry sharply denied any involvement in the missile strike that Ukrainian officials said ripped the Boeing 777 from the sky and many began openly questioning why the airline had chosen to fly a civilian aircraft over a combat zone.\n\nThe crash site was still unsecured by midday Friday, raising questions about who controlled the flight data recorder, cockpit voice recorder and other onboard devices that will help determine exactly how the crash occurred. Rebel spokesmen said they had recovered most of the devices, but it was unclear when and to whom they would turn them over for investigation.\n\nRussian officials were adamant that they had nothing to do with the disaster, continuing to point fingers at the Ukrainian government and military. “In view of various types of speculation concerning operations of the Russian armed forces in the areas bordering Ukraine, we affirm that the anti-aircraft means of the Russian armed forces did not operate in that region on July 17,” the defense ministry said in a statement posted on its website.\n\nAfter a Malaysia Airlines jet crashed in Ukraine on Thursday, several amateur videos were posted online.\n\nThe statement also said that its air force was not flying within Russia in the areas bordering Donetsk on Thursday.\n\nOfficials in the United States confirmed late Thursday that Flight 17, with 298 people aboard, had been shot down over Grabovo, Ukraine, by what they described as a Russian-made antiaircraft missile. Fighting in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian separatists has been marked by the successful use of missiles against aircraft at higher and higher altitudes. The downing on Thursday of Flight 17, struck at 33,000 feet, was the first at cruising altitude for modern commercial jets, however.\n\nThe Russian defense statement noted that units of the Ukrainian Army possessed the BUK M1 air defense missile launchers that officials said was most likely responsible for bringing the jetliner down. Much of the speculation surrounding the crash has focused on that system, particularly since the pro-Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine bragged on social media in late June that they had taken possession of a BUK system after capturing a Ukrainian military base.\n\nThe crash remained the subject of intense debate in the small Ukrainian town of Grabovo, as residents tried to come to grips with what had unfolded in the fields where they work, just yards from their homes.\n\nTwo villagers said quietly that they had seen the flash of a rocket in the sky around the time the plane went down. Victor, who said he was too afraid to give his last name, said that he had been in his garden at the time and that he had seen “the light coming from a rocket.”\n\nHe said it had come from the direction of Snizhne, a city where the Ukrainians have been bombing rebel positions frequently for more than a week. “It was a rocket, I’m sure of it,” he said.\n\nThe other villager, Sergei, 15, who also did not want to give his last name, said he had been swimming in a nearby river when he saw what appeared to be a rocket being launched into the sky. He said he then jumped out of the water, hopped on his motorbike and sped home.\n\n Continue reading the main story\n\nAs a cloudy dawn came, the full horror of the field was on display. Small white pieces of cloth dotted the grassy farmland, marking the spots of bodies.\n\nFour rebels in fatigues were wandering through the ruins, looking through people’s belongings and riffling through guidebooks and bags.\n\nWhen asked who was responsible for the crash, they looked incredulous and said that it had of course been the Ukrainian military.\n\n“This wasn’t ours,” said a rebel who identified himself only as Alexei, standing looking at an overhead bin in the grass with a rifle over his shoulder. “Why would we do this? We’re not animals.”\n\nThe smell of flesh hung heavily near a broken hulk of metal on the road where a body lay splayed. A foot with part of a leg was lying on the road.\n\nThe plane appeared to have broken apart at a great height as pieces were scattered across several miles of agricultural fields. The two wings lay akimbo, as if pushed forward on impact. The plane was full of fuel when it crashed and the fire near the engine was fierce, turning the twisted metal remains into molten pools that had hardened by morning.\n\n“This is direct provocation of the E.U. and the U.S.,” said a rebel, Alexander Nikolaevich, who was walking along the road near the scene. “You see our weapons,” he said pointing to his aging gun. “We started to win the war and the fascists did this to stop us.”\n\nWhen asked if the fight would continue, he said, “a little bit.”\n\nIn Malaysia, the heavily Muslim nation in Southeast Asia mourned on a holy Ramadan Friday, shocked at the sudden loss of a second Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200. Many began openly wondering why the plane was flying over a conflict in eastern Ukraine where increasingly powerful surface-to-air missiles were being used.\n\nIn a statement delivered before dawn in Kuala Lumpur , Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia pointedly noted that the International Civil Aviation Organization had declared the airspace safe and that the International Air Transport Association had not restricted travel there. “We must — and we will — find out precisely what happened to this flight,” he said.\n\nPeppered with questions about the aircraft’s route during a news conference late on Thursday afternoon at a Kuala Lumpur airport hotel, Liow Tiong Lai, Malaysia’s transport minister, said repeatedly that the aircraft had been following a safe route that Malaysia Airlines had used for many years and that was still used by most Asian airlines and by many European airlines, including on the day of the crash. “During that period of time, there are also many other aircraft using the same route,” he said.\n\nEuropean and Ukrainian air traffic controllers had continued to route civil flights over the contested area even as the fighting worsened — and even as flights directed by Russian air traffic controllers had apparently started to avoid it.\n\nUkrainian intelligence has pointed to a fighter named Igor Bezler, the militia leader in the eastern town of Gorlovka, saying in an intercepted phone call that his men had “shot down a plane” on Thursday. Several assassinations are believed to have happened under Mr. Bezler’s watch soon after his forces took Gorlovka, and he took responsibility for killing a number of Ukrainian militiamen in the town of Volnovakha some weeks ago.\n\nAccording to Russian Internet sources, he was born in 1965 in Crimea, and studied in Russia. He served in the Russian military but moved back to Ukraine in 2003, where he began to work as the head of security for a factory in Gorlovka. Biographies also note that he had worked in a company that performed burial services but was fired in 2012. He has been wanted by the Ukrainian authorities since April 2014.\n\nMr. Bezler’s nom de guerre is Bes, which in Russian sounds like the first syllable of his last name, but also means demon. There are rumors that Mr. Bezler does not get along with other militia leaders, and that he has had street battles with the Vostok Battalion, though rebels have dismissed those allegations.\n\nIn a slickly produced video called “Heroes of Novorossii,” the name of the self-declared insurgent region, Mr. Bezler was shown wearing a light blue beret. He had blue eyes and a long mustache. In a recent interview with the Russian news agency RIA Novosti, he claimed to be holding 14 Ukrainian soldiers hostage and said that the Ukrainian military had fallen apart, “much like the condition of the Russian military in the early 1990s.”\n\nIn the interview, Mr. Bezler said he was a Russian passport holder but had a residency permit in Ukraine. He said he sang the national anthem of the Soviet Union every morning, and usually went to bed around 10:30 p.m. He confirmed that he had worked as head of security for the Gorlovka factory, and claimed that he was fired from the burial services company over a fight with the local mayor who he said was demanding bribes.\n\nPeter Marosszeky, a longtime aircraft engineer and former senior executive at Qantas, PanAm and American Airlines who advised Boeing on the development of the 777 aircraft, said in a telephone interview that the 777-200 had an extremely long range and would have enough fuel to divert around a dangerous area during a 12-hour flight if the pilots chose to do so.

The investigation into the loss of Flight 17 is laden with potential disputes over sovereignty.\n\nMark A. Dombroff, a partner focusing on the aviation industry at McKenna Long & Aldridge, a national law firm in the United States, said that legal precedents indicated that if a plane is downed by military action, the lead country in the investigation is the one over whose territory the plane was shot down. That appears to be Ukraine in this case — but the rebels in eastern Ukraine, where the plane crashed, do not recognize the leadership in Kiev and may try to claim the lead role in the investigation.\n\n Continue reading the main story Continue reading the main story\n\n“One of the most complicated factors is getting investigators on the ground in hostile territory,” Mr. Dombroff said.\n\nUkraine or the rebels — or both — could decide to transfer leadership of the crash investigation either to the country of registry of the aircraft, which would be Malaysia, or to the country of manufacture for the aircraft, which would be the United States, where the Boeing 777 was made.\n\nAlexander Borodai, the prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, the main separatist organization, said the group was setting up a committee to investigate the crash, the news agency Interfax reported.

China’s explanation at the time was that it had feared the Cathay Pacific plane might actually be a military aircraft belonging to the nationalists on Taiwan, who had lost the civil war in mainland China but remained technically at war.\n\nKeith Bradsher reported from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Sabrina Tavernise reported from Grabovo, Ukraine.

The press conferences by malaysian airlines are just as pathetic for this crash, as they were 3 months ago when their last plane was lost! Posted 11:00 pm, 07/19/2014 alonzo, I noticed that, too. Can't help but wonder why on earth the pilots would fly into a danger zone. If they had stayed on course they wouldn't have been in the disputed area. Posted 10:56 pm, 07/19/2014 Some people was saying that there was dead bodies falling and crashing in their houses and laying in gardens. Posted 10:14 pm, 07/19/2014 Not to excuse the shooting down of a passenger plane, but the Obama=backed Kiev regime in Ukraine has been indiscriminately bombing cities in eastern Ukraine for weeks; killing hundreds if not thousands of innocent civilians.\n\n\n\nNary a protest raised? Posted 6:32 am, 07/19/2014 Airlines including Qantas Airways and Air Berlin altered their flight paths months ago to avoid Ukrainian air space after fighting flared up in the region, raising questions about why others did not do the same. The issue of whether to avoid flying over conflict zones has come into sharp focus since the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 on Thursday with 298 people in board. Posted 6:24 am, 07/19/2014 Why single out this plane when the route is heavily traveled by other air traffic? There's more to this than meets the eye. Posted 6:17 am, 07/19/2014 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/...6975/Putin\n\n\n\nIs this proof that MH17 change course into a war zone? A route map compiled by Twitter user Vagelis Karmiros using data from flight-tracking website Flightaware claims to show how the doomed Malaysia Airlines plane took a different flightpath to the ones taken by the previous ten MH17 flights Posted 12:39 am, 07/19/2014 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/...6975/Putin Posted 11:29 pm, 07/18/2014 There is a skunk in the wood pile somewhere with the Malaysian airliner that just 'disappeared' and this one that flew into a known restricted air space and was blown up. Definitely a skunk in the woodpile as we will someday find out. Posted 11:20 pm, 07/18/2014 I see Umpire is using his favorite slang words and working hard to prove everyone wrong, looking for a bar fight as usual. Posted 11:05 pm, 07/18/2014 NOW STUPIDARSE, HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT? Posted 11:03 pm, 07/18/2014 This was an active war zone that commercial aircraft have been avoiding for months. Why was this plane instructed by flight controllers into a restricted zone?\n\n\n\nSomeone benefits from escalating chaos. Barry? Posted 12:27 am, 07/18/2014 Actually try at least 1961. You forgot Bay of Pigs Posted 10:59 pm, 07/17/2014 It was definitely a Russian missile, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. The US has been selling weapons to terrorists since at least 1985 (Arms for Hostages), so God knows what the terrorists have -\n\n\n\n Ukraine accused the separatists of carrying out what it called a terrorist attack. American intelligence and military officials said the plane had been destroyed by a Russian SA-series missile, based on surveillance satellite data that showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not its point of origin. There were strong indications that those responsible may have errantly downed what they had thought was a military aircraft only to discover, to their shock, that they had struck a civilian airliner.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2014....html?_r=0 Posted 10:48 pm, 07/17/2014 Okay say it was a small terrorist group, well somebody provided them with access to a weapon that could cause such destruction. Posted 10:37 pm, 07/17/2014 monsterhunter (view profile) I could care less. Keep your butt in USA and take care of our own problems.\n\n\n\n \n\n Posted 10:33 pm, 07/17/2014 Let them and Russia battle it out. Posted 10:32 pm, 07/17/2014 US has enough problems stay out of it and stay home take care of the problems here u will have more than a hand full. Posted 10:32 pm, 07/17/2014 I can understand helping to find who did it, because if it's a terrorist group then our planes could be next.

b777200er registration 9mmrd manufactured in july 1997 and with a total of 75322 hours in a sad coincidence the first flight of the aircraft was 17 july 1997 there were 283 passengers including three infants and fifteen malaysian crew members mh17 departed normally from amsterdam at 1014 utc just past noon local time and was due to arrive at kuala lumpur international airport at 2200 utc the expected flight time was 11 hours 45 minutes the planned route for the flight took the aircraft directly over the ukraine and russia the flight plan requested a cruising altitude of 35000 feet but when mh17 entered ukrainian airspace they were given an altitude of 33000 feet at 1415 utc four hours into the flight ukrainian air traffic control lost contact with the flight at the moment of lost contact the boeing 777 was 30 km 20 miles from the tamak waypoint which is about 50 km 30 miles from the russianukraine border there was no distress call the aircraft wreckage was scattered over a two kilometre area at the village of hrabove near the russian border the state of the wreckage made it clear that it had broken up before impact with the ground the news was quickly released the commercial aircraft full of civilians had been shot down two key questions arose very quickly why was an aircraft flying over a war zone and who shot it down the conflict between russia and ukraine has become focused on the question of the ukraine entering trade agreements with the eu rather than maintaining closer ties with russia in november 2013 the thenpresident of the ukraine rejected a much anticipated eu economic proposal which was criticised as setting up ukraine for longterm economic disaster by taking away the russian export market whilst tying it to markets from which it can only import instead the thenpresident accepted a new deal from russia offering 15 billion in aid and other economic benefits the conflict reached a crisis point in february when ukraine ousted their prorussian president and the new government refocused on a closer relationship with the european union russia argued that a relatively small group of antirussian extremists in ukraine had staged the coup and that they were a threat to the russianspeaking people who live in eastern ukraine and crimea in march the russians took control of crimea however ukrainian government continues to claim crimea as a part of ukraine as a result airline operators and aircraft were recommended to avoid the area over crimea the black sea and the sea of asov this was however not because of fears that civilian aircraft would be shot down but because there were two different services russian and ukrainian both managing the airspace at the same time europe safety agency urges airlines to avoid crimean airspace reuters it is unsafe if more than one air traffic service provider is in charge of one single flight information region fir no compromise can be made with the safety of the flying passengers patrick ky executive director at easa said eurocontrol the european air traffic management agency said it strongly advised carriers against flying through the region known as simferopol fir and published a map of alternative routes the us and the uk both released a notice to airmen notam advising that this area be avoided but the area specified was south of the crash site in the aftermath many airlines announced that they had previously taken the decision to reroute to avoid flying over the conflict zone flightradar24 however have pointed out that their logs show that some of these airlines were in fact still routing over ukraine in the days previous many airlines certainly continued to route over the 32000 foot nofly zone the most frequent flyers over donetsk last week were aeroflot 86 flights singapore airlines 75 ukraine international airlines 62 lufthansa 56 and malaysia airlines 48 on the 14th of july a new notam was issued which covered the dnipropetrovsk region this notam did include the airspace over eastern ukraine but only up to fl320 that is to say the airspace up to a flight level of 32000 feet this was apparently in response to a ukrainian cargo plane which was shot down at 21000 feet the airspace over 33000 feet was not controlled and was not closed malaysia airlines have come under fire for routing over a war zone but have countered that the flight plan was approved by eurcontrol who are responsible for determining civil aircraft flight paths over european airspace in april the international civil aviation organization identified an area over the crimean peninsula as risky at no point did mh17 fly into or request to fly into this area at all times mh17 was in airspace approved by the icao eurocontrols response is quite clear according to our information the aircraft was flying at flight level 330 approximately 10000 metres33000 feet when it disappeared from the radar this route had been closed by the ukrainian authorities from ground to flight level 320 but was open at the level at which the aircraft was flying since the crash the ukrainian authorities have informed eurocontrol of the closure of routes from the ground to unlimited in eastern ukraine dnipropetrovsk flight information region all flight plans that are filed using these routes are now being rejected by eurocontrol the routes will remain closed until further notice on that day a number of commercial aircraft flew over the area including aeroflot air india lufthansa singapore airlines and virgin atlantic and of course malaysian airlines mh17 the new york times reported that the missile was detected by military satellite jetliner explodes over ukraine struck by missile officials say – nytimescom grabovo ukraine — a malaysia airlines boeing 777 with 298 people aboard exploded crashed and burned on a flowered wheat field thursday in a part of eastern ukraine controlled by prorussia separatists blown out of the sky at 33000 feet by what ukrainian and american officials described as a russianmade antiaircraft missile ukraine accused the separatists of carrying out what it called a terrorist attack american intelligence and military officials said the plane had been destroyed by a russian saseries missile based on surveillance satellite data that showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not its point of origin the ukraines interior ministry specifically stated that mh17 was hit by a surfacetoair missile sam specifically the sa11 buk missile system the sovietdesigned buk missile launcher has a maximum range of 13 nautical miles and can fire up to a ceiling of 39400 feet so the malaysian boeing 777 was easily in range of it — and still would have been if theyd been given their requested altitude of 35000 feet it has a radar guidance system and a 70 kilogram warhead both russian and ukrainian forces have these highend missile systems at this stage it seems very likely that the aircraft was shot down by a power sam but no one has taken responsibility for the shot ukrainian president petro poroshenko claim that the separatists carried out the attack with russian support russian president vladimir putin did not make any statement on who shot the missile focusing instead on the political aspect the state over whose territory this occurred bears responsibility for this awful tragedy up until now the prorussia separatists in the ukraine were known to have portable surfacetoair missiles but there was not any hard information that they had access to highend missile systems with that high of a range however on twitter there was apparently a photograph posted by separatists now deleted showed a photograph of a buk missile system in addition associated press journalists stated that they saw what looked like a buk missile launcher in snizhne an eastern town which is held by the separatists it is possible that they captured a ukrainian buk missile launcher or that they were supplied the technology by the russians along with the training of how to use it there was also the question of a post on a social networking service by a military commander of the rebels in which he ported that the rebels had shot down an aircraft at approximately the same time as mh17 disappeared in the same area the post was deleted shortly after the news of the mh17 crash was released however it is still visible on the wayback machine an internet archive and can be translated using online services such as google translate wall vk the poster appears to have believed that the aircraft was a ukrainian military cargo plane and stated we did warn you – do not fly in our sky meanwhile the ukrainian authorities released recordings of phone conversations which they claim are between the separatists and russian military officedrs the bbc has published the recordings of the three phone calls with translations bbc news – mh17 crash ukraine releases alleged intercepts malaysia airlines appear to have

            "text": "Malaysia Airlines flight 17 was a passenger jet en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. The aircraft was a B777-200ER, registration 9M-MRD, manufactured in July 1997 and with a total of 75,322 hours. In a sad coincidence, the first flight of the aircraft was 17 July 1997.\n\nThere were 283 passengers (including three infants) and fifteen Malaysian crew members.\n\nMH17 departed normally from Amsterdam at 10:14 UTC (just past noon local time) and was due to arrive at Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 22:00 UTC. The expected flight time was 11 hours 45 minutes.\n\nThe planned route for the flight took the aircraft directly over the Ukraine and Russia. The flight plan requested a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet but when MH17 entered Ukrainian airspace, they were given an altitude of 33,000 feet.\n\nAt 14:15 UTC, four hours into the flight, Ukrainian Air Traffic Control lost contact with the flight. At the moment of lost contact, the Boeing 777 was 30 km (20 miles) from the TAMAK waypoint, which is about 50 km (30 miles) from the Russian-Ukraine border. There was no distress call.\n\nThe aircraft wreckage was scattered over a two kilometre area at the village of Hrabove near the Russian border. The state of the wreckage made it clear that it had broken up before impact with the ground. The news was quickly released: the commercial aircraft full of civilians had been shot down.\n\nTwo key questions arose very quickly: Why was an aircraft flying over a war zone and who shot it down?\n\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine has become focused on the question of the Ukraine entering trade agreements with the EU rather than maintaining closer ties with Russia. In November 2013 the then-president of the Ukraine rejected a much anticipated EU economic proposal which was criticised as setting up Ukraine for long-term economic disaster by taking away the Russian export market whilst tying it to markets from which it can only import. Instead, the then-president accepted a new deal from Russia offering $15 billion in aid and other economic benefits. The conflict reached a crisis point in February when Ukraine ousted their pro-Russian president and the new government refocused on a closer relationship with the European Union. Russia argued that a relatively small group of anti-Russian extremists in Ukraine had staged the coup and that they were a threat to the Russian-speaking people who live in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea.\n\nIn March, the Russians took control of Crimea. However, Ukrainian government continues to claim Crimea as a part of Ukraine. As a result, airline operators and aircraft were recommended to avoid the area over Crimea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Asov. This was, however, not because of fears that civilian aircraft would be shot down but because there were two different services (Russian and Ukrainian) both managing the airspace at the same time.\n\nEurope safety agency urges airlines to avoid Crimean airspace | Reuters\n\nThe US and the UK both released a Notice To AirMen (NOTAM) advising that this area be avoided, but the area specified was south of the crash site.\n\nIn the aftermath, many airlines announced that they had previously taken the decision to reroute to avoid flying over the conflict zone. FlightRadar24, however, have pointed out that their logs show that some of these airlines were in fact still routing over Ukraine in the days previous. Many airlines certainly continued to route over the 32,000 foot no-fly zone. The most frequent flyers over Donetsk last week were Aeroflot (86 flights), Singapore Airlines (75), Ukraine International Airlines (62), Lufthansa (56) and Malaysia Airlines (48).\n\nOn the 14th of July, a new NOTAM was issued which covered the Dnipropetrovsk region. This NOTAM did include the airspace over Eastern Ukraine but only up to FL320, that is to say, the airspace up to a flight level of 32,000 feet. This was apparently in response to a Ukrainian cargo plane which was shot down at 21,000 feet.\n\nThe airspace over 33,000 feet was not controlled and was not closed. Malaysia Airlines have come under fire for routing over a war zone but have countered that the flight plan was approved by Eurcontrol, who are responsible for determining civil aircraft flight paths over European airspace.\n\nEurocontrol’s response is quite clear:\n\nOn that day, a number of commercial aircraft flew over the area, including Aeroflot, Air India, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic and of course, Malaysian Airlines MH17.\n\n The New York Times reported that the missile was detected by military satellite.\n\nJetliner Explodes Over Ukraine; Struck by Missile, Officials Say – NYTimes.com\n\nThe Ukraine’s Interior Ministry specifically stated that MH17 was hit by a Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM), specifically the SA-11 Buk missile system. The Soviet-designed Buk missile launcher has a maximum range of 13 nautical miles and can fire up to a ceiling of 39,400 feet, so the Malaysian Boeing 777 was easily in range of it — and still would have been if they’d been given their requested altitude of 35,000 feet. It has a radar guidance system and a 70 kilogram warhead. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces have these high-end missile systems.\n\nAt this stage, it seems very likely that the aircraft was shot down by a power SAM but no one has taken responsibility for the shot. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko claim that the separatists carried out the attack with Russian support. Russian President Vladimir Putin did not make any statement on who shot the missile, focusing instead on the political aspect. “The state over whose territory this occurred bears responsibility for this awful tragedy.”\n\nUp until now, the pro-Russia separatists in the Ukraine were known to have portable surface-to-air missiles but there was not any hard information that they had access to high-end missile systems with that high of a range. However, on Twitter there was apparently a photograph posted by separatists, now deleted, showed a photograph of a Buk missile system. In addition, Associated Press journalists stated that they saw what looked like a Buk missile launcher in Snizhne, an eastern town which is held by the separatists. It is possible that they captured a Ukrainian Buk missile launcher or that they were supplied the technology by the Russians along with the training of how to use it.\n\nThere was also the question of a post on a social networking service by a military commander of the rebels, in which he ported that the rebels had shot down an aircraft at approximately the same time as MH17 disappeared, in the same area. The post was deleted shortly after the news of the MH17 crash was released, however it is still visible on the Wayback Machine (an Internet archive) and can be translated using online services such as Google Translate: Wall | VK.

Poroshenko, said in a statement that he was calling for an immediate investigation of the crash of the plane, which was en route to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from Amsterdam. There were no reported survivors among the 280 passengers and 15 crew members.Reporters arriving at the scene near the town of Grabovo described dozens of lifeless bodies, mostly intact, in a wheat field with purple flowers, with pieces of the plane scattered across a road lined with fire engines and emergency vehicles. One passenger in a black sweater lay on her back, with blood streaming down her face and her left arm raised.A regional airline official said the plane had been flying at about 33,000 feet when radar lost track of it.PhotoAn armed pro-Russian separatist at the site of a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 plane crash on Thursday in the Donetsk region of Ukraine.

head of women for afghan women showed photos of a girl who reported being raped by a mullah credit bryan denton for the new york times kunduz afghanistan — it was bad enough that the alleged rape took place in the sanctity of a mosque and that the accused man was a mullah who invoked the familiar defense that it had been consensual sex but the victim was only 10 years old and there was more the authorities said her family members openly planned to carry out an honor killing in the case — against the young girl the mullah offered to marry his victim instead this past week the awful matter became even worse on tuesday local policemen removed the girl from the shelter that had given her refuge and returned her to her family despite complaints from womens activists that she was likely to be killed continue reading the main story related coverage the case has broader repercussions the head of the women for afghan women shelter here where the girl took refuge dr hassina sarwari was at one point driven into hiding by death threats from the girls family and other mullahs who sought to play down the crime by arguing the girl was much older than 10 one militia commander sent dr sarwari threatening texts and an ultimatum to return the girl to her family the doctor said she now wanted to flee afghanistan continue reading the main story the head of the womens affairs office in kunduz nederah geyah who actively campaigned to have the young girl protected from her family and the mullah prosecuted resigned on may 21 and moved to another part of the country the case itself would just be an aberrant atrocity except that the resulting support for the mullah and for the girls family and its honor killing plans have become emblematic of a broader failure to help afghan women who have been victims of violence the result challenges hopes that western aid and encouragement can make lasting headway on behalf of afghan women particularly in remote parts of the country where traditional customs are still stronger than modern law here taliban insurgents and progovernment elements often make common cause in their hatred of progress in womens rights most of which has come about with international funding and pressure most of the anger in kunduz has been focused not on the mullah but on the womens activists and the shelter which is one of seven operated across afghanistan by w omen for afghan women an afghanrun charity that is heavily dependent on american aid from both government and private donors people know this office as the americans office dr sarwari said they all think the shelter is an american shelter there isnt a single american here she said waw is not americanrun said manizha naderi its executive director every single staff member is an afghan they are from the communities we work in our only concern is to make sure women and girls are protected and that they get justice as the western withdrawal from afghanistan has accelerated rights advocates are seeing a sharp difference in their funding we already see the signs of losing the support of the international community said ms geyah in an interview before she resigned no ones funding new civil society programs anymore none of the foreigners show up anymore theyre all in hiding and i think what gains we have achieved the last 13 years were slowly losing all of them the accused mullah mohammad amin was arrested and confessed to having sex with the girl after quran recitation classes at the mosque on may 1 but claimed that he thought the girl was older and that she responded to his advances the girls own testimony and medical evidence supported a rape so violent that it caused a fistula or a break in the wall between the vagina and rectum according to the police and the official bill of indictment she bled so profusely after the attack that she was at one point in danger of losing her life because of a delay in getting medical care after the two womens officials began speaking out about the case they started receiving threatening calls from mullahs — some of them taliban others on the government side — and from arbakai or progovernment militiamen one of their claims was that the girl was actually 17 and thus of marriageable age not 10 photographs of the girl that dr sarwari took in the hospital clearly show a prepubescent child and the doctor said the girl weighed only 40 pounds few afghans have birth records and many do not know their precise ages but the girls mother said she was 10 and a forensic examination in the hospital agreed saying she had not yet started menstruating or developing secondary sexual characteristics photo children at a women for afghan women home some of the groups activists have faced threats credit bryan denton for the new york times in the photographs which dr sarwari displayed on her laptop computer recently the girl has beautiful alabaster features and inky black hair cut in a pageboy style she lay in her hospital bed under a quilted blanket with cartoon characters on it ms geyah said she showed photos of the girl to government officials and prosecutors to prove that she was much too young to have consented dr sarwari said we wanted to give her a face to make her real to them ms geyah said i went to the hospital when they brought her there i was sitting next to her bed when i overheard her mother and aunt saying that her father was under tremendous pressure by the villagers to kill the girl because she had brought shame to them such honor killings in rape cases are common in afghanistan and are often more important to the victims family than vengeance against the attacker human rights groups say about 150 honor killings a year come to light and many more probably go unreported when dr sarwari who is a pediatrician arrived to pick up the girl at the hospital a crowd of village elders from alti gumbad the girls home village on the outskirts of the city of kunduz were gathered outside the hospital the girls brothers father and uncle were among them inside dr sarwari encountered the girls aunt who told her she had been ordered by her husband to sneak the girl out of the hospital and deliver her to the male relatives outside she said they wanted to take her and kill her and dump her in the river dr sarwari said efforts to reach the girls relatives by telephone were unsuccessful and insurgent activity around alti gumbad made the village too dangerous for journalists to visit the girls family gave us a guarantee that they would not harm her said sayed sarwar hussaini head of the kunduz police criminal investigation division we would not hand her back unless we were sure in the hospital room the doctor found the girls mother holding her childs hand and both were weeping my daughter may dust and soil protect you now dr sarwari quoted the mother as saying we will make you a bed of dust and soil we will send you to the cemetery where you will be safe even mothers here often believe that there is no choice but to kill rape victims who are seen as unmarriageable and therefore a lifelong burden to their families as well as a constant reminder of dishonor their men

            "text": "KUNDUZ, Afghanistan — It was bad enough that the alleged rape took place in the sanctity of a mosque, and that the accused man was a mullah who invoked the familiar defense that it had been consensual sex.\n\nBut the victim was only 10 years old. And there was more: The authorities said her family members openly planned to carry out an “honor killing” in the case — against the young girl. The mullah offered to marry his victim instead.\n\nThis past week, the awful matter became even worse. On Tuesday, local policemen removed the girl from the shelter that had given her refuge and returned her to her family, despite complaints from women’s activists that she was likely to be killed.\n\nThe case has broader repercussions. The head of the Women for Afghan Women shelter here where the girl took refuge, Dr. Hassina Sarwari, was at one point driven into hiding by death threats from the girl’s family and other mullahs, who sought to play down the crime by arguing the girl was much older than 10. One militia commander sent Dr. Sarwari threatening texts and an ultimatum to return the girl to her family. The doctor said she now wanted to flee Afghanistan.\n\nThe head of the women’s affairs office in Kunduz, Nederah Geyah, who actively campaigned to have the young girl protected from her family and the mullah prosecuted, resigned on May 21 and moved to another part of the country.\n\nThe case itself would just be an aberrant atrocity, except that the resulting support for the mullah, and for the girl’s family and its honor killing plans, have become emblematic of a broader failure to help Afghan women who have been victims of violence.\n\nThe result challenges hopes that Western aid and encouragement can make lasting headway on behalf of Afghan women, particularly in remote parts of the country where traditional customs are still stronger than modern law. Here, Taliban insurgents and pro-government elements often make common cause in their hatred of progress in women’s rights, most of which has come about with international funding and pressure.\n\nMost of the anger in Kunduz has been focused not on the mullah but on the women’s activists and the shelter, which is one of seven operated across Afghanistan by W omen for Afghan Women, an Afghan-run charity that is heavily dependent on American aid, from both government and private donors.\n\n“People know this office as the Americans’ office,” Dr. Sarwari said. “They all think the shelter is an American shelter. There isn’t a single American here,” she said.\n\n“W.A.W. is not American-run,” said Manizha Naderi, its executive director. “Every single staff member is an Afghan. They are from the communities we work in. Our only concern is to make sure women and girls are protected and that they get justice.”\n\nAs the Western withdrawal from Afghanistan has accelerated, rights advocates are seeing a sharp difference in their funding. “We already see the signs of losing the support of the international community,” said Ms. Geyah, in an interview before she resigned. “No one’s funding new civil society programs anymore. None of the foreigners show up anymore; they’re all in hiding. And I think what gains we have achieved the last 13 years, we’re slowly losing all of them.”\n\nThe accused mullah, Mohammad Amin, was arrested and confessed to having sex with the girl after Quran recitation classes at the mosque on May 1, but claimed that he thought the girl was older and that she responded to his advances.\n\nThe girl’s own testimony, and medical evidence, supported a rape so violent that it caused a fistula, or a break in the wall between the vagina and rectum, according to the police and the official bill of indictment. She bled so profusely after the attack that she was at one point in danger of losing her life because of a delay in getting medical care.\n\nAfter the two women’s officials began speaking out about the case, they started receiving threatening calls from mullahs — some of them Taliban, others on the government side — and from arbakai, or pro-government militiamen. One of their claims was that the girl was actually 17, and thus of marriageable age, not 10.\n\nPhotographs of the girl that Dr. Sarwari took in the hospital clearly show a pre-pubescent child, and the doctor said the girl weighed only 40 pounds. Few Afghans have birth records, and many do not know their precise ages. But the girl’s mother said she was 10, and a forensic examination in the hospital agreed, saying she had not yet started menstruating or developing secondary sexual characteristics.\n\nIn the photographs, which Dr. Sarwari displayed on her laptop computer recently, the girl has beautiful alabaster features and inky black hair cut in a pageboy style. She lay in her hospital bed under a quilted blanket with cartoon characters on it.\n\nMs. Geyah said she showed photos of the girl to government officials and prosecutors to prove that she was much too young to have consented. Dr. Sarwari said, “We wanted to give her a face, to make her real to them.”\n\nMs. Geyah said: “I went to the hospital when they brought her there. I was sitting next to her bed when I overheard her mother and aunt saying that her father was under tremendous pressure by the villagers to kill the girl because she had brought shame to them.”\n\nSuch honor killings in rape cases are common in Afghanistan, and are often more important to the victim’s family than vengeance against the attacker. Human rights groups say about 150 honor killings a year come to light, and many more probably go unreported.\n\nWhen Dr. Sarwari, who is a pediatrician, arrived to pick up the girl at the hospital, a crowd of village elders from Alti Gumbad, the girl’s home village on the outskirts of the city of Kunduz, were gathered outside the hospital; the girl’s brothers, father and uncle were among them. Inside, Dr. Sarwari encountered the girl’s aunt, who told her she had been ordered by her husband to sneak the girl out of the hospital and deliver her to the male relatives outside. “She said they wanted to take her and kill her, and dump her in the river,” Dr. Sarwari said.\n\nEfforts to reach the girl’s relatives by telephone were unsuccessful, and insurgent activity around Alti Gumbad made the village too dangerous for journalists to visit. “The girl’s family gave us a guarantee that they would not harm her,” said Sayed Sarwar Hussaini, head of the Kunduz police criminal investigation division. “We would not hand her back unless we were sure.”\n\nIn the hospital room, the doctor found the girl’s mother holding her child’s hand, and both were weeping. “My daughter, may dust and soil protect you now,” Dr. Sarwari quoted the mother as saying. “We will make you a bed of dust and soil. We will send you to the cemetery where you will be safe.”\n\nEven mothers here often believe that there is no choice but to kill rape victims, who are seen as unmarriageable and therefore a lifelong burden to their families, as well as a constant reminder of dishonor. “Their men feel they have to wash their shame with blood,” Dr. Sarwari said.\n\nThe doctor took the girl away to the shelter. Afterward, Dr. Sarwari and several women’s affairs officials were threatened by the girl’s family, and by other mullahs. “They call me and curse me, and threaten to kill me and my family, and say they know where I live,” Dr. Sarwari said. “They say, once your American husbands leave Afghanistan, we will do what we want to you.” (Her husband is an Afghan doctor and war veteran.)\n\nDr. Sarwari has accused prosecutors and religious officials of siding with the accused rapist and ignoring the child’s plight.\n\n“There are a lot of powerful people behind the mullah,” Dr. Sarwari said. The girl’s family knows they cannot do anything to Mr. Amin, she said, but “the girl is easy. They can get to her; she’s their daughter.” She said she feared the girl would either be killed, or forced to recant her accusations against the mullah.\n\nWomen for Afghan Women arranged for the girl to get medical treatment, and after she healed, she was returned to the shelter in Kunduz, about two weeks ago, until the police returned her to her family last Tuesday. Those caring for the girl said she had been terribly homesick and wanted to return to her family, but no one had the heart to tell her they had been conspiring to kill her.",

the latest this morning nic robertson cnn senior international correspondent the very latest 121 bodies recovered so far ninetyfive search and rescue people involved sent by the government here in kiev they say they are using 18 vehicles to get around but they are hampered they say in this recovery effort in the beginning of the investigation by the fact the debris is strewn over such a large area they also because the government doesnt control the territory there they also they are being hampered this time by armed separatist groups on the ground we have seen evidence that the crime scene as its called has been tampered with theres a possibility of debris and wreckage being removed the ukrainian government says it has already established a committee to begin an investigation that has malaysia the dutch government and the united states have had a hand in getting the committee established john berman and nic to be clear theres finger pointer going on in a serious nature the ukrainian government says they believe these it was these prorussian separatists who shot this plane down robertson indeed the president here and the head of the security chief presented evidence audio tapes video tapes they have made that they say are recordings of phone conversations between separatists and what they call their russian agents we can not independently verify these recordings but they do appear to indicate that the separatists fired at what they thought was a ukrainian military aircraft they have shot down at least two in recent days in that same area then theres a discovery you can hear it on the audio recordings no its not a military act its a civilian there is civilian bodies discovered women children and civilian effects suitcases holiday brochures discovered on the ground so the government here is saying this points very clearly that the separatists were involved again we can not independently verify those recorded phone conversations but the government convinced it was prorussian separatists that fired at the plane john berman and it comes at a very dangerous time a tense time for this region the russian president vladimir putin not saying it was the ukrainians that shot it down says the ukrainian government bears responsibility explain that robertson yes he doesnt say they are responsible for bringing the plane down he doesnt say that the separatists shot the plane down either but he does say that the ukrainian government because it reengaged in hostilities with those prorussian separatists is somehow responsible for what happened here we also know this morning the organization for security corporation in europe thats had monitoring teams here on the ground since the conflict got under way has a team headed in that area those pro russian separatists will get the international monitoring team access to the site there but it continues to be a very tense situation monitors from the same group have been held captive

clinton says the evidence looks pretty clear begin video clip hillary clinton former secretary of state there does seem to be some growing awareness that it probably had to be russian insurgents now how we determine that will require forensics but then if there is evidence pointing in that direction the equipment had to have come from russia what more the russians may or may not have done we dont know i read as i was walking in today to talk to you the russian stock market has dropped theres a great deal of concern that not only was a civilian plane shot down but what this means about the continuing conflict in eastern ukraine and the role russia is playing berman lets go to moscow now and bring in independent russian analyst maria lipman she joins us by phone maria thank you so much for joining us i want to talk about the statement and actions by the russian leader vladimir putin he has said the ukrainian government is responsible for the situation that brought down this plane however the russian leader has not said who pulled the trigger that fired this missile what do you make of his words so far can you please parse them for us maria lipman independent russian analyst via telephone what president putin implied by saying that the ukrainian government is responsible i think is happened in ukraine territory other than that i think president putin is being cautious and would not say who is to blame he also had a conversation with president obama last night shortly after the crash and hes somewhat blamed russian officials inaudible he informed president obama apparently president obama known about the tragedy before that however this conversation in itself i think shows president putin right now is being cautious is being careful he knows there are people pointing to russia as the responsible party and what he says is the ukrainian government is responsible it is ridiculous to blame russia and denies like they have before that there is any involvement of the russian military in the armed conflict in eastern ukraine baldesarra maria as someone whos written several books about putin and the media im very curious to know how russian television is covering this terrible tragedy right now especially because in eastern ukraine really russian television is all they are able to get lipman yes indeed eastern ukraine only receives russian television ukrainian television is blocked russian television some of the early reaction tried to suggest not to make statements but to suggest that it is the ukrainian side thats maybe to blame for that focusing on tragic episode many years ago when a passenger jet was hit over the ukrainian territory and it seemed at the time it was a military maneuver that was to blame for that and the suggestion that happened before his time also venturing some of the wildest theories this is what russian television did not necessarily citing it but they did not sound credible at all berman while those theories are played and replayed on russian television the fact remains at least according to us officials that several flights and planes military transport cargo planes have been shot down in this region very very recently including over the last several days by the prorussian separatists in eastern ukraine is there any russian response to that so far maria lipman well the russian respond to what goes on in eastern ukraine has beamed out theres a brutal operation by the ukrainian government ukrainian military and there are people who are referred to as militants or in other ways who are fighting for their cause going into detail is not part of the russian coverage however it is well known that planes have been down several times already during this conflict by the prorussian separatists this in itself serves as indirect evidence pointing to prorussian separatists as maybe responsible for the tragedy berman maria lipman in moscow for us thank you so much giving us an interesting perspective on the situation going on we appreciate your time in response to the downing of flight 17 the faa has now expanded us flight restrictions over eastern ukraine lipman yes and there are questions about the route flight 17 pilots took on their way to kuala lumpur most major airlines have been avoiding that air space for weeks and even months now because of this fighting below berman indra petersons is taking a look at the dangerous air space over the region good morning indra indra petersons ams meteorologist good morning its important to know this was not in a restricted air space for international air space or the faa the original air space included crimea peninsula and also portions of the black sea but nonetheless prior to the conflict we were seeing about 400 flights going to that border between eastern ukraine and russia but since the conflict time only 100 flights were going in this area now since the downing of the plane yesterday we have what the faa expanded the restricted zone now including eastern portions of ukraine just take a look though during the actual incident many planes were flying in that restricted or nonrestrictive air space they actually had about 21 planes in eastern ukraine so it was not the only plane there of course since the downing of the plane things drastically changed two hours after only six airlines in that region so definitely a lot of things are changing and evolving it would be important to note it was not restricted at the time berman it is now and i think it will dramatically affect how people look at conflicts in the future and commercial aviation over those conflicts indra thanks so much for that interesting look we are going to continue to follow the latest on who shot down malaysian flight 17 there are many many developments and some live events planned over the next several minutes but first breaking news in gaza israel launching a ground assault thousands warned to evacuate the tanks and troops have moved in and the violence it has already turned deadly we are live in gaza with the latest on this breaking story next commercial break berman welcome back breaking news right now the shooting down of malaysia airlines flight 17 over ukraine youre looking at live pictures now of a news conference in malaysia malaysian officials talking about the downing of this plane and the 198 souls lost on board lets listen right now unidentified male in the association of asia pacific airlines fly this route over ukraine european airlines also use the same route and traverse the same airspace in the hours before the incident a number of other passenger aircraft from different carriers used the same route there were no last minute instructions given to the pilots of mh17 to change the route of the flight earlier today malaysia airlines released a statement on the aircrafts service record which showed the aircraft had a clean bill of health they have also confirmed that all the aircrafts systems were functioning normally acars and the aircrafts transponders were working and transmitting as normal so ladies and gentlemen before i take your questions i would like to reiterate malaysias condemnation of any attack on innocent civilians its support for an independent international investigation and most of all its sympathies with those affected by this tragedy mh17 was carrying 298 passengers and crew our thoughts and prayers are with their families at what must be an incredibly difficult time unidentified male ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for session we will start the questions with the local media first following by the foreign and international so yes could you please identify yourself your name and agency that you represent speaking foreign language berman all right you have been watching a news conference by malaysian officials talking about the shooting down of malaysian airlines flight 17 over eastern ukraine the point that officials there i think wanted to make lara is that the route that this flight was taking was one that was taken by other planes european planes had been in that area i think theyre a bit defensive over the questions why this plane was over the war zone to begin with baldesarra absolutely and i think also because of what happened with the other malaysian airlines flight he the man he did say that this aircraft all systems were inspected they were functioning perfectly the aircraft was given a clean bill of health really just emphasizing what we already know that this plane was shot down berman he condemned what he called an attack on civilians when we come back well show you the weapon most likely used to shoot down the plane and what terrorists evil doers would have to do to carry out an attack like this commercial break baldesarra nearly 300 people killed on board and all killed when the jet liner was brown out of the air over eastern ukraine prorussian separatists are suspected in the attack and as tom foreman tells us the surfacetoair missile system apparently used to take down the jet was developed by the russians begin videotape tom foreman if you want to figure out what could have hit the plane you have to think about the circumstances of the plane at the time it was about 3200033000 feet in the air over ukraine it was about 30 miles away from the russian border so you can not hit this with a shoulder fired antiaircraft missile they are not strong enough what you need is something much more like this this is the buk antimissile system its one that is talked about in this case it is a fourman unit it has four readytofire missiles on top it can set up and fire quickly and it can move away after firing quickly those missiles have a tremendous amount of power lets bring one in and talk about that each one is 16 feet long we are showing them smaller here to make it fit it will weigh 1500 pounds and it has a 154pound warhead on it that means 154 pounds of high explosive it doesnt have to hit the target it just get close to it with electronic guidance systems it can get very close and in a short period of time 22 seconds from the time its radar acquires a target to the time it can be launched and look at the speed it travels at a top speed of 2684 miles per hour more than three times the speed of sound that means even if it were fired from 30 miles away it could have hit a plane like this in 40 seconds or less that means people on board would absolutely never ever see it coming end video clip berman all right our thanks to tom foreman for that i want to go back to the news conference in malaysia from government officials they are talking about the shooting down of malaysian airlines flight 17 they gave us the nationalities of the passengers that were verified there are 20 remain to be verified as of now they have no knowledge of americans on board but again 20 still remain to be verified lets listen back into the conference reporter the airline going forward in the future undentified male the prime minister contacted the president and prime ministers and they had several discussions inaudible the ambassadors in malaysia so we will give the support to the next of kin and any assistance to the families by the time this inaudible unidentified male that will be a separate issue i will just focus on mh17 unidentified male yes the gentleman standing reporter john starks from channel 4 news in the uk some airlines have decided to reroute their aircraft around ukraine do you accept now that a terrible mistake has been made by allowing mh17 to pass over ukraine unidentified male as i mentioned many times that this is an approved route by icao fifteen out of 16 inaudible used this route they are using this route unless theres other notice so all the times we are not doing any notice on this reporter hi im inaudible asia world i got two questions i know you mentioned the route is approved route but theres a war going on do you think it is wise to actually fly that route ph second question is do you intent to fly family members over ukraine",

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. \n\nANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.\n\n \n\nJOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: And we do begin with breaking news this morning. A passenger plane shot down over Ukraine, 298 people killed. \n\n \n\nNow, the hunt to find those responsible begins. Ukraine blaming pro- Russian militants, Russia blaming Ukraine for the situation. \n\n \n\nThis morning, live team coverage with new information we are learning about the crash. This morning, possible motives for the crime and the innocent passengers caught in this awful, awful cross fire. \n\n \n\nLARA BALDESARRA, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, certainly a lot to tell you about. \n\n \n\nGood morning. Welcome to EARLY START. I'm Lara Baldesarra, in for Christine Romans. \n\n \n\nBERMAN: And I am John Berman. It's Friday, July 18th, 4:00 a.m. in the East.\n\n \n\nAnd we begin with the very latest on the attack that brought down Malaysian Flight 17. Wreckage, human remains strewn across miles of Eastern Ukraine. This jet was blown out of the sky by what officials believe was a surface-to-air missile. \n\n \n\nAn administration source tells CNN that right now, the evidence points to pro-Russian separatists as the suspected attackers. President Obama warning the world is watching as concern grows as the crime scene, the area where this plane was brought down is being compromised. \n\n \n\nOur coverage of the crash of Flight 17 begins with senior international correspondent Nic Robertson live from Kiev. \n\n \n\nNic, what's the latest this morning? \n\n \n\nNIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The very latest, 121 bodies recovered so far. Ninety-five search and rescue people involved, sent by the government here in Kiev. They say they are using 18 vehicles to get around but they are hampered they say in this recovery effort in the beginning of the investigation by the fact the debris is strewn over such a large area. They also because the government doesn't control the territory there, they also they are being hampered this time by armed separatist groups on the ground. \n\n \n\nWe have seen evidence that the crime scene, as it's called, has been tampered with. There's a possibility of debris and wreckage being removed. The Ukrainian government says it has already established a committee to begin an investigation that has Malaysia, the Dutch government and the United States have had a hand in getting the committee established, John. \n\n \n\nBERMAN: And, Nic, to be clear, there's finger pointer going on in a serious nature. The Ukrainian government says they believe these it was these pro-Russian separatists who shot this plane down. \n\n \n\nROBERTSON: Indeed. The president here and the head of the security chief presented evidence, audio tapes, video tapes they have made that they say are recordings of phone conversations between separatists and what they call their Russian agents. We cannot independently verify these recordings, but they do appear to indicate that the separatists fired at what they thought was a Ukrainian military aircraft. They have shot down at least two in recent days in that same area. \n\n \n\nThen, there's a discovery. You can hear it on the audio recordings. No, it's not a military act, it's a civilian. There is civilian bodies discovered, women, children, and civilian effects, suitcases, holiday brochures discovered on the ground. \n\n \n\nSo, the government here is saying this points very clearly that the separatists were involved. Again, we cannot independently verify those recorded phone conversations, but the government convinced it was pro-Russian separatists that fired at the plane, John.\n\n \n\nBERMAN: And it comes at a very dangerous time, a tense time for this region. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, not saying it was the Ukrainians that shot it down says the Ukrainian government bears responsibility. Explain that. \n\n \n\nROBERTSON: Yes, he doesn't say they are responsible for bringing the plane down. He doesn't say that the separatists shot the plane down, either. But he does say that the Ukrainian government, because it reengaged in hostilities with those pro-Russian separatists is somehow responsible for what happened here. \n\n \n\nWe also know this morning the organization for security corporation in Europe that's had monitoring teams here on the ground since the conflict got under way has a team headed in that area. Those pro- Russian separatists will get the international monitoring team access to the site there. But it continues to be a very tense situation. Monitors from the same group have been held captive by the separatists in the past, John.\n\n \n\nBERMAN: Let's hope they can make it to the site, because what we need this morning, Nic, is facts. \n\n \n\nThank you so much, Nic Robertson, for us in Kiev, this morning. We'll check in with you in a bit. \n\n \n\nBALDESARRA: Well, what we do have are our witnesses and the people who witnessed Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 crashing in the rural area in Eastern Ukraine are describing what they say was a gruesome scene as the Boeing 777 exploded in the sky and everything rained down in bits and pieces, not just the plane itself, but the people inside. \n\n \n\nNow, one of the witnesses, freelance journalist Noah Sneider, he described the scene to CNN'S Anderson Cooper. \n\n \n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\nNOAH SNEIDER, FREELANCE JOURNALIST: My sense is that the rescue crews number one priority right now. Get as many bodies as they can and gather it under the gathering points. Some people are walking straight by them. It's also, you know, keep in mind, it's long grass. Like I said again, a really wide field and finding things like passports. \n\n \n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\nBERMAN: We are waiting to find out the identities of the 283 passengers and 15 crew members on board Malaysian Airlines Flight 17. \n\n \n\nPresident Obama reacting to the tragedy during an appearance in Delaware. \n\n \n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We'll offer any assistance we can to help determine what happened and why. As a country, our thoughts and prayers are with all the families and passengers, wherever they call home. \n\n \n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\nBERMAN: The president has directed Secretary of State John Kerry and the rest of his team to reach out to the countries directly impacted by the downing of Flight 17. The secretary released his own statement saying, quote, \"We are horrified by the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17. The United States government remains prepared to assist with a credible international investigation anyway we can and we will continue to be in touch with all relevant partners as we seek the facts of what happened.\" The U.S. joined a host of countries banning flights over Eastern Ukraine. \n\n \n\nAnd this morning, we learned the nationalities of many passengers and crew on board this flight. More than half, 154 were from the Netherlands, some of them believe to be heading to Australia to attend the 20th International AIDS Conference. Forty-five others were from Malaysia, 27 from Australia. So far, we don't have any word of victims from the United States, but, but, 41 of the fatalities and nationalities remain unverified. \n\n \n\nVladimir Putin, the Russian president, insisting Ukraine is responsible for the attack on Flight 17. The Russian president ordered the top military officials to provide the help needed to shed light on what he calls a criminal act. The Russian leader going on to say, \"There's no doubt the country whose territory this happened in bears responsibility. This tragedy would not have happened if there was peace in the country, if military operations had not resumed in the southeast of Ukraine.\"\n\n \n\nBALDESARRA: Well, U.S. officials have already determined the Ukrainian military did not have the ability to launch a missile from pro-Russian region where the attack took place. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says the evidence looks pretty clear. \n\n \n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\nHILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: There does seem to be some growing awareness that it probably had to be Russian insurgents. Now, how we determine that will require forensics but then if there is evidence pointing in that direction, the equipment had to have come from Russia. \n\n \n\nWhat more the Russians may or may not have done, we don't know. I read as I was walking in today to talk to you, the Russian stock market has dropped. There's a great deal of concern that not only was a civilian plane shot down, but what this means about the continuing conflict in eastern Ukraine and the role Russia is playing. \n\n \n\nBERMAN: Let's go to Moscow now and bring in independent Russian analyst Maria Lipman. She joins us by phone. \n\n \n\nMaria, thank you so much for joining us. \n\n \n\nI want to talk about the statement and actions by the Russian leader Vladimir Putin. He has said the Ukrainian government is responsible for the situation that brought down this plane. However, the Russian leader has not said who pulled the trigger that fired this missile. \n\n \n\nWhat do you make of his words so far? Can you please parse them for us?\n\n \n\nMARIA LIPMAN, INDEPENDENT RUSSIAN ANALYST (via telephone): What President Putin implied by saying that the Ukrainian government is responsible, I think, is happened in Ukraine territory. Other than that, I think president Putin is being cautious and would not say who is to blame. \n\n \n\nHe also had a conversation with President Obama last night, shortly after the crash and he's somewhat blamed Russian officials (INAUDIBLE), he informed President Obama -- apparently, President Obama known about the tragedy before that. \n\n \n\nHowever, this conversation in itself, I think, shows President Putin, right now, is being cautious, is being careful. He knows there are people pointing to Russia as the responsible party and what he says is the Ukrainian government is responsible. It is ridiculous to blame Russia and denies like they have before, that there is any involvement of the Russian military in the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. \n\n \n\nBALDESARRA: Maria, as someone who's written several books about Putin and the media, I'm very curious to know how Russian television is covering this terrible tragedy right now especially because in Eastern Ukraine, really Russian television is all they are able to get. \n\n \n\nLIPMAN: Yes, indeed. Eastern Ukraine only receives Russian television. Ukrainian television is blocked. Russian television, some of the early reaction tried to suggest -- not to make statements, but to suggest that it is the Ukrainian side that's maybe to blame for that focusing on tragic episode many years ago when a passenger jet was hit over the Ukrainian territory and it seemed, at the time, it was a military maneuver that was to blame for that. \n\n \n\nAnd the suggestion that happened before his time, also venturing some of the wildest theories. This is what Russian television did not necessarily citing it but they did not sound credible at all. \n\n \n\nBERMAN: While those theories are played and replayed on Russian television, the fact remains, at least according to U.S. officials, that several flights and planes, military transport, cargo planes have been shot down in this region very, very recently, including over the last several days by the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. \n\n \n\nIs there any Russian response to that so far, Maria? \n\n \n\nLIPMAN: Well, the Russian respond to what goes on in eastern Ukraine has beamed out. There's a brutal operation by the Ukrainian government, Ukrainian military. And there are people who are referred to as militants or in other ways who are fighting for their cause. Going into detail is not part of the Russian coverage. \n\n \n\nHowever, it is well known that planes have been down several times already during this conflict by the pro-Russian separatists. This, in itself, serves as indirect evidence pointing to pro-Russian separatists as maybe responsible for the tragedy. \n\n \n\nBERMAN: Maria Lipman in Moscow for us -- thank you so much, giving us an interesting perspective on the situation going on. We appreciate your time. \n\n \n\nIn response to the downing of Flight 17, the FAA has now expanded U.S. flight restrictions over Eastern Ukraine. \n\n \n\nLIPMAN: Yes, and there are questions about the route Flight 17 pilots took on their way to Kuala Lumpur. Most major airlines have been avoiding that air space for weeks and even months now, because of this fighting below. \n\n \n\nBERMAN: Indra Petersons is taking a look at the dangerous air space over the region. \n\n \n\nGood morning, Indra.\n\n \n\nINDRA PETERSONS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Good morning. \n\n \n\nIt's important to know, this was not in a restricted air space for international air space, or the FAA. The original air space included Crimea peninsula and also portions of the Black Sea. But, nonetheless, prior to the conflict, we were seeing about 400 flights going to that border, between eastern Ukraine and Russia. But since the conflict time, only 100 flights were going in this area.\n\n \n\nNow, since the downing of the plane yesterday, we have what the FAA expanded the restricted zone. Now, including eastern portions of Ukraine. Just take a look, though, during the actual incident. Many planes were flying in that restricted or non-restrictive air space. They actually had about 21 planes in Eastern Ukraine. So, it was not the only plane there. \n\n \n\nOf course, since the downing of the plane, things drastically changed. Two hours after, only six airlines in that region. So, definitely a lot of things are changing and evolving. It would be important to note it was not restricted at the time. \n\n \n\nBERMAN: It is now, and I think it will dramatically affect how people look at conflicts in the future and commercial aviation over those conflicts. Indra, thanks so much for that interesting look. \n\n \n\nWe are going to continue to follow the latest on who shot down Malaysian Flight 17. There are many, many developments and some live events planned over the next several minutes.\n\n \n\nBut, first, breaking news in Gaza. Israel launching a ground assault. Thousands warned to evacuate. The tanks and troops have moved in. And the violence, it has already turned deadly. We are live in Gaza with the latest on this breaking story, next. \n\n \n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n \n\nBERMAN: Welcome back. \n\n \n\nBreaking news right now: the shooting down of Malaysia airlines flight 17 over Ukraine. You're looking at live pictures now of a news conference in Malaysia. Malaysian officials talking about the downing of this plane and the 198 souls lost on board. \n\n \n\nLet's listen right now. \n\n \n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- in the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines fly this route over Ukraine. European airlines also use the same route, and traverse the same airspace. In the hours before the incident, a number of other passenger aircraft from different carriers used the same route.\n\n \n\nThere were no last minute instructions given to the pilots of MH17 to change the route of the flight. \n\n \n\nEarlier today, Malaysia Airlines released a statement on the aircraft's service record, which showed the aircraft had a clean bill of health. They have also confirmed that all the aircraft's systems were functioning normally. ACARS and the aircraft's transponders were working and transmitting as normal.\n\n \n\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, before I take your questions, I would like to reiterate Malaysia's condemnation of any attack on innocent civilians; its support for an independent international investigation; and most of all, its sympathies with those affected by this tragedy. MH17 was carrying 298 passengers and crew. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families at what must be an incredibly difficult time.\n\n \n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for session. We will start the questions with the local media first, following by the foreign and international. So -- yes. Could you please identify yourself, your name and agency that you represent? \n\n \n\n(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] \n\n \n\nBERMAN: All right. You have been watching a news conference by Malaysian officials talking about the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Eastern Ukraine. The point that officials there I think wanted to make, Lara, is that the route that this flight was taking was one that was taken by other planes. \n\n \n\nEuropean planes had been in that area. I think they're a bit defensive over the questions why this plane was over the war zone to begin with. \n\n \n\nBALDESARRA: Absolutely. And I think also, because of what happened with the other Malaysian Airlines flight, he -- the man he did say that this aircraft, all systems were inspected. They were functioning perfectly. The aircraft was given a clean bill of health. Really just emphasizing what we already know that, this plane was shot down. \n\n \n\nBERMAN: He condemned what he called an attack on civilians. \n\n \n\nWhen we come back, we'll show you the weapon most likely used to shoot down the plane. And what terrorists, evil doers would have to do to carry out an attack like this. \n\n \n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n \n\nBALDESARRA: Nearly 300 people killed on board and all killed when the jet liner was brown out of the air over eastern Ukraine. Pro-Russian separatists are suspected in the attack. And as Tom Foreman tells us, the surface-to-air missile system apparently used to take down the jet was developed by the Russians. \n\n \n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n \n\nTOM FOREMAN: If you want to figure out what could have hit the plane, you have to think about the circumstances of the plane at the time. It was about 32,000-33,000 feet in the air over Ukraine. It was about 30 miles away from the Russian border. So, you cannot hit this with a shoulder fired antiaircraft missile. They are not strong enough. \n\n \n\nWhat you need is something much more like this. This is the BUK antimissile system. It's one that is talked about in this case. It is a four-man unit. It has four ready-to-fire missiles on top. It can set up and fire quickly and it can move away after firing quickly. Those missiles have a tremendous amount of power. \n\n \n\nLet's bring one in and talk about that. Each one is 16 feet long. We are showing them smaller here to make it fit. It will weigh 1,500 pounds and it has a 154-pound warhead on it. That means 154 pounds of high explosive. \n\n \n\nIt doesn't have to hit the target, it just get close to it. With electronic guidance systems, it can get very close and in a short period of time, 22 seconds from the time it's radar acquires a target to the time it can be launched. \n\n \n\nAnd look at the speed. It travels at a top speed of 2,684 miles per hour, more than three times the speed of sound. That means even if it were fired from 30 miles away, it could have hit a plane like this in 40 seconds or less. That means people on board would absolutely never ever see it coming. \n\n \n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n \n\nBERMAN: All right. Our thanks to Tom Foreman for that. \n\n \n\nI want to go back to the news conference in Malaysia from government officials. They are talking about the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17. \n\n \n\nThey gave us the nationalities of the passengers that were verified. There are 20 remain to be verified. As of now, they have no knowledge of Americans on board. But again, 20 still remain to be verified. \n\n \n\nLet's listen back into the conference. \n\n \n\nREPORTER: -- the airline going forward in the future. \n\n \n\nUNDENTIFIED MALE: The prime minister contacted the president and prime ministers and they had several discussions. (INAUDIBLE) the ambassadors in Malaysia. So, we will give the support to the next of kin and any assistance to the families by the time this -- \n\n \n\n(INAUDIBLE) \n\n \n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That will be a separate issue. I will just focus on MH17. \n\n \n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, the gentleman standing. \n\n \n\nREPORTER: John Starks from Channel 4 News in the U.K. \n\n \n\nSome airlines have decided to reroute their aircraft around Ukraine. Do you accept, now, that a terrible mistake has been made by allowing MH17 to pass over Ukraine? \n\n \n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: As I mentioned many times that this is an approved route by ICAO. Fifteen out of 16 (INAUDIBLE) used this route. They are using this route unless there's other notice. So, all the times, we are not doing any notice on this. \n\n \n\nREPORTER: Hi, I'm (INAUDIBLE) Asia World.\n\n \n\nI got two questions. I know you mentioned the route is approved route, but there's a war going on. Do you think it is wise to actually fly that route (ph)? Second question is, do you intent to fly family members over Ukraine?",

It was flying between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe aircraft went missing near Donetsk, where pro-Russian rebels are fighting Ukrainian government forces. However, the rebels denied bringing down the aircraft and instead blamed the Ukrainian forces. The Ukraininan President also put out a robust denial that his forces were involved. One of the theories doing the rounds was that a ‘slack’ Ukraine force mistook the civilian aircraft for a ‘hostile’ plane.\n\nTV pictures from the scene showed a pall of smoke billowing from the stricken aircraft. Witnesses said charred debris and at least a hundred bodies were scattered over a 15-km radius, suggesting that the plane had exploded mid-air.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin was having a pre-planned telephone conversation with US President Barack Obama on the situation in Ukraine when it became known that the Malaysian airplane had crashed. It is understood that 23 US citizens were on board. The plane came down before entering Russian airspace.\n\nOnly the Ukrainian and the Russian army have the expertise to launch a missile that could have brought down an intercontinental aircraft flying at such high altitude.\n\nEarlier in the day the Ukrainian authorities had claimed that one of their fighter jets was shot down by an air-to-air missile from a Russian plane and Ukrainian troops were fired upon by missiles from a village inside Russia (see Page 5). Though in the last few months, a number of military aircraft have been downed in the area, this is the first commercial airline disaster resulting from the hostilities in Ukraine. The latest crash comes three months after the mysterious disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 which is thought to have crashed into the Indian Ocean.\n\nPILOTS IGNORED WARNING The jet was travelling at 33,000 feet when it disappeared. The Malaysian Airlines pilots ignored several warnings to avoid the airspace over Ukraine. It is understood that the jet had taken the Ukrainian route to save fuel as diverting north or south would have taken longer.\n\nAndrei Purgin, deputy prime minister of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the insurgent group in eastern Ukraine, denied in a telephone interview that the rebels had anything to do with the downing of the passenger jet. He said the rebels had shot down Ukrainian planes before but that their anti-aircraft weapons could only reach to around 4,000 meters, far below the level of passenger jets.\n\n“We don’t have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height,” he said. He said the plane apparently came down in an area of Ukrainian military operations and that it was not out of the question that Ukrainians themselves shot it down.\n\nUkraine’s president said in a statement that he was calling for an immediate investigation of the crash. He also dubbed it a terrorist act.",

            "text": "I am assuming it was shot down.\n\nA few observations:\n\n1. MANPAD (portable surface to air missile systems) have a typical maximum  altitude reach of 5000 m. †\n\n2. The aircraft was flying at 10,000 m. EUROCONTROL (EU air traffic control) has confined that the permitted airspace over Eastern Ukraine was for 10,000 m and above. Unless it had deviated from its permitted flight-path the plane was flying at 10,000 m or above.\n\n3. To shoot down an aircraft at this altitude requires an air defence system such as an S-300, a Buk or at least one of the precursors to the S-300 such as the SA-6. That is a serious system with a radar unit and a substantially sized rocket which needs to be mounted on some kind of vehicle.  The SA-6, which was used by the Yugoslav government in its ultimately unsuccessful  defence against NATO aggression in 1999, has a maximum altitude of 18,000 m.\n\nThe above are facts. The following is argument and some facts.\n\n1. The forces of the Kiev regime possess the Buk system. (This seems to be a fact).\n\n2. The rebels acknowledge possessing MANPADS\n\n3. While it may be the case that MANPADS have been smuggled into Eastern Ukraine from, say, the Caucuses, advanced air defence systems are a different matter. These are substantial systems. One imagines that even an army like the Russian army which is prone to a high level of pilfering will be able to keep track of its air defence systems.  A MANPAD can be transported in the boot of a car.  An advanced air defence system is typically a mobile and distinctive vehicle. Some systems require multiple vehicles. For these reasons it seems unlikely that there is a black-market in advanced kinds of radar based air defence systems. It also seems highly improbable that the Russians would have supplied such a system with all the obvious risk of detection.\n\nI don’t know. It could have been anyone.  In fact it isn’t even certain that the plane was shot down. But the Ukrainian forces seem as good as candidate as any if it was shot down.\n\nUpdate\n\nThe New York Times †† reports on this story. Here are some excerpts:\n\nGRABOVO, Ukraine — A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 with 298 people aboard exploded, crashed and burned on a flowered wheat field Thursday in a part of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russia separatists, blown out of the sky at 33,000 feet by what Ukrainian and American officials described as a Russian-made antiaircraft missile. “Everything we have, and it is not much, says separatists,” a senior Pentagon official said. “That said, there’s still a lot of conjecture.”\n\nIn fact the whole article is long on conjecture. Note the way the first paragraph mentions a “Russian-made antiaircraft missile”. In fact Ukraine (Kiev) operates the Buk (NATO reporting name SA-11) system †††. But why pass up a golden opportunity to mislead your readers and spread the State Department’s propaganda for them? The only actual evidence presented in the story (which seems to be based around an off-the-record briefing from the US military) is a YouTube audio file put out by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) purporting to be an intercepted phone call between a “separatist leader” and  Russian “intelligence commanders” in which the separatists admit to having accidentally shot down the plane. The US is now well-known for accepting fabricated “intelligence” from third-parties with the minimum of checks if it supports its current policy position. This was the case with much of the material which “justified” the Iraq invasion (the well-known forged document about yellowcake for example). Intelligence services in more than one country certainly see fabricating “intelligence” to get desired  political outcomes as part of their role. M16 had just such a programme in the lead up to the Iraq war. The  programme involved planting “intelligence” material which had been too low-grade to action by UNSCOM into the press in various UN member  countries in order to manipulate their UN votes. † † ††  It is as equally likely that the SBU audio is forged as a real intercept. The US State Department must know this. The New York  Times journalist should know this. But they (both) run the story anyway.\n\nThe New York Times piece is a nice example of American media propaganda. A story is stitched together from some loose phrases about “Russian-made” and an anonymous briefing about a YouTube video.  Even if it turns out that the rebels were responsible, the story is still an example of propaganda. For what it is worth something similar is happening over on RT where anonymous sources (presumably the Russian Defence Ministry) have been briefing that the Ukrainians (Kiev) moved Buk systems into that area recently. To my mind that sounds like more credible intelligence that an audio intercept where a “separatist leader” conveniently admits to a “Russian intelligence commander” that they shot it down, but I don’t  know.\n\nNotes\n\n† Australian government briefing paper: http://www.dfat.gov.au/security/manpads_countering_terrorist_threat.pdf\n\n†† http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/18/world/europe/malaysian-airlines-plane-ukraine.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&version=Banner&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news\n\n† † †  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buk_missile_system#cite_note-Janes2-64 &\n\nhttp://press.ihs.com/press-release/aerospace-defense-terrorism/ihs-janes-analysis-capabilities-ukraines-missile-systems\n\n† † ††  Scott Ritter and Williams Rivers Pitt War on Iraq Profile Books 2002.\n\nAdd to Favorites See Favorites Print article",

The jet was traveling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, and since the incident, Ukraine has accused the separatists of carrying out a “terrorist attack.”\n\nThe plane crashed and burned on a flowered wheat field, spewing debris across several square miles in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, near the Russian border. All those on board were killed which included 154 people that were Dutch, another 27 who were Australian and 23 Malaysian, 3 infants, and 15 crew members.\n\n\n\nRussia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, blamed Ukraine’s government for creating insurgency in eastern Ukraine. This incident has caused a great shock not only because this is the second Malaysia Airlines to suffer a mass-casualty flight disaster, but also brought about a new international crisis. Even Malaysia’s prime minister, Najib Razak was greatly taken aback at the news seeing as the flight was traveling on an approved and heavily trafficked route over eastern Ukraine before vanishing radar screens with no distress signal.\n\nMr. Najib told reporters in a televised statement\n\nThis is a tragic day in what has already been a tragic year for Malaysia. If it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice.\n\nPresident Obama also became involved and had a meeting with Mr. Najib where they\n\nMr. Putin expressed his condolences, but added that\n\nFlight MH-17 was flying at altitude of 33,000 feet before air-traffickers lost contact with the plane. Petro O. Poroshenko, Ukraine’s president said\n\nUkrainian Interior Ministry official Anton Gerashchenko even posted on Facebook\n\nJust now, over Torez, terrorists using a Buk anti-aircraft system kindly given to them by Putin have shot down a civilian airliner flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. There is no limit to the cynicism of Putin and his terrorists! Europe, USA, Canada, the civilized world, open your eyes! Help us in any way you can! This is a war of good against evil!\n\nSince the incident, Ukraine declared the eastern part of the country a no-fly zone, and all flights to Ukraine have been suspended for three days.\n\nOn Friday, The United Nations Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Ukraine, and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon urged a full international investigation.\n\nSOURCE: Japan Today & NYTimes",

left a monitor with the organization for security and cooperation in europe at the site of the crash in eastern ukraine on friday the united states government has concluded that the passenger jet felled over ukraine was shot down by a russianmade surfacetoair missile launched from rebelheld territory and most likely provided by russia to promoscow separatists officials said on friday while american officials are still investigating the chain of events leading to the destruction of malaysia airlines flight 17 on thursday they pointed to a series of indicators of russian involvement among other things military and intelligence officials said there was mounting evidence that a ukrainian military plane shot down three days earlier had been fired upon from inside russian territory by the same sort of missile battery used to bring down the civilian jet comment secret evidence is not evidence show us the evidence honestly you guys in the intelligence community dont exactly have a sterling reputation for the quality of your evidence you can probably therefore understand why most thinking people think youre full of crap the intelligence persuaded president obama to publicly lay responsibility at least indirectly at the door of the kremlin speaking at the white house he tried to channel international indignation toward russia for what he called an outrage of unspeakable proportions mr obama said the episode should be a wakeup call for europe and should snap everybodys heads to attention about what is going on in ukraine where a prorussia insurgency has become an international crisis comment obama must have had some brain circuits crossed yes it should be a wakeup call for europe that kiev and the us are madmen and need to be stopped without going into detail about the intelligence he had been shown mr obama said that the separatists had been armed and trained because of russian support highflying aircraft can not be shot down without sophisticated equipment and training he added and that is coming from russia comment its hard to go into detail when your intelligence is wholly imaginary he singled out president vladimir v putin of russia accusing him of waging a proxy war that led to the tragedy he has the most control over that situation mr obama said and so far at least he has not exercised it comment ha thats rich coming from the head of the us government proxy war specialist extraordinaire and no putin isnt waging a proxy war the usbacked regime in kiev is getting its butt whupped by people who refuse to bend the knee to a gang of inept murderous racist thugs if obama had a shred of moral decency hed be cheering them on not blaming putin for not stopping them russia denied involvement and suggested that ukraines military might have been responsible an assertion ukraine rejected mr putin called for talks saying all sides to the conflict must swiftly halt fighting and begin peace negotiations it is with great concern and sadness that we are watching what is happening in eastern ukraine its awful its a tragedy as investigators tried to sort out control of the crash site in the middle of a war zone and families mourned the victims the global revulsion at the downing of the plane grew particularly with the news that a number of aids researchers were among the dead european leaders joined mr obama in calling for an international investigation unimpeded by combatants and ukraine asked the united nations civil aviation authority to lead an investigation the president stated that an immediate ceasefire must take place in eastern ukraine to allow for an international investigation into the malaysian airline crash while separatists guarding the crash site allowed some ukrainian government rescue teams to enter and begin collecting bodies on friday the organization for security and cooperation in europe said the armed rebels had prevented its monitors from gaining full access to the site in order to secure a safe route for the investigation and salvaging operations one rebel even fired into the air as the monitors were leaving according to a spokesman for the organization michael bociurkiw who was there mr bociurkiw said bodies in the field were beginning to bloat a separatist leader said that the governments of the netherlands and malaysia had asked the rebels informally not to disturb the crime scene but that there were not enough refrigerators to keep the bodies there comment they even fired into the air oh how horrible among the 298 people who died when the plane came down was quinn lucas schansman 19 who was born in new york to a dutch father and had dual american and dutch citizenship mr schansman had been studying in amsterdam when he decided to fly to indonesia where his family was on a threeweek vacation he was headed over there to meet them said katinka wallace a relative mr schansmans facebook page indicated that he had moved to amsterdam on april 24 and had been in a relationship with a young woman since last year his favorite quotation was i have a dream on friday friends and relatives posted remembrances in dutch dear cousin and friend were going to miss you one wrote american intelligence agencies concluded that the boeing 777200 was struck by a russianmade sa11 missile fired from a rebelcontrolled area near the border in ukraine american analysts were focused on an area near the small towns of snizhne and torez about midway between the rebel strongholds of donetsk and luhansk their determination was based on an analysis of the launch plume and trajectory of the missile as detected by an american military spy satellite but the analysis did not pinpoint the origin of the missile launch or identify who launched it those are the milliondollar questions said a senior pentagon official who like others insisted on anonymity to discuss details of the analysis comment its easy to make stuff up when you dont have to use your real name heck its even easier to make up anonymous sources integrity is a quality lacking in the fields of journalism and intelligence these days although the separatists claimed to have captured a ukrainian sa11 battery in late june a senior american official said the system was not believed to be operational we have high confidence that it was not a ukrainian system the official said of the battery that shot down the malaysian plane we have reason to suspect that it could be a russiansupplied system comment and you have absolutely no reason of suspecting that it could be a ukrainian system mr senior american official is your imagination that crusty or are you just playing by the rules your masters dictate the downing of the ukrainian military transport plane on monday figured prominently in the evaluations western officials said there were strong indications that the missile that struck that plane an antonov26 came from the russian side of the border although the crash is still under investigation it was not clear whether the same missile battery brought down the malaysian aircraft on thursday but officials said that either way they believed the unit had been transported over the border from russia in recent days the ukrainian government released audio in which separatist rebels seemed to be discussing an sa11 missile system that was moved into eastern ukraine from russia just before the malaysian plane was destroyed american officials said that while they had not authenticated the tape they had no reason to doubt it and noted that the accents of the speakers and the scenario described seemed to fit existing information comment and you believe such an absurdity and publish it without comment in recent months russians have funneled tanks rockets artillery and antiaircraft weapons to the separatists according to american and european officials gen philip m breedlove the top nato commander warned last month that the russians had trained separatists to operate some of the heavy weaponry although he did not mention sa11 missiles specifically comment and you believe such an allegation without proof and publish it without comment at a briefing on friday rear adm john kirby the top pentagon spokesman said it would have been difficult for separatists to fire the sa11 without russian help it strains credulity to think that it could be used by separatists without at least some measure of russian support and technical assistance he said comment it strains credulity that you havent even mentioned the possibility that kiev might have been responsible but then you wouldnt would you ukraine released what it said was audio of phone calls between rebels and russian officers in one call a rebel is heard saying we have just shot down a plane admiral kirby raised the possibility that the russian military had transported the system into ukraine and even fired it whether it was a system that was driven across the border by russians and then handed off we dont know he said comment but that wont stop you from suggesting it was the case thus implanting the idea in all the sorry dupes who read shoddy nyt journalism separatist leaders on friday denied taking down the malaysian plane and russias foreign minister sergey v lavrov dismissed ukraines accusations of russian involvement in the last few months i have not heard practically any truthful statements from kiev he said comment ahh finally one truthful statement from a russian the russian defense ministry said at least five ukrainian air defense systems were within range to bring down the plane it said the flight path and crash site were within two areas where ukraine was operating a longrange s200 air defense system and where three squadrons were deployed with sa11 missile batteries ukraine denied that any of its forces had been involved and american officials said they believed that denial the boeing was outside the zone of possible destruction by the antiaircraft forces of ukraine andriy lysenko a spokesman for ukraines national security and defense council told reporters after months of trying to gently prod european allies to take tougher action against moscow for its intervention in ukraine mr obama decided to raise the diplomatic temperature on friday on both russia and american allies he sent his united nations ambassador samantha power to the security council to describe what she called credible evidence that the separatists were responsible ms power said she could not rule out technical assistance by russian personnel mr obama then went before the cameras himself at the white house to argue that whatever the investigation found russias aid to the insurgents had led to the disaster what we do know is that the violence thats taking place there is facilitated in part in large part because of russian support he said comment wrong the uss aid to the fascists in kiev led to this disaster the blood is on your hands obama he said europe should pay attention noting that most of the passengers were europeans including 189 from the netherlands that i think sadly brings home the degree to which the stakes are high for europe not simply for the ukrainian people mr obama said and that we have to be firm in our resolve he later called prime minister david cameron of britain and chancellor angela merkel of germany to talk about the disaster he also spoke with prime minister tony abbott of australia which had 27 passengers on board and vice president joseph r biden jr spoke with president petro o poroshenko of ukraine in their own public statements european leaders expressed outrage but showed little eagerness to escalate the confrontation with russia mr cameron whose country had nine citizens on board said those responsible must be brought to account ms merkel whose country had four passengers on board said there were many indications that the malaysian airliner had been shot down but declined to say whether she would support tougher sanctions",

Western officials said there were strong indications that the missile that struck that plane, an Antonov-26, came from the Russian side of the border, although the crash isIt waswhether the same missile battery brought down the Malaysian aircraft on Thursday, but officials said that either way, they believed the unit had been transported over the border from Russia in recent days. The Ukrainian government released audio in which separatist rebels seemed to be discussing an SA-11 missile system that was moved into eastern Ukraine from Russia just before the Malaysian plane was destroyed.American officials said that while they had, they had, and noted that the accents of the speakers and the scenario described seemed to fit existing information.In recent months, Russians have funneled tanks, rockets, artillery and antiaircraft weapons to the separatists,. Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, the top NATO commander, warned last month that the Russians had trained separatists to operate some of the heavy weaponry, although he did not mention SA-11 missiles specifically.At a briefing on Friday, Rear Adm. John Kirby, the top Pentagon spokesman, said it would have been difficult for separatists to fire the SA-11 without Russian help. \"It strains credulity to think that it could be used by separatists without at least some measure of Russian support and technical assistance,\" he said.Ukraine released whatwas audio of phone calls between rebels and Russian officers. In one call, a rebel is heard saying, \"We have just shot down a plane.\"Admiral Kirby raisedthat the Russian military had transported the system into Ukraine and even fired it. \"Whether it was a system that was driven across the border by Russians and then handed off,,\" he said.Separatist leaders on Friday denied taking down the Malaysian plane, and Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, dismissed Ukraine's accusations of Russian involvement. \",\" he said.Ukraine denied that any of its forces had been involved, and American officials said. \"The Boeing was outside the zone of possible destruction by the antiaircraft forces of Ukraine,\" Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters.After months of trying to gently prod European allies to take tougher action against Moscow for its intervention in Ukraine, Mr. Obama decided to raise the diplomatic temperature on Friday on both Russia and American allies. He sent his United Nations ambassador, Samantha Power, to the Security Council to describe what she called \"\" that the separatists were responsible. Ms. Power said she could not \"rule out technical assistance by Russian personnel.\"Mr. Obama then went before the cameras himself at the White House to argue that, Russia's aid to the insurgents had led to the disaster. \"What we do know is that the violence that's taking place there is facilitated in part, in large part, because of Russian support,\" he said.He said Europe should pay attention, noting that most of the passengers were Europeans, including 189 from the Netherlands. \"That, I think, sadly brings home the degree to which the stakes are high for Europe, not simply for the Ukrainian people,\" Mr. Obama said, \"and that we have to be firm in our resolve.\"He later called Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to talk about the disaster. He also spoke with Prime Minister Tony Abbott of Australia, which had 27 passengers on board, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke with President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine.In their own public statements, European leaders expressed outrage but showed little eagerness to escalate the confrontation with Russia. Mr. Cameron, whose country had nine citizens on board, said \"those responsible must be brought to account.\" Ms. Merkel, whose country had four passengers on board, said there were \"many indications\" that the Malaysian airliner had been \"shot down\" but declined to say whether she would support tougher sanctions.",

            "text": "Grabovo (Ukraine), July 17: A Malaysian airliner crashed and burned over eastern Ukraine today, killing all 295 aboard, sharply raising the stakes in a conflict between the western-backed government and pro-Moscow rebels who accused each other of shooting it down. Kiev accused “terrorists” — militants fighting to unite eastern Ukraine with Russia — of hitting the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 with a heavy, Soviet-era ground-to-air missile as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Rebel leaders hurled a counter charge. But half an hour before the last reported contact with the airliner, their Russian commander had claimed the shooting of an Antonov An-26, a Ukrainian military transport plane, in the same area — their third such kill this week. Reuters journalists saw burning and charred wreckage bearing the red and blue Malaysia insignia and dozens of bodies strewn in fields near the village of Grabovo, 40km from the Russian border near the rebel-held regional capital of Donetsk. The aircraft would be the first passenger plane to fall victim to the hostilities in Ukraine that have claimed hundreds of lives since pro-western protests toppled the Moscow-backed President in Kiev in February and Russia annexed Crimea a month later. The scale of the disaster affecting scores of foreigners —reports said the dead include 23 Americans and four French nationals — could prove a turning point for international pressure to resolve the crisis. As word came in of the crash, Russian and US leaders Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama were discussing the West’s latest economic sanctions on Moscow, imposed yesterday to get Putin to do more to curb the revolt against Kiev’s western-backed government. They noted the early reports of the crash during their phone call, the White House said, adding that Obama, who called it a “terrible tragedy”, had warned of further sanctions if Moscow did not change course in Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines said air traffic controllers lost contact with flight MH-17 around 7.45pm Indian time as it flew towards the Russian border, carrying 280 passengers and 15 crew members. Flight tracking data indicated it was at its cruising altitude of 33,000ft. “I was working in the field on my tractor when I heard the sound of a plane and then a bang and shots,” a man in Grabovo said. “Then I saw the plane hit the ground and break in two. There was thick black smoke.” An emergency worker said at least 100 bodies had been found so far and the debris was spread over 15km. Late tonight, pro-Russian separatists claimed to have found the “black box” flight recorder. “MH-17 is not an incident or catastrophe, it is a terrorist attack,” Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tweeted. The loss of the MH-17 is the second disaster for Malaysia Airlines this year, following the mysterious disappearance of flight MH-370 in March with 239 people aboard on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. On Facebook, Ukrainian interior ministry official Anton Gerashchenko claimed that “terrorists using a Buk anti-aircraft system kindly given to them by Putin” had shot the airliner down. He added: “There is no limit to the cynicism of Putin and his terrorists! Europe, USA, Canada, the civilised world, open your eyes! Help us in any way you can! This is a war of good against evil!” Separatist leader Andrei Purgin, however, said the rebels’ anti-aircraft weapons could only reach to around 4,000 metres — far below the level of passenger jets. “We don’t have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height,” he said. Purgin said he was not aware whether the rebels owned Buk missile launchers but, even if they did, they had no fighters capable of operating them. But American news agency Associated Press said its journalists had seen a similar launcher near the eastern Ukrainian town of Snezhnoye earlier today. This appeared to tie in with Gerashchenko’s post about people in eastern Ukraine reporting seeing a Buk system moved from the town of Torez towards the town of Snezhnoye. The Buk missile system can fire missiles up to an altitude of 72,000ft. Purgin said the MH-17 came down in an area of Ukrainian military operations and it was not out of the question that the Ukrainians themselves shot it down. “Remember the Black Sea plane disaster,” Purgin said, referring to the 2001 shooting of an Israel-bound Russian airliner that the Ukrainians shot down by accident during a military training exercise, killing all 78 on board. A “shocked” Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib Razak, said he was launching “an immediate investigation”. Lufthansa of Germany and Turkish Airlines said their planes would steer clear of east Ukrainian air space. An Air India official said none of the airline’s planes flies over Ukraine. American and European aviation safety authorities had warned pilots in April about the potential risks of flying in or near Ukrainian airspace. The US Federal Aviation Administration’s April 23 “special notice” remains in effect until April 23 next year.. Several Ukrainian planes and helicopters have been shot down in four months of fighting in the area. Ukraine had said an An-26 was shot down on Monday and one of its Sukhoi Su-25 fighters on Wednesday by an air-to-air missile � Kiev’s strongest accusation yet of direct Russian involvement, since the rebels do not appear to have access to aircraft. Moscow has denied its forces are involved in any way. Passenger planes that have been shot down include a South Korean airliner that a Soviet jet fighter targeted in 1983 after it had strayed into Russian air space, killing all 269 aboard. In 1988, the US warship Vincennes downed an Iranian airliner over the Gulf, killing all 290 passengers and crew, in what Washington said was an accident after crew mistook the plane for a fighter. Tehran called it a deliberate attack.",

back in the 80s when i was travelling regularly between london and bangkok the flightpath went over kabul you could see the flashes of the russian artillery firing the shells hitting the ground and something on fire the point being that the taliban then had stinger missiles but hand held missiles then and now could not reach an airliner at over 30000ft at 560mph so it was safe obviously something has potentially changed with the type of weapons being supplied",

            "text": "Posted 2014-07-18 00:57:21\n\nMalaysia Airlines plane MH17\n\n\n\n\n\n MOSCOW — Malaysia Airlines said Thursday that it lost contact with an airliner that was flying in Ukrainian airspace, raising fears that the plane may have been shot down over eastern Ukraine.\n\n\n\n “We lost contact with Flight MH17 in Ukraine,” said Najmuddin Abdullah, who works in Malaysia Airlines’ press office.\n\n\n\n An adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister wrote on Facebook that a Buk antiaircraft missile system shot down the plane over the village of Torez, about 25 miles east of the city of Donetsk and within territory held by pro-Russian separatist rebels.\n\n\n\n The plane was carrying 280 passengers and 15 crew members, Anton Herashenko, the Interior Ministry adviser, wrote on his Facebook page, without revealing how he knew the information. He blamed the rebels for the attack.\n\n\n\n An adviser to Ukraine's interior minister says a Malaysian passenger plane carrying 295 people has been shot down over a town in the east of the country. (AP)\n\nRebel spokesmen denied responsibility, shifting blame to Ukrainian government forces. The Ukrainian government said it had nothing to do with downing the plane.\n\n\n\n “We do not exclude that this plane was shot down, and we stress that the Armed Forces of Ukraine did not take action against any airborne targets,” Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said in a statement. “We are sure that those who are guilty in this tragedy will be held responsible.”\n\n\n\n “Malaysia Airlines has lost contact of MH17 from Amsterdam,” the airline said on Twitter. “The last known position was over Ukrainian airspace. More details to follow.”\n\n\n\n In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a Twitter post that “at this time,” the United States does not have “any confirmation of cause, individuals on plane” or additional details.\n\n\n\n Near the end of a Thursday morning phone conversation with President Obama, Russian President Vladi­mir Putin “noted the early reports of a downed passenger jet near the Russia-Ukraine border,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Obama was being briefed on further developments , officials said.\n\n\n\n The plane was on its usual flight path and did not appear to have deviated from previous routes used by MH17 in any significant way, the airline data firm FlightAware reported.\n\nHerashenko said on Facebook that “local patriots” reported the movement of the Buk missile system Thursday morning from Torez in the direction of Sneznoye. He said the Malaysian plane was flying at 10,000 meters en route to Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\n\n The missile system was “generously provided” to the rebels by Putin, Herashenko charged. “There is no limit to the cynicism of Putin and his terrorists!” he said.\n\n\n\n “Europe, Canada, the USA, the civilized world — open your eyes! Help us with everything you can!” he pleaded.\n\n\n\n Herashenko said video from the site shows that “some jerks were shouting: Look, how wonderful it is burning! Beautiful!”\n\n\n\n For their part, leaders of the separatists’ self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic denied any involvement in bringing down the airliner.\n\n\n\n “The plane was shot down by the Ukrainian side,” said Serhiy Kavtaradze, a member of the rebels’ security council, according to the Russia’s Interfax news agency. “We simply do not have such air defense systems.” He said rebels’ shoulder-launched antiaircraft missiles “have a firing range of only 3,000 to 4,000 meters” and that passenger jets fly at much higher altitudes.\n\n\n\n Kavtaradze expressed condolences to the victims’ families on behalf of separatist leaders, Interfax reported.\n\n\n\n “It is obvious that people died,” he said. “This is very dreadful news.”\n\n\n\n The Ukrainian State Air Traffic Services Enterprise said it has launched an investigation into the incident.\n\n\n\n Andrei Purgin, the first deputy prime minister of the Donetsk People’s Republic, said the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 could have been brought down by Ukrainian forces.\n\n\n\n “Very serious clashes are ongoing in the region where the Boeing crashed,” he told Interfax. “Non-top gunfire is under way there.”\n\n\n\n He denied that the rebels possess the SA-17 Buk air-defense as Kiev alleges.\n\n\n\n However, the Associated Press reported that a similar launcher was seen by the agency’s journalists near the eastern Ukrainian town of Snizhne earlier Thursday. The Buk missile system can fire missiles up to an altitude of 22,000 meters (72,000 feet), AP said.\n\n\n\n Ukrainian authorities said Thursday that a Ukrainian air force Su-25 jet was shot down by an air-to-air missile from a Russian plane Wednesday evening, forcing the pilot to bail out.\n\n\n\n The downing of the close-air-support jet provided further evidence of direct Russian support for the separatist insurgents in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said. Ukraine charged that a military transport plane was shot down Monday by a missile fired from Russian territory.\n\n\n\n The rebels claimed responsibility for strikes Wednesday on two Ukrainian Su-25 jets, AP reported. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said the second jet was hit by a portable surface-to-air missile but the pilot was unharmed and managed to land the plane safely.\n\n\n\n -- Washington Post 2014-07-18",

The press conferences by malaysian airlines are just as pathetic for this crash, as they were 3 months ago when their last plane was lost! Posted 11:00 pm, 07/19/2014 alonzo, I noticed that, too. Can't help but wonder why on earth the pilots would fly into a danger zone. If they had stayed on course they wouldn't have been in the disputed area. Posted 10:56 pm, 07/19/2014 Some people was saying that there was dead bodies falling and crashing in their houses and laying in gardens. Posted 10:14 pm, 07/19/2014 Not to excuse the shooting down of a passenger plane, but the Obama=backed Kiev regime in Ukraine has been indiscriminately bombing cities in eastern Ukraine for weeks; killing hundreds if not thousands of innocent civilians.\n\n\n\nNary a protest raised? Posted 6:32 am, 07/19/2014 Airlines including Qantas Airways and Air Berlin altered their flight paths months ago to avoid Ukrainian air space after fighting flared up in the region, raising questions about why others did not do the same. The issue of whether to avoid flying over conflict zones has come into sharp focus since the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 on Thursday with 298 people in board. Posted 6:24 am, 07/19/2014 Why single out this plane when the route is heavily traveled by other air traffic? There's more to this than meets the eye. Posted 6:17 am, 07/19/2014 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/...6975/Putin\n\n\n\nIs this proof that MH17 change course into a war zone? A route map compiled by Twitter user Vagelis Karmiros using data from flight-tracking website Flightaware claims to show how the doomed Malaysia Airlines plane took a different flightpath to the ones taken by the previous ten MH17 flights Posted 12:39 am, 07/19/2014 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/...6975/Putin Posted 11:29 pm, 07/18/2014 There is a skunk in the wood pile somewhere with the Malaysian airliner that just 'disappeared' and this one that flew into a known restricted air space and was blown up. Definitely a skunk in the woodpile as we will someday find out. Posted 11:20 pm, 07/18/2014 I see Umpire is using his favorite slang words and working hard to prove everyone wrong, looking for a bar fight as usual. Posted 11:05 pm, 07/18/2014 NOW STUPIDARSE, HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT? Posted 11:03 pm, 07/18/2014 This was an active war zone that commercial aircraft have been avoiding for months. Why was this plane instructed by flight controllers into a restricted zone?\n\n\n\nSomeone benefits from escalating chaos. Barry? Posted 12:27 am, 07/18/2014 Actually try at least 1961. You forgot Bay of Pigs Posted 10:59 pm, 07/17/2014 It was definitely a Russian missile, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. The US has been selling weapons to terrorists since at least 1985 (Arms for Hostages), so God knows what the terrorists have -\n\n\n\n Ukraine accused the separatists of carrying out what it called a terrorist attack. American intelligence and military officials said the plane had been destroyed by a Russian SA-series missile, based on surveillance satellite data that showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not its point of origin. There were strong indications that those responsible may have errantly downed what they had thought was a military aircraft only to discover, to their shock, that they had struck a civilian airliner.\n\n http://www.nytimes.com/2014....html?_r=0 Posted 10:48 pm, 07/17/2014 Okay say it was a small terrorist group, well somebody provided them with access to a weapon that could cause such destruction. Posted 10:37 pm, 07/17/2014 monsterhunter (view profile) I could care less. Keep your butt in USA and take care of our own problems.\n\n\n\n \n\n Posted 10:33 pm, 07/17/2014 Let them and Russia battle it out. Posted 10:32 pm, 07/17/2014 US has enough problems stay out of it and stay home take care of the problems here u will have more than a hand full. Posted 10:32 pm, 07/17/2014 I can understand helping to find who did it, because if it's a terrorist group then our planes could be next. And it's better to join the fight with Malaysia than go it on our own later.\n\n\n\nBut the articles keep saying that this will have a negative impact on relations between the US and Russia, with the US placing more tariffs on Russian businesses. But the Ukraine is a completely separate country from Russia, and even has a different President. So why would this have any impact at all? Posted 10:27 pm, 07/17/2014 I could care less.

responsibility friday for the downing of a civilian jetliner a dispute emerged over who seized the planes flight recorders which could shed light on the planes last moments the voice and datarecording devices that had been aboard the malaysia airlines plane were said to be missing from the crash site in eastern ukraine a scene of carnage that remained unsecured friday kostyantyn batozsky adviser to the donetsk regional governor said in a telephone news conference that the aircraft voice and data recording devices had been recovered by workers from the ukrainian emergency services ministry who had been granted access to the crash site by rebels who control the region surrounding it but he said he did not know the current location of the devices or who had possession of them after a malaysia airlines jet crashed in ukraine on thursday several amateur videos were posted online he also said he had no intention of tampering with the black boxes because he said they would prove that the separatists were not guilty of shooting down the plane it is very much in our interests to have the most serious and dispassionate review of this issue by all international experts he said we will allow any international experts to the place of downing of the plane the russian and ukrainian governments both sharply denied any responsibility for the apparent surfacetoair missile strike that ripped the boeing 777200 from the sky thursday afternoon killing the 298 people aboard in light of the new global implications of the conflict ukrainian officials said that the investigation would be an international one with aviation experts from the netherlands malaysia and the united states invited to participate russian officials were adamant that they had nothing to do with the disaster continuing to point fingers at the ukrainian government and military in view of various types of speculation concerning operations of the russian armed forces in the areas bordering ukraine we affirm that the antiaircraft means of the russian armed forces did not operate in that region on july 17 the defense ministry said in a statement posted on its website russia also said that its air force was not flying in the areas bordering donetsk on thursday the ukrainian government likewise denied any role in the downing of the jet at that moment ukrainian fighter jets did not fly in the ukrainian airspace and the boeing was outside the zone of possible destruction by the antiaircraft forces of ukraine a spokesman for ukraines national security and defense council andriy lysenko said at a news briefing in kiev the capital officials in the united states confirmed late thursday that flight 17 had been shot down over grabovo by what they described as a russianmade antiaircraft missile fighting in eastern ukraine between the ukrainian military and prorussian separatists has been marked by the successful use of missiles against aircraft at higher and higher altitudes the downing on thursday of flight 17 struck at 33000 feet was the first at cruising altitude for modern commercial jets however the russian defense statementnoted that units of the ukrainian army possessed the buk m1 air defense missile launchers that officials said were most likely responsible for bringing the jetliner down much of the speculation surrounding the crash has focused on that system particularly since the prorussian separatist forces in eastern ukraine bragged on social media in late june that they had taken possession of a buk system after capturing a ukrainian military base the crash remained the subject of intense debate in the small ukrainian town of grabovo as residents tried to come to grips with what had unfolded in the fields where they work just yards from their homes two villagers said quietly that they had seen the flash of a rocket in the sky around the time the plane went down victor who said he was too afraid to give his last name said that he had been in his garden at the time and that he had seen the light coming from a rocket he said it had come from the direction of snizhne a city where the ukrainians have been bombing rebel positions frequently for more than a week it was a rocket im sure of it he said the other villager sergei 15 who also did not want to give his last name said he had been swimming in a nearby river when he saw what appeared to be a rocket being launched into the sky he said he had jumped out of the water hopped on his motorbike and sped home as a cloudy dawn came the full horror of the field was on display small white pieces of cloth dotted the grassy farmland marking the spots of bodies four rebels in fatigues were wandering through the ruins looking through peoples belongings and riffling through guidebooks and bags when asked who was responsible for the crash they looked incredulous and said that it had of course been the ukrainian military this wasnt ours said a rebel who identified himself only as alexei standing looking at an overhead bin in the grass with a rifle over his shoulder why would we do this were not animals the smell of flesh hung heavily near a broken hulk of metal on the road where a body lay splayed a foot with part of a leg was lying on the road the plane appeared to have broken apart at a great height and pieces were scattered across fields for several miles the two wings lay akimbo as if pushed forward on impact the plane was full of fuel when it crashed and the fire near the engine was fierce turning the twisted metal remains into molten pools that had hardened by morning this is direct provocation of the eu and the us said a rebel alexander nikolaevich who was walking along the road near the scene you see our weapons he said pointing to his aging gun we started to win the war and the fascists did this to stop us when asked if the fight would continue he said a little bit in malaysia there was mourning on a ramadan friday malaysians shocked at the loss of a second malaysia airlines boeing 777200 — it has been just four months since a plane disappeared en route to beijing from kuala lumpur — openly wondered why flight 17 was flying over a conflict in eastern ukraine where increasingly powerful surfacetoair missiles were being used in a statement delivered before dawn in kuala lumpur prime minister najib razak of malaysia pointedly noted that the international civil aviation organization had declared the airspace safe and that the international air transport association had not restricted travel there we must — and we will — find out precisely what happened

said repeatedly that the aircraft had been following a safe route that malaysia airlines had used for many years and that was still used by most asian airlines and by many european airlines including on the day of the crash during that period of time there are also many other aircraft using the same route he said european and ukrainian air traffic controllers had continued to route civil flights over the contested area even as the fighting worsened — and even as flights directed by russian air traffic controllers had apparently started to avoid it ukrainian intelligence has pointed to a fighter named igor bezler the militia leader in the eastern town of gorlovka saying in an intercepted phone call that his men had shot down a plane on thursday several assassinations are believed to have happened under mr bezlers watch soon after his forces took gorlovka and he took responsibility for killing a number of ukrainian militiamen in the town of volnovakha some weeks ago according to russian internet sources he was born in 1965 in crimea and studied in russia he served in the russian military but moved back to ukraine in 2003 where he began to work as the head of security for a factory in gorlovka biographies also note that he had worked in a company that performed burial services but was fired in 2012 he has been wanted by the ukrainian authorities since april 2014 mr bezlers nom de guerre is bes which in russian sounds like the first syllable of his last name but also means demon there are rumors that mr bezler does not get along with other militia leaders and that he has had street battles with the vostok battalion though rebels have dismissed those allegations in a slickly produced video called heroes of novorossii the name of the selfdeclared insurgent region mr bezler was shown wearing a light blue beret he had blue eyes and a long mustache in a recent interview with the russian news agency ria novosti he claimed to be holding 14 ukrainian soldiers hostage and said that the ukrainian military had fallen apart much like the condition of the russian military in the early 1990s in the interview mr bezler said he was a russian passport holder but had a residency permit in ukraine he said he sang the national anthem of the soviet union every morning and usually went to bed around 1030 pm he confirmed that he had worked as head of security for the gorlovka factory and claimed that he was fired from the burial services company over a fight with the local mayor who he said was demanding bribes peter marosszeky a longtime aircraft engineer and former senior executive at qantas panam and american airlines who advised boeing on the development of the 777 aircraft said in a telephone interview that the 777200 had an extremely long range and would have enough fuel to divert around a dangerous area during a 12hour flight if the pilots chose to do so but he said that airlines have typically not worried until now about surfacetoair missiles reaching planes at cruising altitude because only a very large missile with a lot of fuel could ascend such a distance mr marosszeky expressed skepticism that militiamen could readily fire such a large missile without training as well as cooperation from whoever owned or manufactured the missile youve got to have special codes and so forth to operate these things he said while international experts put the blame on whoever fired the missile questions about why commercial air traffic was continuing in the area — and about when air traffic should be stopped over similar areas of fighting in the future — could prove difficult to answer the investigation into the loss of flight 17 is laden with potential disputes over sovereignty mark a dombroff a partner focusing on the aviation industry at mckenna long aldridge a national law firm in the united states said that legal precedents indicated that if a plane is downed by military action the lead country in the investigation is the one over whose territory the plane was shot down that appears to be ukraine in this case — but the rebels in eastern ukraine where the plane crashed do not recognize the leadership in kiev and may try to claim the lead role in the investigation one of the most complicated factors is getting investigators on the ground in hostile territory mr dombroff said ukraine or the rebels — or both — could decide to transfer leadership of the crash investigation either to the country of registry of the aircraft which would be malaysia or to the country of manufacture for the aircraft which would be the united states where the boeing 777 was made leading a crash investigation is in some ways a formality for developing countries as most of the worlds investigators with crash experience tend to come from countries that manufacture aircraft and certify their airworthiness russias proximity to the crash site close ties to the rebels and extensive aviation experience means that it could try to play a sizable advisory role the crash is another setback for malaysia airlines which has already been struggling to recover from the loss of flight 370 which vanished on march 8 during a redeye flight from kuala lumpur to beijing the enduring mystery over flight 370 has already severely hurt demand for malaysia airlines tickets forcing the airline to offer budget carrier prices even though it bears the costs of a fullservice airline the financial penalty on malaysia airlines was clear on friday morning when two planes one from cathay pacific and one from malaysia airlines left hong kong international airport five minutes apart both bound for kuala lumpur the cathay pacific was sold out in every class of service and was so overbooked that the airline took the unusual step of calling at least one passenger at home the night before the flight and telling him that he had been involuntarily bounced to the flight operated by malaysia airlines for which cathay pacific has a shared marketing code by contrast the malaysia airlines flight was at least onethird empty the bulk of the passengers appeared to have come from two separate companies that were holding meetings in kuala

            "text": ".\n\nMalaysia Airlines flight MH17: ‘Second black box recovered’ from crash site\n\nUkraine’s emergency services have found two black boxes at the crash site of the downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, the governor of eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region has been quoted as saying.\n\nTwo black boxes were found by our emergency services. I have no information on where these boxes are at the moment,” Kostyantyn Batovsky told the Interfax-Ukraine news agency.\n\nPro-Russian separatists in the region said on Thursday they had found one black box when the Malaysian airliner came down between Krasni Luch in Luhansk region and Shakhtarsk in the neighbouring region of Donetsk.\n\nThe Interfax-Ukraine news agency had claimed the first black box has been sent to Moscow for analysis, the BBC reported. The news agency now reports a second black box has been recovered at the crash site.\n\nHowever, separatist leader Aleksandr Borodai told the Associated Press: “No black boxes have been found … We hope that experts will track them down and create a picture of what has happened.”\n\nA spokesman for the Emergencies Ministry in Kiev declined to comment on the report.\n\nMeanwhile, the Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has been quoted as saying Russia does not plan to take the “black box” flight recorders from downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in territory held by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine,\n\nThe United States called for an immediate ceasefire on Friday to allow easy access to the crash site, while pro-Russian separatists told the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), a security and rights body, they would ensure safe access for international experts visiting the scene.\n\n“As a matter of priority, they (the separatists) shall close off the site of the catastrophe and allow local authorities to start preparations for the recovery of bodies,” the OSCE said in a statement.\n\nRead more:\n\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17-rebels-recover-second-black-box-from-crash-site-9614158.html\n\n*****************************\n\nBy JULY 18, 2014\n\n The New York Times\n\nGRABOVO, Ukraine — As Russia, Ukraine and the rebels who are battling to break away from it denied responsibility Friday for the downing of a civilian jetliner, a dispute emerged over who seized the plane’s flight recorders, which could shed light on the plane’s last moments.\n\nThe voice and data-recording devices that had been aboard the Malaysia Airlines plane were said to be missing from the crash site in eastern Ukraine, a scene of carnage that remained unsecured Friday.\n\nKostyantyn Batozsky, adviser to the Donetsk regional governor, said in a telephone news conference that the aircraft voice and data recording devices had been recovered by workers from the Ukrainian Emergency Services Ministry who had been granted access to the crash site by rebels who control the region surrounding it. But he said he did not know the current location of the devices or who had possession of them.\n\nAfter a Malaysia Airlines jet crashed in Ukraine on Thursday, several amateur videos were posted online.\n\nHe also said he had no intention of tampering with the black boxes because he said they would prove that the separatists were not guilty of shooting down the plane. “It is very much in our interests to have the most serious and dispassionate review of this issue by all international experts,” he said. “We will allow any international experts to the place of downing of the plane.”\n\nThe Russian and Ukrainian governments both sharply denied any responsibility for the apparent surface-to-air missile strike that ripped the Boeing 777-200 from the sky Thursday afternoon, killing the 298 people aboard.\n\nIn light of the new global implications of the conflict, Ukrainian officials said that the investigation would be an international one, with aviation experts from the Netherlands, Malaysia and the United States invited to participate.\n\nRussian officials were adamant that they had nothing to do with the disaster, continuing to point fingers at the Ukrainian government and military.\n\n“In view of various types of speculation concerning operations of the Russian armed forces in the areas bordering Ukraine, we affirm that the antiaircraft means of the Russian armed forces did not operate in that region on July 17,” the defense ministry said in a statement posted on its website.\n\nRussia also said that its air force was not flying in the areas bordering Donetsk on Thursday.\n\nThe Ukrainian government likewise denied any role in the downing of the jet.\n\n“At that moment, Ukrainian fighter jets did not fly in the Ukrainian airspace and the Boeing was outside the zone of possible destruction by the antiaircraft forces of Ukraine,” a spokesman for Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, Andriy Lysenko, said at a news briefing in Kiev, the capital.\n\nOfficials in the United States confirmed late Thursday that Flight 17 had been shot down over Grabovo by what they described as a Russian-made antiaircraft missile. Fighting in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian military and pro-Russian separatists has been marked by the successful use of missiles against aircraft at higher and higher altitudes. The downing on Thursday of Flight 17, struck at 33,000 feet, was the first at cruising altitude for modern commercial jets, however.\n\nThe Russian defense statementnoted that units of the Ukrainian Army possessed the BUK M1 air defense missile launchers that officials said were most likely responsible for bringing the jetliner down. Much of the speculation surrounding the crash has focused on that system, particularly since the pro-Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine bragged on social media in late June that they had taken possession of a BUK system after capturing a Ukrainian military base.\n\nThe crash remained the subject of intense debate in the small Ukrainian town of Grabovo, as residents tried to come to grips with what had unfolded in the fields where they work, just yards from their homes.\n\nTwo villagers said quietly that they had seen the flash of a rocket in the sky around the time the plane went down. Victor, who said he was too afraid to give his last name, said that he had been in his garden at the time and that he had seen “the light coming from a rocket.”\n\nHe said it had come from the direction of Snizhne, a city where the Ukrainians have been bombing rebel positions frequently for more than a week. “It was a rocket, I’m sure of it,” he said.\n\nThe other villager, Sergei, 15, who also did not want to give his last name, said he had been swimming in a nearby river when he saw what appeared to be a rocket being launched into the sky. He said he had jumped out of the water, hopped on his motorbike and sped home.\n\nAs a cloudy dawn came, the full horror of the field was on display. Small white pieces of cloth dotted the grassy farmland, marking the spots of bodies.\n\nFour rebels in fatigues were wandering through the ruins, looking through people’s belongings and riffling through guidebooks and bags. When asked who was responsible for the crash, they looked incredulous and said that it had of course been the Ukrainian military.\n\n“This wasn’t ours,” said a rebel who identified himself only as Alexei, standing looking at an overhead bin in the grass with a rifle over his shoulder. “Why would we do this? We’re not animals.”\n\nThe smell of flesh hung heavily near a broken hulk of metal on the road where a body lay splayed. A foot with part of a leg was lying on the road.\n\nThe plane appeared to have broken apart at a great height, and pieces were scattered across fields for several miles. The two wings lay akimbo, as if pushed forward on impact. The plane was full of fuel when it crashed and the fire near the engine was fierce, turning the twisted metal remains into molten pools that had hardened by morning.\n\n“This is direct provocation of the E.U. and the U.S.,” said a rebel, Alexander Nikolaevich, who was walking along the road near the scene. “You see our weapons,” he said pointing to his aging gun. “We started to win the war and the fascists did this to stop us.”\n\nWhen asked if the fight would continue, he said, “a little bit.”\n\nIn Malaysia, there was mourning on a Ramadan Friday. Malaysians, shocked at the loss of a second Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200 — it has been just four months since a plane  disappeared en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur — openly wondered why Flight 17 was flying over a conflict in eastern Ukraine where increasingly powerful surface-to-air missiles were being used.\n\nIn a statement delivered before dawn in Kuala Lumpur, Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia pointedly noted that the International Civil Aviation Organization had declared the airspace safe and that the International Air Transport Association had not restricted travel there. “We must — and we will — find out precisely what happened to this flight,” he said.\n\nPeppered with questions about the aircraft’s route at a news conference late on Thursday afternoon at a Kuala Lumpur airport hotel, Liow Tiong Lai, Malaysia’s transport minister, said repeatedly that the aircraft had been following a safe route that Malaysia Airlines had used for many years and that was still used by most Asian airlines and by many European airlines, including on the day of the crash. “During that period of time, there are also many other aircraft using the same route,” he said.\n\nEuropean and Ukrainian air traffic controllers had continued to route civil flights over the contested area even as the fighting worsened — and even as flights directed by Russian air traffic controllers had apparently started to avoid it.\n\nUkrainian intelligence has pointed to a fighter named Igor Bezler, the militia leader in the eastern town of Gorlovka, saying in an intercepted phone call that his men had “shot down a plane” on Thursday. Several assassinations are believed to have happened under Mr. Bezler’s watch soon after his forces took Gorlovka, and he took responsibility for killing a number of Ukrainian militiamen in the town of Volnovakha some weeks ago.\n\nAccording to Russian Internet sources, he was born in 1965 in Crimea, and studied in Russia. He served in the Russian military but moved back to Ukraine in 2003, where he began to work as the head of security for a factory in Gorlovka. Biographies also note that he had worked in a company that performed burial services but was fired in 2012. He has been wanted by the Ukrainian authorities since April 2014.\n\nMr. Bezler’s nom de guerre is Bes, which in Russian sounds like the first syllable of his last name, but also means demon. There are rumors that Mr. Bezler does not get along with other militia leaders, and that he has had street battles with the Vostok Battalion, though rebels have dismissed those allegations.\n\nIn a slickly produced video called “Heroes of Novorossii,” the name of the self-declared insurgent region, Mr. Bezler was shown wearing a light blue beret. He had blue eyes and a long mustache. In a recent interview with the Russian news agency RIA Novosti, he claimed to be holding 14 Ukrainian soldiers hostage and said that the Ukrainian military had fallen apart, “much like the condition of the Russian military in the early 1990s.”\n\nIn the interview, Mr. Bezler said he was a Russian passport holder but had a residency permit in Ukraine. He said he sang the national anthem of the Soviet Union every morning, and usually went to bed around 10:30 p.m. He confirmed that he had worked as head of security for the Gorlovka factory, and claimed that he was fired from the burial services company over a fight with the local mayor who he said was demanding bribes.\n\nPeter Marosszeky, a longtime aircraft engineer and former senior executive at Qantas, PanAm and American Airlines who advised Boeing on the development of the 777 aircraft, said in a telephone interview that the 777-200 had an extremely long range and would have enough fuel to divert around a dangerous area during a 12-hour flight if the pilots chose to do so.

While international experts put the blame on whoever fired the missile, questions about why commercial air traffic was continuing in the area — and about when air traffic should be stopped over similar areas of fighting in the future — could prove difficult to answer. The investigation into the loss of Flight 17 is laden with potential disputes over sovereignty. Mark A. Dombroff, a partner focusing on the aviation industry at McKenna Long & Aldridge, a national law firm in the United States, said that legal precedents indicated that if a plane is downed by military action, the lead country in the investigation is the one over whose territory the plane was shot down. That appears to be Ukraine in this case — but the rebels in eastern Ukraine, where the plane crashed, do not recognize the leadership in Kiev and may try to claim the lead role in the investigation. “One of the most complicated factors is getting investigators on the ground in hostile territory,” Mr. Dombroff said. Ukraine or the rebels — or both — could decide to transfer leadership of the crash investigation either to the country of registry of the aircraft, which would be Malaysia, or to the country of manufacture for the aircraft, which would be the United States, where the Boeing 777 was made. Leading a crash investigation is in some ways a formality for developing countries, as most of the world’s investigators with crash experience tend to come from countries that manufacture aircraft and certify their airworthiness. Russia’s proximity to the crash site, close ties to the rebels and extensive aviation experience means that it could try to play a sizable advisory role. The crash is another setback for Malaysia Airlines, which has already been struggling to recover from the loss of Flight 370, which vanished on March 8 during a red-eye flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The enduring mystery over Flight 370 has already severely hurt demand for Malaysia Airlines tickets, forcing the airline to offer budget carrier prices even though it bears the costs of a full-service airline. The financial penalty on Malaysia Airlines was clear on Friday morning when two planes, one from Cathay Pacific and one from Malaysia Airlines, left Hong Kong International Airport five minutes apart, both bound for Kuala Lumpur. The Cathay Pacific was sold out in every class of service, and was so overbooked that the airline took the unusual step of calling at least one passenger at home the night before the flight and telling him that he had been involuntarily bounced to the flight operated by Malaysia Airlines, for which Cathay  Pacific has a shared marketing code. By contrast, the Malaysia Airlines flight was at least one-third empty. The bulk of the passengers appeared to have come from two separate companies that were holding meetings in Kuala Lumpur and had bought blocks of tickets for their employees to get there at discounted prices. Both Korean Airlines and Asiana Airlines have confirmed that they have not flown planes through Ukrainian airspace since March 3. “We detoured our flight because of political instability there,” said Lee Hyo-min, a spokeswoman at Asiana, which had been flying a cargo plane through Ukrainian airspace once a week from Brussels to Incheon, South Korea, until that point. Korean Airlines had been sending 42 passenger and cargo flights per month through Ukrainian airspace, but those flights had been rerouted, beginning on March 3, company officials said.

Poroshenko, said in a statement that he was calling for an immediate investigation of the crashed flight, a Boeing 777. He did not rule out that it might have been shot down.\n\nEastern Ukraine has been roiled for months by a violent pro-Russian separatist uprising in which a number of military aircraft have been downed. But this would be the first commercial airline disaster resulting from the hostilities in Ukraine.\n\nMalaysia Airlines, still reeling from the mysterious loss of another Boeing 777 flight in March, said it had lost contact with a flight, MH17, from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur over Ukraine but offered no further details immediately. Malaysia’s prime minister, Mohd Najib Tun Razak, said in a Twitter post that he was “shocked by reports that an MH plane crashed. We are launching an immediate investigation.”\n\nHishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia’s defense minister, responded to reports that the aircraft had disappeared and might have been shot down by posting a series of terse messages on Twitter: “Monitoring this closely,” said one. In another, he referred to the ministry of defense in saying that, “I have directed MINDEF to get confirmation.”\n\nAndrei Purgin, deputy prime minister of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the insurgent group in eastern Ukraine, denied in a telephone interview that the rebels had anything to do with the downing of the passenger jet. He said the rebels had shot down Ukrainian planes before but that their anti-aircraft weapons could only reach to around 4,000 meters, far below the level of passenger jets.\n\n“We don’t have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height,” he said. He said the plane apparently came down in an area of Ukrainian military operations and that it was not out of the question that Ukrainians themselves shot it down.\n\n“Remember the Black Sea plane disaster,” he said, referring to the 2001 shooting of a passenger jet bound for Israel that the Ukrainians shot down by accident during a military training exercise.",

and not ukraine its ambassador to malaysia said today this situation is quite unique the area is a war zone i think the international community should be flexible about that and act in a way acceptable to all sides russian ambassador to malaysia lyudmila vorobyeva said in a news conference russia has been calling for a fair thorough and full investigation led by international civil aviation organization icao since the beginning she said under icao rules the country where the incident happened in this case ukraine should lead the investigation malaysia airlines flight mh17 was shot down last week in eastern ukraine killing all 298 passengers and crew on board the aircrafts black boxes which could hold information about the crash in rebelheld eastern ukraine were handed to malaysian officials this morning weve been calling for an investigation lead by icao the reason for that is that the rebels as we understand do not trust the government of kiev said vorobyeva thats why they were reluctant to hand over anything including the black boxes to the ukrainian side because they are afraid the evidence would be tampered with reuters mh17 did not deviate kuala lumpur malaysia airlines said yesterday that mh17 did not deviate from its planned flight route in a statement to the new straits times the airline said as confirmed by malaysia airlines director of

statement on mh17 agreement in recent days we have been working behind the scenes to establish contact with those in charge of the mh17 crash site that contact has now been made under difficult and fluid circumstances we have been discussing the problems that have occupied us all securing vital evidence from the aircraft launching an independent investigation and above all recovering the remains of those who lost their lives tonight we have established the basis of an agreement to do just that earlier this evening i spoke to alexander borodai who is in command of the region where the tragedy occurred we have agreed the following firstly the remains of 282 people currently in torez will be moved by train to kharkiv where they will be handed over to representatives from the netherlands the train will depart this evening ukraine time and will be accompanied by six malaysian members of the recovery team the remains will then be flown to amsterdam on board a dutch c130 hercules together with the malaysian team following any necessary forensic work the remains of malaysian citizens will then be flown home to malaysia secondly at approximately 9pm tonight ukraine time the two black boxes will be handed over to a malaysian team in donetsk who will take custody of them thirdly independent international investigators will be guaranteed safe access to the crash site to begin a full investigation of the incident i must stress that although agreement has been reached there remain a number of steps required before it is completed there is work still to be done work which relies on continued communication in good faith mr borodai and his people have so far given their cooperation i ask that all parties continue to work together to ensure that this agreement is honoured that the remains of our people are returned that the black box is handed over and that the international team is granted full access to the site only then can the investigation into mh17 truly begin only then can the victims be afforded the respect they deserve we need to know what caused the plane to crash and who was responsible for it so that justice may be done in recent days there were times i wanted to give greater voice to the anger and grief that the malaysian people feel and that i feel but sometimes we must work quietly in the service of a better outcome i understand that for the families nothing can undo this damage the lives taken can not be given back the dignity lost can not be regained my heart reaches out to those whose loved ones were lost on mh17 we hope and pray that the

supported rebels accused of shooting down plane says john kerry australian newlyweds escape mh17 tragedy earlier today president obama called on russian president vladimir putin to compel russianbacked separatists to stop interfering with the probe of the plane that was hit thursday by a missile obama speaking from the south lawn of the white house said russianbacked separatists who are controlling the 10mile site need to allow investigators to recover bodies he said they had previously fired their weapons in the air when investigators approached the scene and have tampered with evidence russia and president putin in particular has a direct responsibility to compel them to cooperate with the investigation obama said more than 270 bodies have been recovered at the site authorities said with the hope of transporting the bodies to amsterdam the bodies have been loaded onto a refrigerated train a team of international monitors including three from the dutch national forensic investigations team and two american investigators arrived in eastern ukraine today and began studying the wreckage obama also said that if russia continued to support violence against the ukrainian people it would face further isolation from the international community obama said he hopes to see the dispute settled diplomatically the chaotic recovery effort continued ahead of a vote expected today by the un security council on an australiaproposed resolution demanding international access to the crash site and a ceasefire around the area australian prime minister tony abbott said his country would view a russian veto of the resolution very badly adding that no reasonable person could object to its wording having these people in control of the site is like leaving criminals in control of a crime scene abbott said of the russianbacked rebels pressure has been growing on russian president vladimir putin who the us and others say has backed and armed the rebels to rein in the insurgents in ukraine and allow a fullscale investigation the rebels have been blamed around the world for downing the plane though putin blamed ukraines government in a statement released prior to obamas comments putin blamed ukraine authorities for reigniting fighting with the prorussian rebels who control the crash region it is necessary that all the people who are responsible for the situation in the region improved their responsibility to their own people and to the peoples of those countries whose representatives have been victims of this disaster the statement read this morning

we stopped flying over ukraine because of safety concerns asiana spokeswoman lee hyomin said korean air moved its flight paths 250 kilometres 160 miles south of ukraine from march 3 due to the

had deemed the flight path secure the aircrafts flight route was declared safe by the international civil aviation organization and the international air transportation association has stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions he said rerouting would have involved a longer flighttime and therefore higher fuel costs singapore airlines said in a statement that it had been using ukrainian airspace but had rerouted all our flights to alternative corridors away from the region it was not immediately clear when the route change was put into affect hong

body eurocontrol the ukrainian authorities declared the east of the country a nofly zone shortly after the malaysian airliner went down with 298 people on board european and us airlines rerouted their flights as kiev said flight mh17 was shot down in a terrorist attack and a us official said intelligence analysts strongly believe it was downed by a surfacetoair missile eurocontrol said the doomed plane was flying at a level known as 330 or approximately 10000 metres or 33000 feet when it disappeared from radar screens the route itself had been closed to level 320 but was cleared for those flying at the malaysian planes altitude gerry soejatman a consultant with the jakartabased whitesky aviation chartered flight provider said airlines that flew over conflict zones were not necessarily negligent every airline does its own risk assessment soejatman said adding that flying above 30000 feet was generally considered secure given the level of training and sophisticated weaponry required to shoot down a plane at that height ten years ago youd be an idiot to fly over iraq below 15000 feet but over 30000 feet was very safe so its about the level of risk i think this will send a message to airlines to have a closer look at conflict zones when they choose to fly over them and gain a better understanding of what equipment is on the ground he said air india and thai airways said they had both started rerouting flights away from ukraine as a direct result of the malaysian crash some of our flights used to pass through ukrainian airspace but as of today all of our flights are

downed the crash came with tensions already soaring after kiev accused russia of downing a ukrainian military plane on a mission over the east of the country that allegation came a day after the us and eu bolstered sanctions against russia over its perceived support of the separatist insurgency in the exsoviet state moscow condemned the punitive measures as blackmail and warned of retaliatory

jonathan beale bbc news a defence expert has told the bbc that shooting down a plane at 10000m 97 miles would have required a long range surfacetoair missile possibly guided by radar that suggests it is unlikely it could have been downed by a portable air defence missile or manpad which has a much shorter range the only other possibility is for an aircraft at that height to be downed by a fighter

Ukraine on Monday said the bodies will be taken to the Netherlands.\n\nThe bodies, which were placed in rail wagons, were inspected by Dutch investigators on Monday in Torez, before the train set off for Kharkiv.\n\nMalaysia on Tuesday received two black boxes recovered at the crash site from pro-Russian rebels. One of the boxes will contain all conversation in the cockpit and another all flight data.\n\nHowever, it is unclear how useful this will be in determining what happened to the flight, which is believed by Kiev and world leaders to have been shot down by a surface-to-air-missile.\n\nMH17 was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it crashed in rebel-held east Ukraine. 298 people were killed, and 193 of the victims were Dutch.\n\n--Channel News Asia\n\nMH17: Probe Should Be Done By “International Community”, Not Ukraine - Russia\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Russia has called for the investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines MH17 to be led by the \"international community\" and not Ukraine, its ambassador to Malaysia said today.\n\n\"This situation is quite unique, the area is a war zone. I think the international community should be flexible about that and act in a way acceptable to all sides,\" Russian ambassador to Malaysia Lyudmila Vorobyeva said in a news conference.\n\n\"Russia has been calling for a fair, thorough and full investigation led by International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) since the beginning,\" she said.\n\nUnder ICAO rules the country where the incident happened, in this case Ukraine, should lead the investigation.\n\nMalaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down last week in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board. The aircraft's black boxes, which could hold information about the crash in rebel-held eastern Ukraine, were handed to Malaysian officials this morning.\n\n\"We've been calling for an investigation lead by ICAO. The reason for that is that the rebels, as we understand do not trust the government of Kiev,\" said Vorobyeva.\n\n\"That's why they were reluctant to hand over anything (including) the black boxes to the Ukrainian side because they are afraid the evidence would be tampered with.\"\n\n- Reuters\n\n‘MH17 Did Not Deviate’\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia Airlines said yesterday that MH17 did not deviate from its planned flight route.\n\nIn a statement to the New Straits Times, the airline said: “As confirmed by Malaysia Airlines’ director of operations, Captain Izham Ismail, during the press briefing at Sama-Sama Hotel on July 19, 2014, MH17 did not deviate from its flight plan route”.\n\nThe national carrier said based on its flight tracking system, the aircraft did follow its flight plan.\n\n“To maintain its assigned track, the flight computer system will adjust the heading to cater for wind changes.”\n\n- New Straits Times\n\nPrime Minister Najib Razak Statement On MH17 Agreement\n\nIn recent days, we have been working behind the scenes to establish contact with those in charge of the MH17 crash site.\n\nThat contact has now been made. Under difficult and fluid circumstances, we have been discussing the problems that have occupied us all: securing vital evidence from the aircraft, launching an independent investigation, and above all recovering the remains of those who lost their lives.\n\nTonight, we have established the basis of an agreement to do just that.\n\nEarlier this evening I spoke to Alexander Borodai, who is in command of the region where the tragedy occurred. We have agreed the following:\n\nFirstly, the remains of 282 people, currently in Torez, will be moved by train to Kharkiv, where they will be handed over to representatives from the Netherlands. The train will depart this evening Ukraine time, and will be accompanied by six Malaysian members of the recovery team. The remains will then be flown to Amsterdam on board a Dutch C130 Hercules, together with the Malaysian team. Following any necessary forensic work, the remains of Malaysian citizens will then be flown home to Malaysia.\n\nSecondly, at approximately 9pm tonight Ukraine time, the two black boxes will be handed over to a Malaysian team in Donetsk, who will take custody of them.\n\nThirdly, independent international investigators will be guaranteed safe access to the crash site to begin a full investigation of the incident.\n\nI must stress that although agreement has been reached, there remain a number of steps required before it is completed.\n\nThere is work still to be done, work which relies on continued communication in good faith. Mr Borodai and his people have so far given their co-operation.\n\nI ask that all parties continue to work together to ensure that this agreement is honoured; that the remains of our people are returned, that the black box is handed over, and that the international team is granted full access to the site.\n\nOnly then can the investigation into MH17 truly begin; only then can the victims be afforded the respect they deserve. We need to know what caused the plane to crash, and who was responsible for it, so that justice may be done.\n\nIn recent days, there were times I wanted to give greater voice to the anger and grief that the Malaysian people feel. And that I feel. But sometimes, we must work quietly in the service of a better outcome.\n\nI understand that for the families, nothing can undo this damage. The lives taken cannot be given back; the dignity lost cannot be regained.\n\nMy heart reaches out to those whose loved ones were lost on MH17. We hope and pray that the agreement reached tonight helps bring them a clear step towards closure.\n\n--Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak- Prime Minister\n\nVerified Facebook Account\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/najibrazak\n\nMalaysia Airlines' Two Black Boxes 'To Be Handed Over' To Investigators, Says Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak\n\nAs fighting raged in Ukraine’s Donetsk region -- compounding to further unrest following the downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane that left 298 people dead, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said today that the jetliner's two black boxes \"will be handed over to a Malaysian team in Donetsk, who will take custody of them.\"\n\n\"In recent days, we have been working behind the scenes to establish contact with those in charge of the MH17 crash site,\" he said. \"That contact has now been made. Under difficult and fluid circumstances, we have been discussing the problems that have occupied us all: securing vital evidence from the aircraft, launching an independent investigation, and above all recovering the remains of those who lost their lives.\"\n\nIt is unclear who currently is in custody of the black boxes.\n\nPresident Obama On Russian Separatists: ‘What Exactly Are They Trying To Hide’\n\n‘Enormous Array of Facts’ That Russia Supported Rebels Accused of Shooting Down Plane, Says John Kerry\n\nAustralian Newlyweds Escape MH17 Tragedy\n\nEarlier today, President Obama called on Russian President Vladimir Putin \"to compel\" Russian-backed separatists to stop interfering with the probe of the plane that was hit Thursday by a missile.\n\nObama, speaking from the South Lawn of the White House, said Russian-backed separatists, who are controlling the 10-mile site, need to allow investigators to recover bodies. He said they had previously fired their weapons in the air when investigators approached the scene and have tampered with evidence.\n\n\"Russia, and President Putin in particular, has a direct responsibility to compel them to cooperate with the investigation,\" Obama said.\n\nMore than 270 bodies have been recovered at the site, authorities said, with the hope of transporting the bodies to Amsterdam. The bodies have been loaded onto a refrigerated train.\n\nA team of international monitors, including three from the Dutch National Forensic Investigations Team and two American investigators, arrived in eastern Ukraine today and began studying the wreckage.\n\nObama also said that if Russia continued to support violence against the Ukrainian people, it would face further isolation from the international community. Obama said he hopes to see the dispute settled diplomatically.\n\nThe chaotic recovery effort continued ahead of a vote expected today by the U.N. Security Council on an Australia-proposed resolution demanding international access to the crash site and a cease-fire around the area.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said his country would view a Russian veto of the resolution \"very badly,\" adding that \"no reasonable person\" could object to its wording.\n\n“Having these people in control of the site is like leaving criminals in control of a crime scene,” Abbott said of the Russian-backed rebels.\n\nPressure has been growing on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who the U.S. and others say has backed and armed the rebels, to rein in the insurgents in Ukraine and allow a full-scale investigation. The rebels have been blamed around the world for downing the plane, though Putin blamed Ukraine's government.\n\nIn a statement released prior to Obama's comments, Putin blamed Ukraine authorities for reigniting fighting with the pro-Russian rebels who control the crash region.\n\n“It is necessary that all the people who are responsible for the situation in the region improved their responsibility to their own people and to the peoples of those countries whose representatives have been victims of this disaster,” the statement read.\n\nThis morning, local rescue workers had piled 21 black body bags by the side of the road in Hrabove, Ukraine. It was unclear how quickly they would be transported to refrigerated rail cars in the nearby town of Torez, where nearly 200 other passengers remained in boxcars at a train station.\n\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, whose country lost 192 citizens on the plane, told a news conference that repatriating the bodies was his \"No. 1 priority.\"\n\n-ABC News\n\nMH17: 'He Doesn't Understand Who The Rebels Are. He Just Wants His Mother To Come Home'\n\nMuhriz Marzaidi, 10, is the son of Mastura Mustafa, a 40-year-old mother and air hostess, who was killed on Flight MH17 last week\n\n\"He doesn't understand why this happened in Ukraine, or who the rebels are,\" said Hamdan Jaafar, the boy's uncle. \"He just asks about when he will receive the body. When it will come home.\"\n\nMuhriz's mother was Mastura Mustafa, a 40-year-old air stewardess who was one of 15 crew members on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 when it crashed.\n\nEver since Flight MH370 disappeared on its way to China in March, Ms Mustafa had refused to take shifts on planes travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. She feared the hostility of angry Chinese passengers, relatives said. But she had no qualms about continuing to fly, a passion since she joined the company at the age of just 18.\n\nMunriah Mustafa, her 52-year-old sister, recalled how a teenage Mastura had secretly snuck off to an interview with the airline because she believed her parents would not approve of her globe-trotting ambitions.\n\n\"She was always very focused on her work but family always came first,\" she added.\n\nTen years ago, that family was blessed with a new member: a baby boy who was named Muhriz Marzaidi.\n\nIn Ms Mustafa's sitting room, shelves crammed with photographs of her son and books such as \"The Boots Guide to Pregnancy\" and \"The Secret Language of Babies\" pay testament to her enthusiasm for motherhood.\n\nMr Jaafar, 54, described his sister-in-law as a doting mother.\n\n\"Every time she came back she'd bring something for her son: toys, or maybe chocolate, a T-shirt,\" he said.\n\nSometimes Muhriz was even allowed to join his mother on her trips abroad. In recent years he had flown to Cape Town and London, his uncle said. \"He would get very excited.\"\n\nMuhriz was asleep when news of his mother's death reached his family home at around midnight last Thursday. It came via her brother who also works at Malaysia Airlines and had seen a copy of the MH17 flight manifest.\n\nWhen Muhriz woke the next day for \"suhoor\", the daily predawn meal taken by Muslims before Ramadan fasting, he sensed something was wrong.\n\n\"He stood up and said that he had dreamed of his mum, all dressed in white, saying that she would not be coming back,\" said his uncle. \"She told the boy that her time had come.\"\n\nOn Monday, his first day back at school since the disaster, Muhriz was putting on a brave face. \"I'm just fine,\" he said, welcoming his visitors with a toothy, childish grin.\n\n\"I'm tired,\" he went on, hurling his backpack onto the sitting room carpet and sinking into the sofa. \"I'm fasting.\"\n\nRelatives said the boy's grief came in waves.\n\n\"At first he was shocked. He cried several times. He couldn't believe the news that his mother had passed away,\" said his uncle, who has been driving his nephew to school while Mohamed Afindi, the boy's father, seeks information on the whereabouts of his wife's body.\n\n\"Right now, we are here to look after him. But at night we don't know how he is.\"\n\nMuhriz's greatest desire was to see his mother's body returned to Malaysia.\n\nRelatives hope to bury her alongside her mother and sister at the Paroi Muslim Cemetery near their suburban family home in Seremban, a town around 35 miles from Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\"The rebels should show some humanity. Why are the rebels doing all this? It was not an army or fighters on the aircraft,\" Mr Jaafar said.\n\n\"They are pro-Russia, right? So why doesn't Putin just tell them to stop? Putin has the power, doesn't he? It would solve it.\"\n\nMuhriz's father said he wanted to travel to Kiev to find and recover his dead wife. The Malaysian government has said it hopes to fly four people from each victim's family there.\n\nAsked how he was coping, Mr Afindi broke down: \"Only God knows. I'm speechless. I don't know what to say.\"\n\nIn the cabinet behind him a portrait of his wife had been placed beside five miniature Malaysia Airlines planes, photographs of her son as a toddler, and a poem.\n\n\"Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too love for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice,\" it read. \"But for those who love, time is eternity.\"\n\n--The Telegraph\n\nMH17: Ukrainians Share Pain At Malaysian Embassy\n\nKIEV: The Malaysian embassy here has been receiving a steady stream of visitors since Thursday.\n\nSome left tributes to the souls lost in the MH17 tragedy.\n\nScores of bouquets line one wall outside the embassy, as do teddy bears, other stuffed toys and messages and religious iconography.\n\nMost of the messages were in the local language, making it no less poignant, but driving home the point that Ukrainians in general feel the pain of the families who have lost loved ones.\n\nThe more \"important\" visitors place their tributes, then enter the embassy to sign a condolence book and speak with Malaysian ambassador to Ukraine Chuah Teong Ban or one of his representatives, a regular occurrence considering Chuah is a busy man these days.\n\nEmbassy staff say tears are a regular sight among well-wishers, another fact that proves the sincerity of the regular Ukrainian, and in fact the world.\n\nAnd why not? The MH17 tragedy does not belong to Malaysia alone. It does not belong merely to the countries whose citizens were aboard the aircraft.\n\nIt is a tragedy that affects the entire world.\n\n--New Straits Times\n\nMH17: Rescuers Find 251 Bodies At Crash Site\n\nKIEV: Rescuers found 251 bodies and 86 fragments of bodies by late on Sunday at the crash site of a Malaysian airliner and a second train with refrigerator wagons to take the remains away has arrived, a Ukrainian government committee said.\n\nIn a statement, the committee investigating the disaster said the first train where the remains of almost 200 victims have been placed before starting their journey home was stuck in the station in the town of Torez because “terrorists are blocking its exit.”\n\n--REUTERS\n\n‘Colleagues’ Unite\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: FLIGHT attendants worldwide have come together in the Facebook page “A Fly Guy’s Cabin Crew Lounge”, flooding it with messages to the crew of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.\n\nThe page, which was initially started for flight attendants to connect and share their stories and photographs, has turned into an avenue for condolences and sympathies for the MH17 crew, who died in a crash in Ukraine on Thursday.\n\nA post titled “Letters of Love to Malaysia Airlines”, uploaded 151 photos containing letters of love and support made by airline employees all over the world.\n\nThe album came with a post: “Over the past few days, airliners around the world have taken to the sky with heavy hearts. An air disaster doesn’t affect just one airline; it takes a part of all our spirits down with it. We are united by wings and airline staff around the world want our family at Malaysia Airlines to know we are standing behind them.”\n\nWestJet flight attendant Robin Feldberg said: “From this, rest in peace MH17 crew and passengers. My heart hurts today. And yes, we may all wear different uniforms but, we are one big family in the sky. I feel like members of my family have been taken too soon.”\n\nQatar Airways crew member Jose Refaei offered his condolences and said the tragedy could happen to anyone.\n\n“I’m sure losing crew or family member isn’t too easy to deal with. I’m truly feeling extremely sad for that accident.”\n\nUnited States’ Southwest Airlines crew member Darsie Barker Chase posted: “Many of us started this job when we were young and it’s what we know.\n\n“Many of us thought it would be a fun way to see the world and quickly found out that we didn’t just get a job, we got a family.\n\n“When something happens to one of us, no matter the carrier, it hurts, but to find out that someone did it on purpose, that pain and fear is indescribable. It’s like someone did it to your sibling. God bless you Malaysia.”\n\nPatricia Mari Tapalla Buloron of Cebu Pacific Air said flight attendants’ hearts all over the world were in deep pain for what happened to MH370 and MH17.\n\n“Our prayers and sympathy indeed won’t be divided by what uniforms we wear. Safe flights, everyone.”\n\nMany crew also shared their jitters of flying after the incident.\n\nCabin crew member Evelyn Greter said she landed in Amsterdam with a heavy heart.\n\n“It breaks my heart to think I may have made eye contact in passing or smiled at their relatives in the departure hall as they said their goodbyes.”\n\nDutch flight attendant Dounia Haddoudi said flying would now be very hard.\n\n“A lot of Dutch people knew a few of the passengers of flight MH17. So, it won’t be just hard for us flight attendants but also for passengers flying today. May you all have a save flight!”\n\nAnother Dutch crew member, Nicolien Bom, said it was difficult to sleep after hearing about MH17.\n\n“This morning, I learned that almost 200 people of my country, the Netherlands, had died in the crash.\n\n“It made me very sad and I nearly cried on my way to work.”\n\nCabin crew member, Jessica Elyse, said a colleague had rung her family after the tragedy in tears just to tell them that she loved them, “in case something happens, because nothing about flying feels safe anymore”.\n\nCabin crew member Petra Petrush said he flew the night after MH17 was downed and it was difficult for him.\n\n“I was not scared but I felt deeply saddened by this tragedy for our colleagues, passengers and their families.

The truth is my family lost a woman who was a wife, mother, grandmother, sister and cousin to many of us. Why blame MAS? The entire world is not blaming MAS and you call yourself a Malaysian MP.\n\n“The truth is our loved one is gone and here you are playing politics.\n\n“This is not the time and place for you to dwell into MAS for your political gimmick.\n\n“This is now the time for us, the families, and you, the leaders, to fight for us so that we get the remains and whatever belongings are left as a form of comfort,” the relative wrote in response to Nga’s posting in Twitter and Facebook.\n\nIn his posting “Can Malaysia Airlines explain this?” with a clipping, dated July 18, the MP questioned why MAS was still flying over the Ukranian airspace when Australian and Korean airlines had shifted their flight routes months earlier.\n\nWhen contacted, Nga said his thoughts and prayers were with the passengers and crew of MH17, and that at a time of crisis, he fully supported the government to demand justice for the victims.\n\n“On my tweet... there is nothing more and nothing less, except for MAS to explain when the United States Federal Aviation Department had issued a directive in April prohibiting all US airlines to use that airspace.\n\n“I do not wish to blame anyone. However, it is also a time for reflection for all airlines. The key point is passengers’ safety is important.”\n\nMeanwhile, Tan has since apologised over her posting in Mandarin, “Malaysia is so scary... what kind of a useless country is this?”\n\nThe posting was put up following the downing of MH17 last Thursday, and has since gone viral, leaving many netizens fuming.\n\nTan, who lists her profession as a real estate and property negotiator, has since made a subsequent posting to make amends.\n\nLast Friday, she wrote: “I would like to apologise over my personal statement describing Malaysia following the unfortunate incident of MH17.\n\n“It is not my intention to hurt the feeling of Malaysians... Sorry! Let’s pray for MH17!”.\n\nHowever, Tan’s attempt at apology did little in damage control as it had incensed the people more.\n\nAmong the criticisms posted on Facebook are: “If you want to criticise the country, please renounce your citizenship first... don’t slap yourself.”\n\nThe same person then went on to mock Tan by stating: “Oh... sorry for my harsh words...”\n\nAnother Facebook user, Sze Tho Weng Ho, posted: “For goodness’ sake, please use your brain before you speak.\n\n“The whole country is mourning.

That is the most important thing we need to do.”\n\nHamzah said the government would be working closely with all relevant parties to determine the cause of the tragedy and reiterated that all information that the government has must be corroborated and verified beforehand.\n\n“The information that we have currently must be verified, I cannot say that it will be easy, but our team is already in Kiev.\n\n“The distance between Kiev and the crash site is more than 500km and it will not be easy in getting there,” he said, adding that there were no plans to send the families to Ukraine.\n\nAn elderly family member, who declined to be named, said she accepted what had happened as fate.\n\n“The prime minister has promised us that he will try to bring back the remains of our loved ones.

the crisis-ridden eastern Ukraine region.\n\nIn messages posted after Transport Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai concluded a news conference on updates to the fatal incident, Khairy accused the international media of trying to put the burden of responsibility on its choice of flight path.\n\n“It’s not the route selection that resulted in these deaths. It’s some terrorist deciding to shoot our plane that caused these deaths. #MH17,” he wrote on the micro-blogging site.\n\nKhairy stressed that blaming MAS over its route selection is unacceptable as many other commercial planes cover the same route, which had been approved by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).\n\nHe even posted a graphic in reply to a tweet that criticised MAS’ decision to fly over eastern Ukraine airspace, which showed at least three other carriers — KLM, Lufthansa and Thai Airways — using similar flight paths to get to destinations in Southeast Asia.\n\n“If we don’t fight this narrative with facts, this will define the international news cycle. Malaysia an easy scapegoat. Not on. #MH17,” Khairy said.\n\nEarlier at the news conference, Liow denied talk that flight MH17 had taken a shorter route over eastern Ukraine to save money and fuel.\n\nLiow also repeatedly stressed that the route taken by the commercial jetliner, which was shot down yesterday in the region controlled by pro-Russia separatists, was a safe flight path approved by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).\n\n“Since it’s an approved route, it’s safe,” Liow told a press conference here today.\n\n“I want to stress that the route was an approved path flown for decades by Malaysia Airlines and other aircraft,” he added.\n\nThe minister also noted that 15 out of 16 airlines in the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines fly the same route over Ukraine.\n\nAll the 298 people aboard flight MH17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur are believed dead following the Boeing 777-200’s crash near a Ukrainian village yesterday, following reports that it was struck out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine have denied shooting down the commercial jet.\n\nAccording to international news wire Reuters, Ukraine has since closed the airspace over its eastern regions where it is battling pro-Russia rebels.\n\nOut of the 283 passengers and 15 crew aboard the doomed plane, there were 44 Malaysians, while the Dutch comprised the majority at 173 people.\n\n- The Malay Mail\n\nGrim Trawl For Bodies At Mh17 Crash Site\n\nGRABOVE: A guidebook on Bali and a children’s card game lie amid the debris of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 as emergency workers pick through the grisly carnage of the vast crash site, recovering corpse after corpse.\n\nPainstakingly, fire fighters make their way through the wreckage, stopping here and there to plant sticks tied with white rags to identify the location of some of the 298 victims.\n\n“Anatoly, come over here. There are a lot more in this field,” a fireman shouts to his colleague as a light rain falls.\n\nA day after the passenger jet was apparently shot down by a missile in rebel-held eastern Ukraine, dozens of fire trucks from surrounding towns were at the scene.\n\nBut with the debris scattered for kilometres, under-equipped emergency crews were clearly overwhelmed by the scale of the tragedy.\n\nHours after the disaster, an AFP crew at the site saw dozens of severely mutilated corpses still lying at the crash site after eyewitnesses reported seeing the plane disintegrate in mid-air.\n\nAn arm could be seen poking from under a seat lying in a ditch. Nearby, luggage was piled up on a slope.\n\nTwo engines, a piece of a landing gear and chunks of the fuselage dotted with windows were strewn about as melted metal solidified in pools.\n\nThe sound of dogs barking could be heard in the distance. Separatist fighters at the site said they will shoot any animals that come to scavenge there.\n\nKiev has blamed the rebels and their alleged Russian backers for downing the plane. But the separatist deny the claim and have vowed to protect the scene and allow investigators access to the crash site.\n\nThe smell of death\n\nThe rebels have also suggested that they are willing to agree to a temporary truce to facilitate the recovery but the sound of faraway explosions can still be heard sporadically.\n\nAlong a country road, a mini-bus has been converted into a crisis unit with 18 miners from a nearby pit serving as volunteers.\n\n“Of course, it’s scary but we can’t leave them like that,” says Ivan, 54, a miner of 28 years, referring to the victims.\n\nIn the background the noise of a volley of Grad multiple rocket launcher is heard.\n\n“Hear that, there they are again bombing the peaceful population” he says.\n\nThere are no crowds of curious onlookers at the scene and the inhabitants of a nearby hamlet remain indoors trying to make sense of the carnage that they’ve witnessed.\n\n“You understand, it was as if a three-storey building came down but missed us,” Pavel, 45, a farmer told AFP as he looked at some of the fuselage lying a hundred metres from his house.\n\n“I’m in shock and will never forget it. We really almost died. It smells like death.” Another crew of emergency workers walks past carrying a fresh bundle of sticks to use as markers.\n\nOne of them lets slip it is unlikely that all of the victims can be recovered.\n\n“We realise that we’ll never find all of them in an area of 25 square kilometres,” he says.\n\n— AFP\n\nMH17: PM Offers Prayers For Victims, Family Members\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak said he had prayed for the passengers and crew on board the Malaysia Airlines aircraft, which had gone down in the eastern Ukraine, during Friday prayers today.\n\nIn his Twitter account, the prime minister said he had also extended his prayers for the next-of-kin.\n\n“During Friday prayers, I had prayed for the passengers and crew of MH17 as well as their family members.\n\n“This is a very difficult period for all of us,” he said.\n\nThere were 283 passengers and 15 crews on-board the ill-fated Boeing 777-200 aircraft.\n\n- NST\n\nMH17: Selangor Govt Offer Condolences So\n\nSHAH ALAM: The Selangor state government today expressed condolences to family members of MH17 crew and passengers who perished after the jetliner was shot down in Ukraine on Thursday night.\n\n\"The state government and citizens of Selangor convey our condolences to all family members of those onboard MH17 from Malaysia, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and several other countries who lost their loved ones in the MH17 aircraft accident which crashed at the Ukraine-Russia border.\n\n\"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for all Malaysians and the world community especially when we are still mourning the loss of MH370,\" said Menteri Besar Tan Sri Abdul Khalid Ibrahim in a statement yesterday.\n\nAbdul Khalid urged Malaysians to remain calm, courageous and strong in facing the tragedy.\n\n\"For Muslims, this incident happened in the holy month of Ramadan, teaches us to be patient and accept what has happened with an open heart.\n\n\"We pray that this tragedy does not dampen the spirit of Malaysian Airline System (MAS) crew to continue providing excellent service to preserve MAS' good name internationally.\n\n\"We also hope the Malaysian government will send a strong message to the international community so that the parties responsible for this tragedy will be punished for this inhumane action,\" he said.\n\n- NST\n\nMH17: Wife Waiting To Hear From Husband\n\nKUCHING : An oil and gas scaffolder from Bintulu is believed to be among the passengers on board MH17.\n\nThe wife of 48-year old Meling Mula, Sigut Kedit, 39 said her husband was expected to be home today after working in Venezuela for the past two months.\n\n\"My brother told me about the incident and I am bracing myself for the worst,\" said Sigut when contacted.\n\nSigut also said she has yet to receive any official news from Malaysia Airlines but her brother has been in contact with them.\n\nMeling who is working as a scaffolder with Saiten Sdn Bhd in Venezuela told his wife about his trip home on Wednesday and promised her that he will spend family time with them.\n\n\"I have been waiting for his return since the day he called but this is just surreal,\" she added.\n\nMeling and his wife has three children, namely Maryline Sindu, 18, Benedict Bana, 15 and Gabriel 8.\n\n- NST\n\nMH17: Condolences From Media Prima\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: Media Prima Berhad Group has expressed sadness over the Malaysia Airlines (MAS) flight MH17 tragedy which saw the deaths of 298 passengers and crew on board.\n\n“The board of directors, management and employees of Media Prima Berhad wish to convey our profound condolences to the families of the crew and passengers of MH17.\n\n“Our thoughts and prayers are with them and as Malaysians we stand united in grief.\n\n“Although our sympathies cannot begin to heal their bereavement, we pray that they are granted the patience and fortitude to endure this extremely difficult period.”\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement (ABIM) also extended their deepest condolences to all the families of those involved in the MH17 plane crash.\n\nABIM secretary-general Muhammad Faisal Abdul Aziz said prayers are for Malaysia.\n\n“This incident came as a shock to all Malaysians as we have yet to get past the MH370 aircraft disappearance.\n\n“We hope the authorities will be able to give the attention this incident deserves and the welfare of the next-of-kin are well taken care of.\n\n“We also seek the government’s cooperation to convey all the latest information regarding the crash as soon as possible through the social media or other means of communication.”\n\nOn Thursday, MAS Boeing 777 jetliner crashed in Ukraine near the Russion border, believed to have been shot down, killing 43 Malaysian nationals along with it.\n\n- NST\n\nMH17: US Ambassador Offer Condolences\n\nKUALA LUMPUR: US ambassador Joseph Y.

            "text": "US Intelligence has confirmed that a surface-to-air missile shot down a Malaysian Airlines plane, flight MH17, en route from Amsterdam. Pictures of the wreckage have now appeared, yet no one has a clear idea of who fired the missile. Here are the three most prominent explanations:\n\nPro-Russian Ukrainian separatists\n\nIn the past month separatists have shot down a number of Ukrainian military aircraft. On Sunday, separatists used rocket launchers to bring down a Ukrainian Air Force Il-76MD military transport plane. But planes have all been flying lower than a commercial aircraft would have been – the range is about 10,000 feet, and the Malaysian aircraft was flying at about 30,000 feet. Airlines have been aware of the risk in Eastern Ukraine, and were all operating on the assurances of Ukraine’s government that they’d be safe at that height.\n\nUkraine’s president, Petro Poroshenko, has said:\n\nAnton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s Interior Ministry, has told the Wall St Journal that it was pro-Russian separatists:-\n\nBut with what? To hit an aircraft flying so high requires a more advanced radar-guided missile, and there has so far been no indication that the rebels have such a thing. Andrei Purgin, deputy prime minister of the so-called ‘Doinetsk People’s Republic’, has made this point: “We don’t have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height”.\n\nBut then again, as David wrote earlier: ‘BBC Monitoring says that, moments before news of this incident was reported, some separatists claimed that they had downed a Ukrainian plane. Several websites (see here and here) appear to confirm this account.’\n\nThe Ukrainian government, mistaking it for a Russian aircraft\n\nIn a statement, the Ukrainian government has said:\n\nIt would not be the first time Ukrainian forces have shot down a civil aircraft. In 2001, Siberia Airlines Flight 1812 was accidentally shot down by an errant missile from the Ukrainian military when it was on an exercise, killing 78 people.\n\nRussian missiles\n\nThe official Ukrainian line seems to be that Moscow is to blame. Earlier today, it blamed the Russian air force for shooting down a Ukrainian fighter. In its statement, Ukraine’s government says its military has no long-range missiles in the area, and went on to say:\n\nAn Ukraine Interior Ministry adviser has claimed that the weapon was a Russian-made Buk antiaircraft system.\n\nPresident Putin rang President Obama today to discuss the incident. The telephone call was allegedly made at the request of Moscow. The US and European states have just imposed new sanctions on Russia over its aggression in the Ukraine. These sanctions include financial penalties against the oil producer Rosneft, and other Russian companies.",

joe biden said bluntly that the aircraft with 298 people on board was blown out of the sky and the white house late thursday issued a statement linking the crash to a crisis fueled by russian support

europeans refused to adopt similar measures out of fear of jeopardizing their own economic ties the obama administration already has additional sanctions prepared that could be put into effect quickly if obama so chooses the question is does this finally move the europeans across that threshold said a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity to speak more candidly i dont know but

Ukraine said a passenger plane carrying 295 people was shot down Thursday as it flew over the country, and both the government and the pro-Russia separatists fighting in the region denied any responsibility for downing the plane.\n\nPublished Jul 18, 2014 at 12:01AM\n\nDiplomatic aftermath — The downing of a commercial Boeing 777 in the Ukrainian war zone Thursday inflamed an already volatile international crisis and may bolster President Barack Obama’s efforts to isolate Russia if evidence points to complicity by Moscow’s separatist allies. Obama was careful not to offer any judgments in his only public comments on the crash. But Vice President Joe Biden said bluntly that the aircraft with 298 people on board was “blown out of the sky,” and the White House late Thursday issued a statement linking the crash to a crisis “fueled by Russian support for the separatists.” If investigators are able to confirm suspicions that the Malaysia Airlines jet was brought down by a surface-to-air missile fired by pro-Russian rebels who mistook it for a military aircraft, U.S. officials expressed hope that the tragedy will underscore their case that Moscow has been violating Ukrainian sovereignty. While Obama had imposed new sanctions on Russia just a day before, Europeans refused to adopt similar measures out of fear of jeopardizing their own economic ties. The Obama administration already has additional sanctions prepared that could be put into effect quickly if Obama so chooses. “The question is does this finally move the Europeans across that threshold,” said a senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity to speak more candidly. “I don’t know, but how could it not?” European officials were cautious in their initial reactions, seeking time and information before jumping to possible consequences, and were reluctant to assign blame. But most of the slain passengers were Europeans. The majority of them, 154 in all, were from the Netherlands, where the flight originated, which could increase pressure on European governments to respond. The presidents of the European Council and European Commission, which are central governing bodies for the continental union, called for “an immediate and thorough investigation” to establish responsibility “as quickly as possible.” — New York Times News Service\n\nGRABOVO, Ukraine — A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 with 298 people aboard exploded, crashed and burned on a flowered wheat field Thursday in a part of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russia separatists, blown out of the sky at 33,000 feet by what Ukrainian and U.S. officials described as a Russian-made anti-aircraft missile.\n\nUkraine accused the separatists of carrying out what it called a terrorist attack.\n\nU.S. intelligence and military officials said the plane had been destroyed by a Russian SA-series missile, based on surveillance satellite data that showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not its point of origin.\n\nThere were strong indications that those responsible may have errantly downed what they had thought was a military aircraft only to discover, to their presumed shock, that they had struck a civilian airliner.

charged there is no limit to the cynicism of putin and his terrorists he said europe canada the usa the civilized world — open your eyes help us with everything you can he pleaded herashenko said video from the site shows that some jerks were shouting look how wonderful it is burning beautiful for their part leaders of the separatists selfproclaimed donetsk peoples republic denied any involvement in bringing down the airliner the plane was shot down by the ukrainian side said serhiy kavtaradze a member of the rebels security council according to the russias interfax news agency we simply do not have such air defense systems he said rebels shoulderlaunched antimissile weapons have a firing range of only 3000 to 4000 meters and that passenger jets fly at a much higher altitude as is always the case with breaking news stories like this its worth keeping in mind that initial reports are often incomplete and untrue additionally the claims from ukrainians should at least initially be taken with a grain of salt given the conflict going on in the region and the fact that it would be in their interests to pin responsibility for what happened here on either the russians or on prorussian separatists we may learn that the plane experienced engine trouble of some kind or some other kind of mechanical trouble that caused it to drop from the sky in this manner although its worth noting that at the moment at least there are no reports that crew was making any indication of such trouble other possible causes of what could have happened of course would include a bomb on the plane or terrorist hijacking but that takes us into realms of speculation that its not really a good idea to get into without further evidence all that being said there certainly does seem to be some evidence for the ukrainian claim that the plane was shot down radar date tracked by flight aware shows the plane disappearing from radar with no indication of a rapid loss in altitude for example additionally there has been a decided uptick in tensions in eastern ukraine and along the ukrainianrussian border over the past week or so including just on monday a ukrainian transport plane that was allegedly shot down by some means from the russian side of the border cnn meanwhile is reporting that one representative of the separatists was making claims that his group had shot down a ukrainian plane about an hour prior to the news of the crash becoming public the veracity of that claim though seems difficult to accept given the fact that by all accounts the separatists do not have the type of weaponry that would be needed to shoot down a plane flying at 33000 feet if the plane was indeed shot down then it obviously raises memories of korean airlines flight 007 which was shot down by soviet fighters after it had strayed from its intended flight plan from new york city to soeul accidentally straying close to the soviet base at sakalin island in that case the soviets claimed that the plane had been shot down in error due to perceived threats although few people outside the ussr believed that the pilots could have not known that the plane they were tracking was a passenger airliner in this case it also should have been very easy for military radar to figure out that flight 17 was not a military plane due both to its radar signature assuming that its transponder was working properly and the fact that it was flying at an altitude typically used by commercial airliners at the same time though it seems inconceivable that this would have been a deliberate action either by the russians or by the separatists mistake or not though it doesnt take much to realize that this could end up being a very serious incident if it does indeed turn out that the plane was shot down for that reason alone its essential that we let the facts play out at their own pace and avoid the kind of speculation that could lead to unnecessarily increased tensions this post will be updated as necessary or well cover other aspects of this news in new posts as warranted update reuters is reporting that there were american citizens on the plane breaking number of dead from crash of mh17 more than 300 includes 23 us citizen interior ministry adviser quoted by interfax — reuters top news reuters july 17 2014 the united states was likely to be involved in any investigation of this crash in any case but this guarantees that we will be doing so i would think update us intelligence sources are reporting that malaysia airlines flight 17 was brought down by a surface to air

            "text": "A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 filing from Amsterdam to Kuala Lampur has crashed somewhere in eastern Ukraine, and some allegations are being raised that the plane may have been shot down:\n\nMOSCOW — A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 with nearly 300 people aboard crashed in eastern Ukraine near the Russian border on Thursday, the Ukraine government and a regional European aviation official reported, and the Interfax news agency said it had been shot down. Ukraine’s president, Petro O. Poroshenko, said in a statement that he was calling for an immediate investigation of the crash. He did not rule out that it might have been shot down. A regional airline official said the plane had been flying at about 33,000 feet when radar trackers lost it over eastern Ukraine near the Russian border. Eastern Ukraine has been roiled for months by a violent pro-Russian separatist uprising in which a number of military aircraft have been downed. But this would be the first commercial airline disaster resulting from the hostilities in Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines, still reeling from the mysterious loss of another Boeing 777 flight in March, said it had lost contact with the flight, MH17, from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur over Ukraine but offered no further details immediately. Malaysia’s president, Mohd Najib Tun Razak, said in a Twitter post that he was “shocked by reports that an MH plane crashed. We are launching an immediate investigation.” Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia’s defense minister, responded to reports that the aircraft had disappeared and might have been shot down by posting a series of terse messages on Twitter: “Monitoring this closely,” said one. In another, he referred to the Ministry of Defense in saying that, “I have directed MINDEF to get confirmation.” Andrei Purgin, deputy prime minister of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the insurgent group in eastern Ukraine, denied in a telephone interview that the rebels had anything to do with the downing of the passenger jet. He said the rebels had shot down Ukrainian planes before but that their anti-aircraft weapons could only reach to around 4,000 meters, far below the level of passenger jets. “We don’t have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height,” he said. He said the plane apparently came down in an area of Ukrainian military operations and that it was not out of the question that Ukrainians themselves shot it down.\n\nFurther details from NBC News:\n\nMalaysia Airlines jet with 295 people on board crashed in Ukraine near the Russian border on Thursday, according to the Interfax news agency, and an adviser to the Ukrainian government said that it had been shot down. The reports could not immediately be confirmed by NBC News, but Malaysia Airlines said on its Twitter account that it had lost contact with an aircraft, Flight 17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. A Reuters correspondent in eastern Ukraine reported seeing the burning wreckage of a plane and bodies on the ground. More than four months ago, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, disappeared in the greatest mystery in modern aviation. Multi-nation searches of swaths of land and ocean have turned up no sign of that aircraft. A adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry said that Flight 17, a Boeing 777, had been shot down over a town in the east of the country, The Associated Press reported. Pro-Russian separatists have been fighting Ukrainian security forces in that region for months. The adviser, Anton Gerashenko, said on his Facebook page that the plane was flying at 33,000 feet when it was hit by a missile fired from a launcher known as a Buk. A similar launcher was seen by Associated Press journalists near the eastern Ukrainian town of Snizhne earlier Thursday. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Twitter: “I am shocked by reports that an MH plane crashed. We are launching an immediate investigation.” The Malaysian defense minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said that there was no confirmation that the plane had been shot down. He said on Twitter that the Malaysian military had been instructed to “get on it.” President Barack Obama was briefed and directed his team to be in close touch with senior Ukrainian officials, press secretary Josh Earnest said. Officials at the Pentagon scrambled to learn more and assess who might have had the capability to shoot down an airliner.\n\nAnd The Washington Post:\n\nMalaysia Airlines said Thursday that it lost contact with an airliner that was flying in Ukrainian airspace, raising fears that the plane may have been shot down over eastern Ukraine. “We lost contact with Flight MH17 in Ukraine,” said Najmuddin Abdullah, who works in Malaysia Airlines’ press office. An adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister wrote on Facebook that a Buk antiaircraft missile system shot down the plane over the village of Torez, about 25 miles east of the city of Donetsk and within territory held by pro-Russian separatist rebels. The plane was carrying 280 passengers and 15 crew members, Anton Herashenko, the Interior Ministry adviser, wrote on his Facebook page, without revealing how he knew the information. He blamed the rebels for the attack. Herashenko said on Facebook that “local patriots” reported the movement of the Buk missile system Thursday morning from Torez in the direction of Sneznoye. He said the Malaysian plane en route to Kuala Lumpur was flying at 10,000 meters. The missile system was “generously provided” to the rebels by Russian President Vladi­mir Putin, Herashenko charged. “There is no limit to the cynicism of Putin and his terrorists!” he said. “Europe, Canada, the USA, the civilized world — open your eyes! Help us with everything you can!” he pleaded. Herashenko said video from the site shows that “some jerks were shouting: Look, how wonderful it is burning! Beautiful!” For their part, leaders of the separatists’ self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic denied any involvement in bringing down the airliner. “The plane was shot down by the Ukrainian side,” said Serhiy Kavtaradze, a member of the rebels’ security council, according to the Russia’s Interfax news agency. “We simply do not have such air defense systems.” He said rebels’ shoulder-launched antimissile weapons “have a firing range of only 3,000 to 4,000 meters” and that passenger jets fly at a much higher altitude.\n\nAs is always the case with breaking news stories like this, it’s worth keeping in mind that initial reports are often incomplete and untrue. Additionally, the claims from Ukrainians should at least initially be taken with a grain of salt given the conflict going on in the region and the fact that it would be in their interests to pin responsibility for what happened here on either the Russians or on pro-Russian separatists. We may learn that the plane experienced engine trouble of some kind or some other kind of mechanical trouble that caused it to drop from the sky in this manner, although its worth noting that at the moment at least there are no reports that crew was making any indication of such trouble. Other possible causes of what could have happened, of course, would include a bomb on the plane or terrorist hijacking, but that takes us into realms of speculation that its not really a good idea to get into without further evidence.\n\nAll that being said, there certainly does seem to be some evidence for the Ukrainian claim that the plane was shot down. Radar date tracked by Flight Aware shows the plane disappearing from radar with no indication of a rapid loss in altitude, for example. Additionally, there has been a decided up-tick in tensions in eastern Ukraine and along the Ukrainian-Russian border over the past week or so including, just on Monday, a Ukrainian transport plane that was allegedly shot down by some means from the Russian side of the border. CNN, meanwhile, is reporting that one representative of the separatists was making claims that his group had shot down a Ukrainian plane about an hour prior to the news of the crash becoming public. The veracity of that claim, though, seems difficult to accept given the fact that, by all accounts, the separatists do not have the type of weaponry that would be needed to shoot down a plane flying at 33,000 feet.\n\nIf the plane was indeed shot down, then it obviously raises memories of Korean Airlines Flight 007, which was shot down by Soviet fighters after it had strayed from its intended flight plan from New York City to Soeul, accidentally straying close to the Soviet base at Sakalin Island. In that case, the Soviets claimed that the plane had been shot down in error due to perceived threats, although few people outside the USSR believed that the pilots could have not known that the plane they were tracking was a passenger airliner. In this case, it also should have been very easy for military radar to figure out that Flight 17 was not a military plane due both to its radar signature (assuming that its transponder was working properly) and the fact that it was flying at an altitude typically used by commercial airliners. At the same time, though, it seems inconceivable that this would have been a deliberate action, either by the Russians or by the separatists.\n\nMistake or not, though, it doesn’t take much to realize that this could end up being a very serious incident if it does indeed turn out that the plane was shot down.  For that reason alone, it’s essential that we let the facts play out at their own pace and avoid the kind of speculation that could lead to unnecessarily increased tensions.\n\nThis post will be updated as necessary, or we’ll cover other aspects of this news in new posts as warranted.\n\nUpdate: Reuters is reporting that there were American citizens on the plane:\n\nThe United States was likely to be involved in any investigation of this crash in any case, but this guarantees that we will be doing so I would think.\n\nUpdate: U.S Intelligence sources are reporting that Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was brought down by a surface to air missile.",

corpses littered among wreckage that was still smoldering late into the summer night russias president vladimir v putin blamed ukraines government for creating the conditions for the insurgency in eastern ukraine where separatists have bragged about shooting down at least three ukrainian military aircraft but putin did not specifically deny that a russianmade weapon had felled the malaysian jetliner whatever the cause the news of the crashed plane with a passenger manifest that spanned at least nine countries elevated the insurgency into a new international crisis the day before the

            "text": "HRABOVE , Ukraine — A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 with 298 people aboard exploded, crashed, and burned on a flowered wheat field Thursday in a part of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russia separatists, blown out of the sky at 33,000 feet by what Ukrainian and US officials described as a \n\nRussian-made antiaircraft missile.\n\nUkraine accused the separatists of carrying out what it called a terrorist attack.\n\nContinue reading below\n\nUS intelligence and military officials said the plane had been destroyed by a Russian SA-series missile, based on surveillance satellite data that showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not its point of origin.\n\nThere were strong indications that those responsible may have errantly downed what they had thought was a military aircraft only to discover, to their shock, that they had struck a \n\ncivilian airliner. Everyone aboard was killed, their corpses littered among wreckage that was still smoldering late into the summer night.\n\nRussia’s president, Vladimir V. \n\nPutin, blamed Ukraine’s government for creating the conditions for the insurgency in eastern Ukraine, where separatists have bragged about shooting down at least three Ukrainian military aircraft. But Putin did not specifically deny that a Russian-made weapon had felled the Malaysian jetliner.\n\nWhatever the cause, the news of the crashed plane, with a passenger manifest that spanned at least nine countries, elevated the insurgency into a new international crisis. The day before, the United States had slapped new sanctions on Russia for its support of the pro-Kremlin insurgency that has brought East-West relations to their lowest point in many years.\n\nMaking the crash even more of a shock, it was the second time within months that Malaysia Airlines had suffered a mass-casualty flight disaster with international intrigue — and with the same model plane, a Boeing 777-200ER.\n\nContinue reading below\n\nPrime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia — whose government is still reeling from the unexplained disappearance of Flight 370 in March over the Indian Ocean — said he was stupefied at the news of Flight 17, which had been bound for Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam with 283 passengers, including three infants, and 15 crew members aboard.\n\nSeveral passengers on board a the jetliner were world-renowned researchers heading to an international AIDS conference in Australia, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAviation officials said the aircraft had been traveling an approved and heavily trafficked route over eastern Ukraine, about 20 miles from the Russia border, when it vanished from radar screens at 2:15 p.m. local time, with no distress signal.\n\n“This is a tragic day in what has already been a tragic year for Malaysia,” Najib said. “If it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice.”\n\nNajib said he had spoken with the leaders of Ukraine and the Netherlands, who promised their cooperation. He also said that he had spoken with President Obama, and that “he and I both agreed that the investigation must not be hindered in any way.” The remark pointed to concerns about evidence tampering at the crash site.\n\nObama and Putin also spoke about the disaster and the broader Ukraine crisis, White House officials said, and Putin expressed his condolences to Malaysia. But in a statement quoted by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency, Putin said, “This tragedy would not have happened if there was peace in the country, if military operations had not resumed in the southeast of Ukraine.”\n\nThe United Nations Security Council scheduled a meeting on the crisis for Friday morning.\n\nAdding to Ukrainian and Western suspicions that separatists were culpable, Ukraine’s intelligence agency, the State Security Service, known as the SBU, released what it said was audio from intercepted phone calls between separatist rebels and Russian military intelligence officers on Thursday.

Many of those closed because of the requirement that doctors at those clinics obtain hospital admitting privileges within a certain radius of the clinic, and many doctors couldn’t comply. That requirement began November 1. This week marks the one-year anniversary of the law that started it all.

The South Texas site — which is at Boca Chica, a remote beach surrounded by wildlife areas about 20 miles east of Brownsville — has been competing with sites in Florida and Georgia for the launch facility.

In the 1970s, Texas redistricting litigation helped end the use of at-large districts to select legislators. Twenty years later, a Texas case led to rulings defining standards for measuring when legislators had gone too far in drawing districts to protect the power of minority groups. And in Tom DeLay’s infamous twice-in-one decade redistricting cycle of the 2000s, the Supreme Court got the chance to consider whether the process amounted to a partisan gerrymander.\n\nclick here for more\n\nThe saying “every drop counts” seems be more and more true in West Texas.

That same consensus also holds that if the GOP does indeed take control, the next two years will be marked by confrontation with the White House and even less actual legislative action than the present Congress has accomplished. To be fair, there is some compelling logic behind these conclusions. President Obama has clearly opted out of the role of governing through legislation.

According to the report, the number of uninsured Houston residents could drop by 212,000 people by 2016 - from 744,000 to 531,000 - as a result of Affordable Care Act provisions to extend health insurance coverage to a greater number of people.

Thousands of immigrants cross the 1200 mile Texas border illegally every year. For years, Governor Perry has continually asked the federal government to do something about it. Now, with what some are calling an \" invasion\" of illegal immigrants, Governor Perry said it's time, with or without the federal government's help to take action and prevent this influx from happening over and over again.\n\nclick here for more\n\nNext week, Gov.

But even before Duncan stepped down July 3, it was already clear that, unlike 1996 when he was first elected to represent the largely rural district — also in a special election — there wouldn’t be as many hopefuls running for his seat. Duncan, R-Lubbock, faced six opponents — three Democrats and three Republicans — and in a runoff, he easily defeated former Lubbock Mayor David Langston.\n\nclick here for more\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry minced no words Sunday in how to deal with the influx of thousands of illegal immigrants. \"If the federal government does not do its constitutional duty to secure the border, the state of Texas will do it,\" he said, drawing a standing ovation from about 150 Republicans at a Cerro Gordo County fundraiser on the grounds of the Mason City Municipal Airport. \"We need to secure the border so the people of this country will be safe.

Rick Perry, who appears to be running for president again, and former Vice President Dick Cheney — not to mention Sen. John McCain, New Jersey Gov.

Was it the worst-ever attempt to win the White House? Was it merely as bad as Rudy Giuliani's? Was it a fluke, caused by Perry's ill-timed (but successful) experimental back surgery, leading to voters meeting the guy at his most fatigued and loopy? We may find out; Perry, according to Jennifer Jacobs (and at least two other reporters who followed Perry on the trip), is back in Iowa and impressing voters. The damage done by his 2012 face-plant can be seen in how Jacobs records every verbal slip. \"I know that the greatest and best years are in front of us and I know how to start us back on the track of an America that can be a beacon that's on top of a hill that's bright and that's bringing people into prosperity and hope and freedom.\n\nclick here for more\n\nWe are in the midst of a humanitarian crisis that has left more than 52,000 children, many without their parents, in limbo at America’s borders.

Instead of using the excess revenue to make government bigger, however, legislators should consider limiting state spending growth to keep more dollars in the hands of families. Our low taxes and vibrant economy depend on it. Consider the 2004-15 period.

In these heartbreaking cases, it's difficult to go back and pinpoint how these fragile lives could have been saved. If the state had better programs to help at-risk families, could they have stayed safely with their original parents? If Texas had stronger standards for training and screening foster parents — rather than leaving so much discretion to the private contractors who recruit families — would this foster family have been selected? Would it have known to be more careful around the water?\n\nclick here for more\n\nGoogle has not been kind to Rick Perry. Type in “Rick Perry gaffe” and you get 111,000 results.

Thirty Border Patrol agents were assigned in August 2013 to drive the children to off-site showers, wash their clothes and make them sandwiches. As soon as those children were placed in temporary shelters, more arrived. An average of 66 were apprehended each day on the border and more than 24,000 cycled through Texas patrol stations in 2013.

An administration official said that the number of children in holding facilities along the border within the Rio Grande Valley sector — where the vast majority of children have been stopped — is less than one-quarter of what it was in June.

Now Mexico finds itself whipsawing between compassion and crackdown as it struggles with a migration crisis of its own.

So while the recent debate over banning fracking in the North Texas city of Denton is a confusing sight to our Houston eyes, it is also understandable.

might be regarded in some respects as a rogue state putins choice now is to either cooperate with the united states and others whose nationals have been killed – in one of the more sickening disasters in aviation history – and deescalate the conflict in ukraine or deal with the consequences if there is solid evidence that it is the militants who did it and the weapon originated in russia there will

crash in an interview with the times andrei purgin deputy prime minister of the donetsk peoples republic admitted that insurgents have shot down ukrainian planes recently but he said we dont have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height as for the united states the wall street journal reports that various agencies are divided over whether the missile was launched by the russian military or by prorussia separatist rebels the white house went ahead and criticized russia anyway saying in a statement this incident occurred in the context of a crisis in ukraine that is fueled by russian support for the separatists including through arms material and training while addressing a friday emergency meeting of the united nations security council united states un ambassador samantha power

dont have time for games he continued and while he did not directly blame russia or putin for what happened to flight 17 obama did say that russians actions on behalf of the separatists in ukraine is what allowed the disaster to occur we know that the separatists are heavily armed and they are trained he said that is not an accident that is happening because of russian support it may already be too late to conduct a credible probe rebels have reportedly taken possession of the planes black boxes and ukrainian officials say theyre concerned that theyll be sent to russia and tampered with however on friday rebel leader aleksandr borodai that that his group intended to give the black boxes to the organization for security and cooperation in europe meanwhile the new york times reported that kostyantyn batozsky an adviser to the donetsk regional governor said in a telephone news conference that the aircraft voice and data recording devices had been recovered by ukrainian emergency services workers whom the rebels had granted access to the crash site either way it appears the site has already been thoroughly contaminated as videos show separatist fighters journalists rescue workers and civilians going through the wreckage as for the larger geopolitical consequences its anyones guess obviously the facts arent in yet but feel free to speculate about whether the crash will

The international finger-pointing started almost immediately, and everyone who became an armchair aviation expert during the disappearance of Flight 370 was quick to weigh in. Before we head into the second day of the crisis — which is sure to bring more accusations and unhinged conspiracy theories — here's a guide to what we actually know.\n\nWhat do we know about the plane?\n\nMalaysia Airlines Flight 17 was a Boeing 777-200ER, the same model as Flight 370. Malaysia Airlines tweeted that the plane \"has been in service for 17 years. It had a clean maintenance record.\" It took off at 12:15 p.m on Thursday from Amsterdam and was scheduled to land in Kuala Lumpur at 6:10 a.m. on Friday.\n\nUkrainian authorities notified Malaysia Airlines that they had lost contact with the plane at about 4:21 p.m. local time, when it was about 50 miles from the Ukraine-Russia border, according to the Associated Press. A journalist located the crash site near Hrabove, a village in Ukraine held by pro-Russian separatists about 25 miles from the border.\n\nJohn Wendle, a freelance reporter for ABC News, said there were \"bodies scattered everywhere\" at the crash site. \"There's blood splattered everywhere, and pieces of remains,\" Wendle said. \"It's a pretty grim sight ... This is terrible.\" This New York Times report describes the horrific scene in detail. Many photos and videos of the debris have been posted on social media, and Russian TV ran graphic footage of the wreckage. The video below, which was shot by a local, shows a massive plume of smoke and pieces of the plane falling from the sky:\n\nQuestions arose on Thursday about why Flight 17 was recklessly flying through a war zone. While many airlines have avoided the route recently, about 100 planes were still flying through Ukraine's airspace every day. \"The usual flight route was earlier declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation,\" Malaysia Airlines said in a statement. \"International Air Transportation Association has stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions.\" The jet was cruising at 33,000 feet, which is far beyond the range of the weapons the rebels were thought to possess.\n\nWho was onboard?\n\nIt was initially reported that 280 passengers and 15 crew members were on board, but on Thursday night Malaysia Airlines said three infants were also on the plane, bringing the death toll to 298. The airline released a breakdown of the passengers' nationalities. There were 154 from the Netherlands, 43 from Malaysia (including the crew and two infants), 27 from Australia, 12 from Indonesia (including one infant), 9 from the United Kingdom, 4 from Germany, 4 from Belgium, 3 from the Philippines, and 1 from Canada. The nationalities of 41 victims have not been verified. Malaysia Airlines tweeted:\n\nAdding to the tragedy, it appears that some of the world's leading AIDS researchers lost their lives. The Australian reported that 108 of of the passengers were researchers and their families, who were en route to the 20th International AIDS Conference in Melbourne. There was no source listed for that report, but UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibé said \"many\" of his colleagues were on the flight:\n\nOfficials say Glenn Thomas, a British spokesman for the World Health Organization, and Joep Lange, the former president of the International AIDS Society, were among the victims. \"Joep was a giant in this field; a researcher who really 'got it' in terms of human rights, equity and justice. He was as much activist as researcher — and that is rare. Incredibly sad,\" Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC: Global Advocacy for HIV Prevention, told NBC News.\n\nDuring a Friday morning news briefing, President Obama said that Quinn Lucas Schansman, a man with dual Dutch-United States citizenship, was on the flight. According to a friend, Schansman was born in New York City but spent most of his life in the Netherlands.\n\nHow was the plane shot down?\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies say the plane was hit by a ground-to-air missile, and according to the New York Times, surveillance satellite data suggests it was a Russian SA series missile. The most likely explanation is that whoever shot down the plane thought they were aiming at a military aircraft.\n\nAn adviser to Ukraine's Interior Ministry claimed in a Facebook post that the plane was shot down by separatists using a Russian-made Buk ground-to-air missile system. Associated Press journalists saw rebels in eastern Ukraine with a similar-looking weapon earlier on Thursday. Buk systems could have been provided by the Russians or abandoned by Ukrainian government forces retreating from the area.\n\n\"This is a sophisticated crew-served weapon system,\" John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, told the L.A. Times. \"It’s not like a guy can learn how to shoot one of these in an afternoon. They have entire schools dedicated to teaching people how to operate them.\"\n\nWho fired the missile?\n\nIt's unclear, but the accusations were flying in the hours after the crash. Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Ukraine was ultimately responsible, since, \"This tragedy wouldn't have happened if there had been peace on this territory, if the military actions hadn't been restarted in southeast Ukraine.\"\n\nUkraine described the crash as a terrorist attack carried out by Russian separatists. On Thursday evening, its intelligence agency released edited recordings of intercepted phone calls between rebels and Russian military intelligence officers in which they sound shocked that they shot down a civilian jet. \"We have just shot down a plane,\" says a man believed to be Igor Bezler, a separatist commander. In another call, a man at the scene is asked if he sees any weapons or military equipment. \"Absolutely nothing. Civilian items, medical equipment, towels, toilet paper.\" When asked if he sees any documents, he says, \"Yes, of one Indonesian student.\"\n\nThe rebels are denying that they caused the crash. In an interview with the Times, Andrei Purgin, deputy prime minister of the Donetsk People’s Republic, admitted that insurgents have shot down Ukrainian planes recently, but he said, \"We don’t have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height.\"\n\nAs for the United States, The Wall Street Journal reports that various agencies are \"divided over whether the missile was launched by the Russian military or by pro-Russia separatist rebels.\" The White House went ahead and criticized Russia anyway, saying in a statement, \"This incident occurred in the context of a crisis in Ukraine that is fueled by Russian support for the separatists, including through arms, material and training.\"\n\nWhile addressing a Friday emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, United States U.N. ambassador Samantha Power confirmed that Flight 17 \"was likely downed by a surface-to-air missile, an SA-11, operated from a separatist-held location in eastern Ukraine.\" She added that the United States could not \"rule out technical assistance by Russian personnel\" in operating the weapon.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nLeaders from many nations, including Ukraine and Malaysia, are calling for an international investigation of the crash site. Before an unrelated speech in Delaware, President Obama said the United States is trying to determine if Americans were on the flight, and \"will offer any assistance we can to help determine what happened and why.\"\n\nObama's words were somewhat more forceful on Friday. Calling the crash an \"outrage of unspeakable proportions,\" he vowed to \"make sure the truth is out.\" \"We don't have time for propaganda. We don’t have time for games,\" he continued. And while he did not directly blame Russia or Putin for what happened to Flight 17, Obama did say that Russian's actions on behalf of the separatists in Ukraine is what allowed the disaster to occur. \"We know that [the separatists] are heavily armed and they are trained,\" he said. \"That is not an accident. That is happening because of Russian support.\"\n\nIt may already be too late to conduct a credible probe. Rebels have reportedly taken possession of the plane's black boxes, and Ukrainian officials say they're concerned that they'll be sent to Russia and tampered with. However, on Friday, rebel leader Aleksandr Borodai that that his group intended to give the black boxes to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported that, \"Kostyantyn Batozsky, an adviser to the Donetsk regional governor, said in a telephone news conference that the aircraft voice and data recording devices had been recovered by Ukrainian emergency services workers whom the rebels had granted access to the crash site.\" Either way, it appears the site has already been thoroughly contaminated, as videos show separatist fighters, journalists, rescue workers, and civilians going through the wreckage.\n\nAs for the larger geopolitical consequences, it's anyone's guess. Obviously, the facts aren't in yet, but feel free to speculate about whether the crash will deescalate the Ukraine crisis or start World War III.",

Vice President Joe Biden, speaking in Detroit, seemed to support that conclusion when he said the passenger plane had apparently been “blown out of the sky.”\n\nUkraine’s president, Petro O. Poroshenko, said in a statement that he was calling for an immediate investigation of the crash of the plane, which was en route to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, from Amsterdam.

But this would be the first commercial airline disaster to result from the hostilities.\n\nDespite the turmoil in eastern Ukraine, the commercial airspace over that part of the country is heavily trafficked and has remained open. Aeroflot, Russia’s national carrier, announced that it had suspended all flights to Ukraine for at least three days.\n\nMalaysia Airlines, still reeling from the mysterious loss of another Boeing 777 flight in March, said it had lost contact with Thursday’s flight, MH17, over Ukraine but offered no further details immediately. Mr. Razak said initially in a Twitter post that he was “shocked by reports that an MH plane crashed. We are launching an immediate investigation.”\n\nPresident Obama, who one day earlier had announced strengthened sanctions against Russia over its support for the eastern Ukraine separatists, spoke by telephone with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and Mr. Putin raised the issue of the reports of the downed plane, White House officials said. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Obama had been briefed about the plane crash.\n\nLater Mr. Obama said the United States government was working to determine whether any Americans had been aboard the flight.

            "text": "Even a relatively unsophisticated military force could take down a passenger jet with a weapon that has been seen in Ukraine.\n\nA Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 has crashed in the Ukraine, in a region that's been marked by battles between the government and a Russian separatist movement.\n\nBefore it crashed, the plane was flying at 33,000 feet, according to The New York Times.\n\nIt is not clear how the plane went down. However, because of the region's instability, the immediate suspicion is that it was shot down. Both the Ukrainian military and the separatists calling themselves the Donetsk People's Republic have denied responsibility.\n\nAndrei Purgin, deputy prime minister of the Donetsk People’s Republic, told the Times, “We don’t have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height.\" Nonetheless, Anton Gerashenko, whom the Associated Press calls \"an adviser to Ukraine's interior minister,\" posted on Facebook that the plane was shot down \"by a missile fired from a Buk launcher.\"\n\nStipulating that we don't know what happened yet to create this tragic situation, it makes sense to test the plausibility of the assertions being made. Is hitting a plane flying at 33,000 feet even within the realm of possibility, given what kinds of weapons technologies the separatists have? Maybe. AP journalists reported seeing an anti-aircraft system resembling what's called a Buk missile system in the disputed region.\n\n\"Purgin said he did not know whether rebel forces owned Buk missile launchers, but said even if they did, there had no fighters capable of operating it,\" the AP wrote.\n\nThe Buk system was developed by the old Soviet Union. Its missile batteries are portable. The missiles themselves are radar guided. If one is in the area, and there are people who can operate it, it has the technical capability to shoot missiles far beyond 33,000 feet.\n\nA passenger jet, in particular, would make an easy target, relative to a fighter jet or a rocket. They are big and they move in very predictable straight lines across the sky. Passenger planes emit a transponder signal, too, which could be used for tracking.\n\nThis is not to say that a particular group shot down the plane, or even that we know, definitively, that the plane was shot down.\n\nBut the point is: it may sound implausible that a group of rebel fighters could take out a 777, but, given the right anti-aircraft weaponry, it is not.",

analysts were focused on an area near the small towns of snizhne and torez about midway between the rebel strongholds of donetsk and luhansk their determination was based on an analysis of the launch plume and trajectory of the missile as detected by an american military spy satellite but the analysis did not pinpoint the origin of the missile launch or identify who launched it those are the

before the cameras himself at the white house to argue that whatever the investigation found russias aid to the insurgents had led to the disaster what we do know is that the violence thats taking place there is facilitated in part in large part because of russian support he said he said europe should pay attention noting that most of the passengers were europeans including 189 from the netherlands that i think sadly brings home the degree to which the stakes are high for europe not simply for the ukrainian people mr obama said and that we have to be firm in our resolve he later called prime minister david cameron of britain and chancellor angela merkel of germany to talk about the disaster he also spoke with prime minister tony abbott of australia which had 27 passengers on

burned on a flowered wheat field thursday in a part of eastern ukraine controlled by prorussia separatists blown out of the sky at 33000 feet by what ukrainian and us officials described as a russianmade antiaircraft missile ukraine accused the separatists of carrying out what it called a terrorist attack us intelligence and military officials said the plane had been destroyed by a russian saseries missile based on surveillance satellite data that showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not its point of origin there were strong indications that those responsible may have errantly downed what they had thought was a military aircraft only to discover to their shock that they had struck a civilian airliner everyone aboard was killed their corpses littered among wreckage that smoldered late into the summer night russias president vladimir v putin blamed ukraines government for creating what he called the conditions for the insurgency in eastern ukraine where separatists have bragged about shooting down at least three ukrainian military aircraft but putin did not specifically deny that a russianmade weapon had felled the malaysian jetliner whatever the cause the news of the crashed plane with a passenger manifest that spanned at least nine countries elevated the insurgency into a new international crisis the day before the us had slapped new sanctions on russia for its support of the prokremlin insurgency that has brought eastwest relations to their lowest point in many years making the crash even more of a shock it was the second time within months that malaysia airlines had suffered a masscasualty flight disaster with international intrigue and with the same model plane a boeing 777200er the government of malaysias prime minister najib razak is still reeling from the unexplained disappearance of flight 370 in march somewhere over the indian ocean he said he was stupefied at the news of flight 17 which had been bound for kuala lumpur the malaysian capital from amsterdam with 283 passengers including three infants and 15 crew members aviation officials said the aircraft had been traveling an approved and heavily trafficked route over eastern ukraine about 20 miles from the russia border when it vanished from radar screens at 215 pm local time with no distress signal this is a tragic day in what has already been a tragic year for malaysia najib told reporters in a televised statement from kuala lumpur if it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice najib said he had spoken with the leaders of ukraine and the netherlands who promised their cooperation he also said that he had spoken with president barack obama and that he and i both agreed that the investigation must not be hindered in any way the remark pointed to concerns about evidence tampering at the crash site which is in an area controlled by prorussia insurgents obama and putin also spoke about the disaster and the broader ukraine crisis white house officials said and putin expressed his condolences to malaysia but in a statement quoted by russias ria novosti news agency putin said this tragedy would not have happened if there was peace in the country if military operations had not resumed in the southeast of ukraine the united nations security council scheduled a meeting on the ukraine crisis for friday morning adding to ukrainian and western suspicions that prorussia separatists were culpable ukraines intelligence agency the state security service known as the sbu released audio from what it said was from intercepted phone calls between separatist rebels and russian military intelligence officers on thursday in the audio the separatists appeared to acknowledge shooting down a civilian plane the ukrainian foreign ministry sent reporters a link to the edited audio of the calls with english subtitles posted on youtube by the sbu according to a translation of the russian audio by the englishlanguage kyiv post the recording begins with a separatist commander identified as igor bezler telling a russian military intelligence official we have just shot down a plane in another call a man who seems to be at the scene of the crash says that a group of cossack militiamen shot down the plane he adds that it was a passenger plane and that the debris contains no sign of military equipment asked if there are any weapons he says absolutely nothing civilian items medical equipment towels toilet paper asked if there are any documents among the debris the man says yes of one indonesian student myroslava petsa a ukrainian journalist in kiev said that the voices in the audio sounded shocked by what they found in the wreckage by thursday night us intelligence analysts were increasingly focused on a theory that rebels had used a russianmade sa11 surfacetoair missile system to shoot down the aircraft and operated on their own firecontrol radar outside the checks and balances of the national ukrainian airdefense network to shoot down the aircraft everything we have and it is not much says separatists a senior pentagon official said that said theres still a lot of conjecture russian troops who have been deployed along the eastern ukraine border have similar sa11 systems as well as larger weapons known as sa20s pentagon officials said petro o poroshenko ukraines president said he had called the dutch prime minister mark rutte to express his condolences and to invite dutch experts to assist in the investigation i would like to note that we are calling this not an incident not a catastrophe but a terrorist act poroshenko said reporters arriving at the scene near the town of grabovo described dozens of lifeless bodies strewn about many intact in a field dotted with purple flowers and remnants of the plane scattered across a road lined with fire engines and emergency vehicles it fell down in pieces one rescue worker said as tents were set up to gather the dead the carcass of the plane was still smoldering and rescue workers moved through the dark field with flashlights for months eastern ukraine has been the scene of a violent prorussia separatist uprising rebels have claimed responsibility for attacking a ukrainian military jet as it landed in the city of luhansk on june 14 and for felling an an26 transport plane on monday and an su25 jet fighter on wednesday but this would be the first commercial airline disaster to result from the hostilities despite the turmoil the commercial airspace over eastern ukraine is heavily trafficked and has remained open questions are likely to be raised in the coming days about why the traffic line which is controlled by ukraine and russia was not closed earlier with the news of the disaster on thursday the ukrainian authorities declared the eastern part of the country a nofly zone us and european carriers rerouted their flights and aeroflot russias national carrier announced that it had suspended all flights to ukraine for at least three days the conspicuous exception was aeroflot flights to crimea the southern peninsula annexed by russia in march a pivotal point in the ukraine crisis it was unclear late thursday whether any americans had been aboard the flight russias interfax news agency said there had been no russians aboard in amsterdam a malaysia airlines official huib gorter said the plane had carried 154 dutch passengers 45 malaysians including the crew 27 australians 12 indonesians nine britons four germans four belgians three filipinos and one canadian the rest of the passengers had not been identified andrei purgin deputy prime minister of the donetsk peoples republic an insurgent group in eastern ukraine denied in a telephone interview that the rebels had anything to do with the loss of the jet he said that the rebels had shot down ukrainian planes before but that their antiaircraft weapons could reach only to around 4000 meters far below the cruising level of passenger jets we dont have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height purgin said he also did not rule out the possibility that ukrainian forces themselves had shot down the plane remember the black sea plane disaster he said referring to the 2001 crash of a siberia airlines passenger jet bound for novosibirsk from tel aviv that the ukrainians shot down by accident during a military training exercise in comments broadcast on ukrainian television vitali klitschko the mayor of kiev and a former heavyweight boxing champion said the crash illustrated the risks to peace in europe of the fighting in eastern ukraine this is not just a local conflict in donetsk and luhansk but a fullscale war in the center of europe he said im certain the international community this time will pay attention and understand",

systems to e ukraine ahead of the malaysian plane crash the ukrainian military has several batteries of buk surfacetoair missile systems with at least 27 launchers capable of bringing down highflying jets in the donetsk region where the malaysian passenger plane crashed russian defense ministry said according to the russian defense ministry information units of the armed forces of ukraine located in the crashsite are equipped with antiaircraft missile systems of bukm1 these complexes in their tactical and technical characteristics are capable of detecting air targets at ranges of up to 160 kilometers and hit them at full altitude range at a distance of over 30 kilometers the ministrys statement reads as cited by ria earlier itartass and interfax news agencies were citing a source familiar with the issue who said that another battery of buk systems is currently being prepared for shipment to donetsk region from the ukrainian city of kharkov the donetsk region remains the scene of heavy fighting between government troops and the forces of the opposition which refused to recognize the regime change in kiev and demand federalization a malaysian airlines aircraft en route from amsterdam to malaysia crashed in eastern ukraine – not far from the russian border – on thursday there were reportedly 283 people and 15 crew members on board the boeing777 plane who reportedly all died in the crash there were unconfirmed reports the malaysian plane was travelling at an altitude of over 10000 meters when it was allegedly hit by a missile theres no way that the selfdefense forces in donetsk region are in possession of such complex weaponry he stressed only s300 and buk surfacetoair missile systems are capable of hitting targets at such altitude the source said buk is a family of selfpropelled mediumrange surfacetoair missile systems developed by the former ussr and russia to engage targets at an engagement altitude of 1100025000 meters depending on the model ria novosti evgeny yepanchintsev chances are high that the malaysian plane was really downed by the ukrainian antiaircraft defense yury karash pilot and aviation expert told rt a boeing777 is an extremely reliable piece of machinery modern planes dont just crash with no reason he said let us recall how a ukrainian missile downed russian tu154 aircraft ten years ago i cant completely exclude the possibility the boeing777 was also hit by a missile i dont know who couldve shot it down but i can allege that it was most likely the ukrainian armed forces simply because its military – antiaircraft defense in particular – are unfortunately unqualified as judging by the overall state of the ukrainian armed forces insufficient attention has been paid to their training karash added reports in the western media hurried to blame the selfdefense forces of the peoples republic of donetsk for bringing the plane down afp photo dominique faget the claims were denied by the representatives of the donetsk peoples republic saying that its the ukrainian military which destroyed the aircraft we simply dont have such air defense systems our manportable air defense systems have a firing range 3000 – 4000 meters the boeing was flying at a much higher altitude sergey kavtaradze special representative for the prime minister of the donetsk peoples republic explained kavtaradze also expressed condolences to the relatives of all of those who lost their lives in the tragedy ihs janes defense analyst nick de larrinaga also shared the belief that the selfdefense forces lack the capability to bring the malaysian plane down at normal cruising altitude a civilian passenger aircraft would be out of the range of the sort of manned portable air defense systems that we have seen proliferate in rebel hands in east ukraine he said in a statement but the aircraft would be within range of buk or other mediumrange surfacetoair missile systems he stressed both russia and ukraine have such sam systems in their inventories the expert added it seems unlikely that the selfdefense forces couldve used buk surfacetoair missile systems to down the malaysian plane retired brig gen kevin ryan the director of the defense and intelligence project at the belfer center for science and international affairs said it takes a lot of training and a lot of coordination to fire one of these and hit something he told cnn this is not the kind of weapon a couple of guys are going to pull out of a garage and fire according to ryan if the plane was really taken down then it was done by a professional military force jetliner explodes over ukraine struck by missile officials say grabovo ukraine — a malaysia airlines boeing 777 with 298 people aboard exploded crashed and burned on a flowered wheat field thursday in a part of eastern ukraine controlled by prorussia separatists blown out of the sky at 33000 feet by what ukrainian and american officials described as a russianmade antiaircraft missile ukraine accused the separatists of carrying out what it called a terrorist attack american intelligence and military officials said the plane had been destroyed by a russian saseries missile based on surveillance satellite data that showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not its point of origin there were strong indications that those responsible may have errantly downed what they had thought was a military aircraft only to discover to their shock that they had struck a civilian airliner everyone aboard was killed their corpses littered among wreckage that smoldered late into the summer night russias president vladimir v putin blamed ukraines government for creating what he called conditions for insurgency in eastern ukraine where separatists have bragged about shooting down at least three ukrainian military aircraft but mr putin did not specifically deny that a russianmade weapon had felled the malaysian jetliner whatever the cause the news of the crashed plane with a passenger manifest that spanned at least nine countries elevated the insurgency into a new international crisis the day before the united states had slapped new sanctions on russia for its support of the prokremlin insurgency which has brought eastwest relations to their lowest point in many years making the crash even more of a shock it was the second time within months that malaysia airlines had suffered a masscasualty flight disaster with international intrigue — and with the same model plane a boeing 777200er the government of malaysias prime minister najib razak is still reeling from the unexplained disappearance of flight 370 over the indian ocean in march mr najib said he was stupefied at the news of flight 17 which had been bound for kuala lumpur the malaysian capital from amsterdam with 283 passengers including three infants and 15 crew members aviation officials said the plane had been traveling an approved and heavily trafficked route over eastern ukraine about 20 miles from the russia border when it vanished from radar screens with no distress signal this is a tragic day in what has already been a tragic year for malaysia mr najib told reporters in a televised statement from kuala lumpur if it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice mr najib said he had spoken with the leaders of ukraine and the netherlands who promised their cooperation he also said that he had spoken with president obama and that he and i both agreed that the investigation must not be hindered in any way the remark seemed to point to concerns about evidence tampering at the crash site which is in an area controlled by prorussia insurgents mr obama and mr putin also spoke about the disaster and the broader ukraine crisis white house officials said and mr putin expressed his condolences but in a statement quoted by russias ria novosti news agency mr putin said this tragedy would not have happened if there was peace in the country if military operations had not resumed in the southeast of ukraine the united nations security council scheduled a meeting on the ukraine crisis for friday morning adding to ukrainian and western suspicions that prorussia separatists were culpable ukraines intelligence agency the state security service known as the sbu released audio from what it said were intercepted phone calls between separatist rebels and russian military intelligence officers on thursday in the audio the separatists appeared to acknowledge shooting down a civilian plane the ukrainian foreign ministry sent reporters a link to the edited audio of the calls with english subtitles posted on youtube by the sbu according to a translation of the russian audio by the englishlanguage kyiv post the recording begins with a separatist commander identified as igor bezler telling a russian military intelligence official we have just shot down a plane photo separatists at the site of the crash of malaysia airlines flight 17 near the settlement of grabovo the region has been roiled by fighting between prorussian militants and the ukrainian government and at least one military aircraft has been shot down credit maxim zmeyevreuters in another call a man who seems to be at the scene of the crash says that a group of cossack militiamen shot down the plane he adds that it was a passenger jet and that the debris contains no sign of military equipment asked if there are any weapons he says absolutely nothing civilian items medical equipment towels toilet paper asked if there are any documents among the debris the man says yes of one indonesian student myroslava petsa a ukrainian journalist in kiev said that the people in the audio sounded shocked by what they had found in the wreckage by thursday night american intelligence analysts were increasingly focused on a theory that rebels had used a russianmade sa11 surfacetoair missile system to shoot down the aircraft and operated on their own firecontrol radar outside the checks and balances of the national ukrainian airdefense network everything we have and it is not much says separatists a senior pentagon official said that said theres still a lot of conjecture photo the crash site of a malaysia airlines 777 carrying 298 people in the donetsk region of ukraine credit dmitry lovetskyassociated press russian troops who have been deployed along the border with eastern ukraine have similar sa11 systems as well as larger weapons known as sa20s pentagon officials said petro o poroshenko ukraines president said he had called the dutch prime minister mark rutte to express his condolences and to invite dutch experts to assist in the investigation i would like to note that we are calling this not an incident not a catastrophe but a terrorist act mr poroshenko said reporters arriving at the scene near the town of grabovo described dozens of lifeless bodies strewn about many intact in a field dotted with purple flowers and remnants of the plane scattered across a road lined with fire engines and emergency vehicles it fell down in pieces one rescue worker said as tents were set up to gather the dead the carcass of the plane was still smoldering and rescue workers moved through the dark field with flashlights for months eastern ukraine has been the scene of a violent prorussia separatist uprising rebels have claimed responsibility for attacking a ukrainian military jet as it landed in the city of luhansk on june 14 and for felling an an26 transport plane on monday and an su25 fighter jet on wednesday but this would be the first commercial airline disaster to result from the hostilities despite the turmoil the commercial airspace over eastern ukraine is heavily trafficked and has remained open questions are likely to be raised in the coming days about why the traffic line which is controlled by ukraine and russia was not closed earlier with the news of the crash on thursday ukraine declared the eastern part of the country a nofly zone american and european carriers rerouted their flights and aeroflot russias national carrier announced that it had suspended all flights to ukraine for at least three days the conspicuous exception was aeroflot flights to crimea the southern peninsula that russia annexed in march a pivotal point in the ukraine crisis it was unclear late thursday whether any americans had been aboard the flight russias interfax news agency said there had been no russians aboard in amsterdam a malaysia airlines official huib gorter said the plane had carried 154 dutch passengers 45 malaysians including the crew and 27 australians 12 indonesians nine britons four belgians four germans three filipinos and one canadian the rest of the passengers had not been identified prof david cooper director of the kirby institute at the university of new south wales in sydney australia said that a prominent aids researcher traveling to the 20th international aids conference in melbourne was among those on the flight professor cooper who was heading to the conference from sydney said he was unaware how many other passengers were also on their way to the conference which is scheduled to start on sunday andrei purgin deputy prime minister of the donetsk peoples republic an insurgent group in eastern ukraine denied in a telephone interview that the

remember the black sea plane disaster he said referring to the 2001 crash of a siberia airlines passenger jet bound for novosibirsk from tel aviv that the ukrainians shot down by accident during a military training exercise in comments broadcast on ukrainian television vitali klitschko the mayor of kiev said the crash illustrated the threat to peace in europe posed by the fighting in eastern ukraine this is not just a local conflict in donetsk and luhansk but a fullscale war in the center of europe he said im certain the international community this time will pay attention and understand",

missile american officials have confirmed the plane was traveling at about 30000 feet 9144 meters according to tracking information from a military spy satellite the satellite was unable to detect where exactly the missile was fired military and intelligence analysts are using mathematical formulas highspeed computers and other sensors to try to pin down the missiles point of origin other analysts will work with the ukrainian authorities to recover and analyze pieces of the missile and the aircraft to help determine what kind of missile was fired the officials said the plane crashed and burned on thursday in an eastern ukraine wheat field near the russian border in an area roiled by fighting between prorussian separatists and ukrainian forces ukrainian officials called the crash an act of terrorism vice president joseph r biden jr of the united states speaking in detroit said the plane apparently has been shot down shot down not an accident blown out of the sky this is truly a grave situation mr biden said nearly 300 souls have been lost the families need consolation and our prayers and many questions need to be answered and well get those answers and well take action accordingly he added its important we get to the bottom of this sooner than later because of the possible repercussions that can flow beyond from this beyond the tragic loss of life ukraines president petro o poroshenko said in a statement that he was calling for an immediate investigation of the crash of the plane which was en route to kuala lumpur malaysia from amsterdam there were no reported survivors among the 280 passengers and 15 crew members mr poroshenko said he had called the dutch prime minister mark rutte to express his condolences and to invite dutch experts to assist in the investigation i would like to note that we are calling this not an incident not a catastrophe but a terrorist act mr poroshenko said malaysias prime minister najib razak called for an investigation at the crash site and the unfettered cooperation of local authorities malaysia is unable to verify the cause of this tragedy he said no stone will be left unturned he added if it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down we insist that the perpetrators must be brought to justice president obama spoke with mr poroshenko and russias president vladimir v putin from aboard air force one reporters arriving at the scene near the town of hrabovo described dozens of lifeless bodies strewn about mostly intact in a field dotted with purple flowers with remnants of the plane scattered across a road lined with fire engines and emergency vehicles it fell down in pieces said one rescue worker as tents were set up to gather the dead one passenger in a black sweater lay on her back with blood streaming down her face and her left arm raised the carcass of the plane was still smoldering and rescue workers moved through the dark field with flashlights dogs barked in the distance and the air was filled with a bitter smell a regional airline official said the plane had been flying at about 33000 feet 10000 meters when radar lost track of it for months eastern ukraine has been the scene of a violent prorussian separatist uprising in which a number of military aircraft have been downed but this would be the first commercial airline disaster to result from the hostilities despite the turmoil in eastern ukraine the commercial airspace over that part of the country is heavily trafficked and has remained open aeroflot russias national carrier announced that it had suspended all flights to ukraine for at least three days malaysia airlines still reeling from the mysterious loss of another boeing 777 flight in march said it had lost contact with thursdays flight mh17 over ukraine but offered no further details immediately mr razak said initially in a twitter post that he was shocked by reports that an mh plane crashed we are launching an immediate investigation president obama who one day earlier had announced strengthened sanctions against russia over its support for the eastern ukraine separatists spoke by telephone with mr putin who raised the issue of the reports of the downed plane white house officials said josh earnest the white house press secretary said mr obama had been briefed about the plane crash later mr obama said the united states government was working to determine whether any americans had been aboard the flight russias interfax news agency said there had been no russians aboard there was no immediate word from the kremlin about the substance of the obamaputin telephone call the kremlin put out a short statement saying that putin had a previously scheduled telephone conversation with mr obama the parties had a detailed discussion about the crisis in ukraine the statement said putin repeated the need for an immediate ceasefire and objected to what he said was ukrainian army fire striking inside russia russian news agencies said putin also spoke by telephone to the president of malaysia and offered his condolences mr rutte the dutch prime minister said in a statement said he was deeply shocked by the crash a lot remains unclear about the reason circumstances and those on board he said i have just called with the ukrainian president the dutch state news agency quoted tour operator wtcnl as saying that around 20 to 30 dutch and belgian citizens had been on board andrei purgin deputy prime minister of the donetsk peoples republic the insurgent group in eastern ukraine denied in a telephone interview that the rebels had anything to do with the loss of the passenger jet he said that the rebels had shot down ukrainian planes before but that their antiaircraft weapons could reach only to around 4000 meters 13000 feet far below the cruising level of passenger jets we dont have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height he said he said that the plane had apparently come down in an area of ukrainian military operations and that it was not out of the question that the ukrainians themselves shot it down remember the black sea plane disaster he said referring to the 2001 crash of a siberian airlines passenger jet bound for novosibirsk from tel aviv that the ukrainians shot down by accident during a military training exercise anton heraschenko an adviser at ukraines interior ministry said on his facebook page that the malaysia airlines plane had been brought down by a russianmade buk or beech antiaircraft system russian missile systems are named for trees a reference book published by rosoboronexport the russian state weapons export monopoly describes the buk antiaircraft missile system as designed to target both low and highflying aircraft to a maximum height of 72000 feet 22000 meters mr heraschenko wrote that earlier thursday people in eastern ukraine supporting the central government had reported seeing a buk system moved from the town of torez toward the town of snezhnoye a commander of a rebel unit in donetsk said we could have shot down three planes over donetsk yesterday but we didnt because they could have been civilians he said the rebel forces did not have the buk system in comments broadcast on ukrainian television vitali klitschko the mayor of kiev and former heavyweight boxing champion said the crash illustrated the risks to peace in europe of the fighting in eastern ukraine this is not just a local conflict in donetsk and luhansk but a fullscale war in the center of europe he said im certain the international community this time will pay attention and understand source the new york times",

            "body": "attack on flight 17 brings ukraine crisis to europes doorstep al jazeera america an international investigation is underway to determine who fired a russianmade missile at malaysian airlines flight 17 on thursday blowing the passenger jet out of the sky and killing all 298 people on board but with washingtons statements on friday that the missile came from an area in eastern ukraine held by prorussian separatists the west seems to have made up its mind about the culpable party if its true that russia or its separatist proxies in ukraine are responsible for downing flight 17 the tragedy will vindicate kievs insistence that crushing the separatists in ukraines east — where flight 17s wreckage is scattered — is not only a ukrainian imperative but a regional one after months of waffling and divisions among european leaders about how to deal with perceived russian aggression in ukraine many feel its time for action there are consequences to escalated conflict in ukraine its not localized its not going to be contained president barack obama said in an address at the white house on friday the loss of more than 200 europeans he said sadly brings home that the stakes are high for europe not just for the ukrainian people washington and kiev have long been frustrated with their european allies tepid response to the crisis which has permitted the russianarmed separatist uprising to expand unabated for months since russia annexed ukraines crimean peninsula in march european leaders have hesitated to give moscow much more than a slap on the wrist in part because russian president vladimir putin has threatened to close the pipeline from russia that supplies 30 percent of europes natural gas but also because provoking a fullon russian invasion into ukraine could set off a regional conflict in the european unions backyard but if ever there was a window for europe to reverse course and punish a country it counts among its most crucial trading partners the downing of a civilian airplane with 200 europeans on board could be it ukraines leaders certainly hope so no sooner had the plane crashed than kiev lawmakers deduced that months of war were spiraling into something far graver — a questionable position if flight 17s crash was accidental this is not just a local conflict in donetsk and luhansk but a fullscale war in the center of europe vitali klitschko kievs mayor said on ukrainian television thursday night im certain the international community this time will pay attention and understand but us lawmakers have also begun to pile public pressure on their european allies calling on them to at least match the already biting american sanctions former us secretary of state hillary clinton forced the spotlight onto europe thursday night telling pbs in an interview that outrage should fill the halls of europes capitals if there is evidence linking russia to this that should inspire the europeans to do much more the us which has icier ties to moscow and is much less invested in russias economy has taken a harder line in the ukraine showdown on wednesday the obama administration compounded its sanctions against russia with new measures that targeted key financial energy and defense companies — the farthestreaching measures to date european leaders indicated they would consider expediting and widening the eus latest round of sanctions against russian oligarchs and companies announced earlier this week but apart from a shared outrage over flight 17 it was too early to tell whether the suspected tragic overreach by ukraines rebels would push europe to the brink the only thing we know for sure is that this is a turning point said joerg forbrig an eastern europe expert with the germanmarshall fund in berlin this will turn public and political opinion against russia in a way that we havent seen in this conflict so far we dont want this war amid plane wreckage villagers seek answers around site of downed aircraft in rural area controlled by prorussian separatists residents witness scenes of horror perhaps realizing he could be in even hotter water over his alleged support for the rebellion in eastern ukraine putin indirectly blamed kiev in a statement thursday saying this tragedy would not have happened if there was peace in the country if military operations had not resumed in the southeast of ukraine but world leaders even those who have tacitly supported putin during the ukraine episode have grown weary of that narrative longsimmering outrage against his brazen aggression there may have reached a boil among leaders of countries that lost lives aboard flight 17 australian prime minister tony abbott mourning the loss of 27 citizens in thursdays attack called putins casting of blame deeply deeply unsatisfactory even china which has offered tacit support on the united nations security council and refrained from vetoing the un resolution to declare russias annexation of crimea illegal may seek to distance itself from a russianbacked attack — even if inadvertent — on an asian airliner forbrig noted after weeks of indicating he might be ready to abandon the separatists to their fate in the face of kievs emboldened counterterrorist operation putin appeared to reverse course the past couple of weeks upping military support and diplomatic efforts for the rebels in a meeting in berlin earlier this month moscow sought to convince france and germany that an urgent ceasefire was needed shifting focus from kievs insistence that putting proper controls on the ukrainerussia border — across which fighters and arms flow freely — was a top priority russias ultimate goal now as ever is anyones guess putins momentum has unraveled since flight 17 was downed analysts say though they are split on what that means for violence on the ground the russians wanted something similar to transnistria or abkhazia said forbrig referring to the ethnicrussian breakaway regions in moldova and georgia where russian peacekeeping forces control security basically theyve been systematically building up the case for a peacekeeping invasion of ukraine thatll change as of today putin on friday reiterated the call for a ceasefire which all sides seem to support but the stakes could be much higher this time around if ceasefire talks collapse again if ukrainian president petro poroshenko has held back at all in his counterterrorist operation wary of drawing a russian invasion from the east he may recalculate his strategy after the flight 17 attack this really makes it impossible for poroshenko to not take action more decisively in donetsk and luhansk how could he not said ian bremmer president of the political risk consultancy eurasia group in an interview with bloomberg that means a much more bloody account between ukrainians and russians and certainly makes it much more likely that the russian hand directly would respond to that on the other hand flight 17 could punctuate for putin that his venture in ukraine which initially had the effect of pulling ukraine away from europe has badly backfired as the west piles on sanctions and the separatists prove more and more difficult to control the russian leader could be ready for the longdiscussed exit ramp in the coming days according to tim frye a professor of postsoviet foreign policy at columbia university putin will be recalculating whether the rebels are more of an asset or a liability",

deciding whether they would parlay the assassination of an austrohungarian archduke into a massive regional conflict from afar the united states watched as continental diplomats and generals jostled for advantage and prepared their empires for the crimson slaughterhouse that was world war i if summer 1914 had any simplicity it was that the july crisis is singular only one geopolitical emergency threatened to erupt in hemispheric combat july 2014 is different thursdays downing of a civilian boeing 777 in a quickcharred ukrainian wheat field followed within hours by israels ground invasion of gaza intensified a summer of strife that is testing the obama administration and its hopes to diminish the use of american muscle overseas in afghanistan a scheduled us military withdrawal exposes the uncertain future of american attempts to eradicate terror havens in south asia in iraq the us thus far has had minimal involvement in baghdads frantic efforts to thwart marauding islamic militants in pakistan us attack drones assist that nations energized campaign against the taliban in syria a triumphal bashar assad on wednesday took his oath of office for a third term as president in a ceremony that — despite the deaths of 160000 people in his realm — joyfully celebrated his survival and defiance the disintegration of the malaysia airlines plane and of the 298 lives that ended with it instantly provoked accusations that russia somehow was to blame — perhaps for arming and encouraging the russialeaning separatists of eastern ukraine i would like to note that we are calling this not an incident not a catastrophe but a terrorist act ukrainian president petro poroshenko said in a statement even as rescue teams searched — in futility it appears — for survivors that plot line is intuitively appealing but at this writing not close to proven if as early reports state the plane was struck at an altitude of 33000 feet the list of possible suspects abruptly narrows thats far too high for many groundbased weapons but its comfortably within the 72000foot range of the russianmade buk or beech antiaircraft system whoever the culprit the sight of bodies by the dozens dumped around the village of hrabove is one more vivid punctuation to this summer of international strife russia and ukraine have been accusing one another of assorted mortar attacks rocket launches and bombings on thursday ukraine charged that a russian aircraft had shot down one of ukraines fighter jets also over ukrainian soil if that accusation proves true it would mark a resumption of russian military action in areas of ukraine where the separatists — many of them russian citizens — have been fighting ukraines military as assigned or unwitting proxies for moscow one day before the boeing fell president barack obama increased sanctions against russia over the belligerence in ukraine the sanctions curb us financing to important russian firms but arent so strict as to cut the companies global business dealings russian president vladimir putins retort that the sanctions would bring us relations with his country to a dead end strike us as intended for domestic consumption in russia wed be startled if he was so rash as to knowingly permit let alone order the demolition of a malaysian plane near air corridors where russian passenger flights also operate why this happened is a mystery the world hopes is swiftly and convincingly solved israels assault on gaza and its supply tunnels for hamas and other extremists is impossible to judge as unprovoked or indefensible despite israels 10day bombardment of gaza the rocket fire that had initiated these aerial exchanges continued to imperil israeli citizens none of these international hot spots scorches american soil but some of them do affect american citizens obama is sending several hundred troops on a limited mission to iraq and reports that americans lay among the air victims in ukraine guarantees highly publicized anger in this country as mourning families gather for funerals and demand that washington deliver justice what that will mean we cant suggest without learning much more early assessments of blame after plane crashes are always available — in peoples minds they bring tantalizing order to the unknown — but notoriously unreliable this we do know obama and putin now stand at a dangerous intersection we dont anticipate the outbreak of war more extensive than the conflicts already roiling parts of the globe where americans have important interests — and important allies whom we have pledged to defend we do though recall what happened at another dangerous intersection this one in the city of sarajevo in 1914 who could anticipate where the killing of an archduke would lead and who now can anticipate where

department of foreign affairs and trade said it was investigating a number of australians abroad the boeing 777 bodies and burning wreckage were scattered over the countryside near donetsk there were also reports of 23 us and nine uk passengers the flight carried a crew of 15 us intelligence officials confirmed to american media that a surfacetoair missile brought down the airline however which side used the missile was less clear officials said eastern ukraine has been roiled for months by a violent prorussian separatist uprising in which a number of military aircraft have been downed but this would be the first commercial airline disaster to result from the hostilities despite the turmoil in eastern ukraine the commercial airspace over that part of the country is a heavily trafficked route and has remained open malaysia airlines still reeling from the mysterious loss of another boeing 777 flight in march confirmed that ukrainian air traffic control lost contact with flight mh17 at

that it saved fuel to fly over this space he said that we get what we pay for meaning that some airlines avoid this type of risky airspace but the fuel cost is higher and therefore the seat cost is higher i guess this is what happens when we get drunken poorly trained russian separatists in ukraine equipped with sophisticated surface to air missiles i would expect some serious repercussions over this act profile reply with quote go to top barista 18 jul 2014 0842 am post 4 posts 149 group gold member member 2568 joined 03102012 i think we can certainly assume the plane was shot down this is where things will get murky and there will be nowhere for them to get murkier than eastern ukraine i would observe that the ukraine rebels have not shown any air capability yet so it is unlikely the ukraine military shot down the aircraft as a mistake the rebels certainly have been shooting down aircraft these have been aircraft flying at low levels within direct line of sight in eastern ukraine as opposed to those cruising at 10000 metres this is something the ukraine government has been trying to highlight for mine it would boil down to maybe the ukraine government wanting to draw extra attention to their calls for the rest of the world to do something about the rebels against possibly rebels trying to make a point they can shoot down things they dont need to there are certainly some hard core issues and players involved here involving both sides both capable of considerable brutality the oligarchs in ukraine are stepping up their fight over the spoils of ousting the previous regime httpwwwbneeucontentukrainianoligarchssteppingfightspoils maybe one of them sees an advantage in bringing attention to the region those sanctions announced by the us the other day against russian companies are utterly meaningless – essentially sanctions again 4 companies which wont feel them another classic example of the west needing to be seen to do something without doing something and i would further point in the direction of the recent donations to the uk conservatives from one andrei borodin formerly bank of moscow who did a runner to uk – latest in a long line essentially

by a russian saseries missile based on surveillance satellite data that showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not its point of origin ukrainian leaders have implicated prorussian

conclusions about the crash or how the us should respond the chair of the senate intelligence committee california democrat dianne feinstein said if evidence emerges that russia was involved that would obviously be extremely concerning sen saxby chambliss rga said its way too early to tell exactly what happened the key word in all of this is if if it is determined that the separatists are

2014 moscow — a malaysia airlines boeing 777 with 295 people aboard crashed on thursday in eastern ukraine near the russian border an area roiled by fighting between prorussian separatists and ukrainian forces ukrainian officials said the plane might have been shot down possibly by a russianmade antiaircraft system ukraines president petro o poroshenko said in a statement that he was calling for an immediate investigation of the crash of the plane which was en route to kuala lumpur malaysia from amsterdam there were no reported survivors among the 280 passengers and 15 crew members reporters arriving at the scene near the town of grabovo described dozens of lifeless bodies mostly intact in a wheat field with purple flowers with pieces of the plane scattered across a road lined with fire engines and emergency vehicles one passenger in a black sweater lay on her back with blood streaming down her face and her left arm raised a regional airline official said the plane had been flying at about 33000 feet when radar lost track of it eastern ukraine has been roiled for months by a violent prorussian separatist uprising in which a number of military aircraft have been downed but this would be the first commercial airline disaster to result from the hostilities despite the turmoil in eastern ukraine the commercial airspace over that part of the country is a heavily trafficked route and has remained open malaysia airlines still reeling from the mysterious loss of another boeing 777 flight in march said it had lost contact with the flight mh17 over ukraine but offered no further details immediately malaysias prime minister najib razak said in a twitter post that he was shocked by reports that an mh plane crashed we are launching an immediate investigation president obama who one day earlier had announced strengthened sanctions against russia over its support for the eastern ukraine separatists spoke by telephone with president vladimir v putin of russia and mr putin raised the issue of the reports of the downed plane white house officials said josh earnest the white house press secretary said mr obama had been briefed about the plane crash later mr obama said the united states government was working to determine whether any americans had been aboard the flight russias interfax news agency said there had been no russians aboard there was no immediate word from the kremlin about the substance of the obamaputin telephone call although russian news agencies said that mr putin had telephoned the president of malaysia to offer his condolences the kremlin put out a short statement saying that mr putin had a previously scheduled telephone conversation with mr obama the parties had a detailed discussion about the crisis in ukraine the statement said mr putin repeated the need for an immediate ceasefire and objected to what he said was ukrainian army fire striking inside russia andrei purgin deputy prime minister of the donetsk peoples republic the insurgent group in eastern ukraine denied in a telephone interview that the rebels had anything to do with the loss of the passenger jet he said that the rebels had shot down ukrainian planes before but that their antiaircraft weapons could reach only to around 4000 meters far below the cruising level of passenger jets we dont have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height he said he said the plane apparently came down in an area of ukrainian military operations and that it was not out of the question that the ukrainians themselves shot it down remember the black sea plane disaster he said referring to the 2001 crash of a siberian airlines passenger jet bound for novosibirsk from tel aviv that the ukrainians shot down by accident during a military training exercise anton geraschenko an adviser at the ukraine interior ministry said on his facebook page that the malaysia airlines plane had been brought down by a russianmade buk or beech antiaircraft system russian missile systems are named for trees a reference book published by rosoboronexport the russian state weapons export monopoly describes the buk antiaircraft missile system as designed to target both low and highflying aircraft to a maximum height of 72000 feet mr geraschenko wrote that earlier thursday people in eastern ukraine supporting the central government had reported seeing a buk system moved from the town of torez toward the town of snezhnoye a commander of a rebel unit in donetsk said we could have shot down three planes over donetsk yesterday but we didnt because they could have been civilians he said the rebel forces did not have the buk system malaysia airlines mh17 shot down by rebels – ukrainian official astro awani july 18 2014 kuala kubu

shot down last week in eastern ukraine killing all 298 passengers and crew on board the aircrafts black boxes which could hold information about the crash in rebelheld eastern ukraine were handed to malaysian officials this morning weve been calling for an investigation lead by icao the reason for that is that the rebels as we understand do not trust the government of kiev said vorobyeva thats why they were reluctant to hand over anything including the black boxes to the ukrainian side because they are afraid the evidence would be tampered with reuters mh17 did not deviate kuala lumpur

continued communication in good faith mr borodai and his people have so far given their cooperation i ask that all parties continue to work together to ensure that this agreement is honoured that the remains of our people are returned that the black box is handed over and that the international team is granted full access to the site only then can the investigation into mh17 truly begin only then can the victims be afforded the respect they deserve we need to know what caused the plane to crash and who was responsible for it so that justice may be done in recent days there were times i wanted

his country would view a russian veto of the resolution very badly adding that no reasonable person could object to its wording having these people in control of the site is like leaving criminals in

insurgents in ukraine and allow a fullscale investigation the rebels have been blamed around the world for downing the plane though putin blamed ukraines government in a statement released prior to

apparently shot down over rebelheld eastern ukraine was flying over airspace that a number of other asian carriers had already abandoned months ago because of security concerns south koreas two main airlines korean air and asiana as well as australias qantas and taiwans china airlines said they had all rerouted flights from as early as the beginning of march when russian troops moved into crimea we stopped flying over ukraine because of safety concerns asiana spokeswoman lee hyomin said korean air moved its flight paths 250 kilometres 160 miles south of ukraine from march 3 due to the political unrest in the region an official for the carrier told afp a qantas spokeswoman said its london to dubai service used to fly over ukraine but the route was changed several months ago while taiwans china airlines diverted its flights from april 3 quizzed as to why malaysia airlines had not taken similar precautions malaysian prime minister najib razak said international air authorities had deemed the flight path secure the aircrafts flight route was declared safe by the international civil aviation organization and the international air transportation association has stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions he said rerouting would have involved a longer flighttime and therefore higher fuel costs singapore airlines said in a statement that it had been using ukrainian airspace but had rerouted all our flights to alternative corridors away from the region it was not immediately clear when the route change was put into affect hong kongs cathay pacific said it had not been using ukrainian airspace for quite some time and pakistan international airlines said it had rerouted some time ago according to the european flight safety body eurocontrol the ukrainian authorities declared the east of the country a nofly zone shortly after the malaysian airliner went down with 298 people on board european and us airlines rerouted their flights as kiev said flight mh17 was shot down in a terrorist attack and a us official said intelligence analysts strongly believe it was downed by a surfacetoair missile eurocontrol said the doomed plane was flying at a level known as 330 or approximately 10000 metres or 33000 feet when it disappeared from radar screens the route itself had been closed to level 320 but was cleared for those flying at the malaysian planes altitude gerry soejatman a consultant with the jakartabased whitesky aviation chartered flight provider said airlines that flew over conflict zones were not necessarily negligent every airline does its own risk assessment soejatman said adding that flying above 30000 feet was generally considered secure given the level of training and sophisticated weaponry required to shoot down a plane at that height ten years ago youd be an idiot to fly over iraq below 15000 feet but over 30000 feet was very safe so its about the level of risk i think this will send a message to airlines to have a closer look at conflict zones when they choose to fly over them and gain a better understanding of what equipment is on the ground he said air india and thai airways said they had both started rerouting flights away from ukraine as a direct result of the malaysian crash some of our flights used to pass through ukrainian airspace but as of today all of our flights are totally avoiding ukrainian airspace a thai airways spokeswoman said air china and china eastern airways had a total of 28 flights a week passing over eastern ukraine but chinas civil aviation

not even know it a missile like this typically closes in from behind there is no reason for him to have seen it he said charles oman a lecturer at the department of aeronautics and astronautics at the massachusetts institute of technology said it was too early to draw conclusions he said terrorism was one possible consideration but noted that the security out of amsterdam was competent given the military conflict in the region one has to be concerned that identities could have been mistaken he said in an email malaysia airlines was especially criticised for the way it handled the communications around the missing jetliner which presented unique challenges because of the uncertainty facing the relatives of those on board with the plane crashing thursday over land and its wreckage already located there will be no such uncertainty but the investigation will be just as sensitive there will be legal and diplomatic implications depending on who was responsible the airline and the malaysian transport ministry took a lot of hits for the way they handled mh370 due to their inexperience oman said hopefully they will do better this time the accident will surely inflict more

httpwwwsmhcomaubusinessaviationmh17disasterflightsoverwarzonesbecauseitscheaper20140718zua0yhtmlixzz37mept3yd airlines across the world on thursday night imposed a nofly zone over ukraine as questions grew over why passenger jets were flying over the war zone three months after pilots were warned to avoid it in the east of the country eurocontrol which coordinates european air traffic control said ukrainian authorities had now closed all routes eurocontrol said the closure of airspace would affect 300 flights per day on the busy route with planes expected to be diverted delays are expected as a result aviation safety authorities in america and europe warned pilots in april about potential risks flying in or near ukraine airspace advertisement but before the mh17 crash security concerns closed ukrainian airspace the us federal aviation administration issued a special notice regarding ukrainian airspace advising airlines to exercise extreme caution due to the continuing potential for instability and eurocontrol warned pilots and airlines to avoid ukranian airspace due to serious risks aviation experts last night said operators continued to fly across the zone because it was the quickest and cheapest route for some flights brian flynn a spokesman for eurocontrol which directs air traffic across europe said ukrainian aviation authorities had closed the airspace below 32000 feet on monday after having earlier restricted the airspace below 26000 feet on july 1 in both cases the closures came as a result of security concerns after rebels shot down ukrainian military aircraft mr flynn said it is up to the ukrainian government to decide whether and how to restrict airspace with eurocontrol responsible for helping to implement those decisions p before the crash 300 commercial aircraft a day were flying through eastern ukrainian airspace with most serving as longhaul flights between europe and southeast asia mr flynn said such flights typically cruise at between 33000 and 37000 feet qantas said on friday it had shifted the flight path for its london to dubai route over ukraine some 400 nautical miles to the south several months ago a qantas spokesman declined to comment on the reasons for the shift which came amid heightened tensions between kiev and promoscow rebels mr flynn said airlines can elect to avoid an area even if its not closed but that he did not believe any had chosen to do so in eastern ukraine im not aware of any airlines that were specifically avoiding that area he said norman shanks a former head of group security at airports group baa said malaysia airlines like a number of other carriers has been continuing to use it because it is a shorter route which means less fuel and therefore less money attacks on aircraft in the area have been rife in the past week alone two ukrainian military aircraft were shot down and a third was damaged by a missile immediately after the crash yesterday four more airliners followed the same path and did not reroute they were flights for singapore airlines emirates kazakhstan airlines and etihad last night a department for transport spokesman confirmed that flights including those already airborne were being routed around the region virgin atlantic said it had diverted a small number of flights believed to include routes from heathrow to dubai and one on the mumbai to heathrow route turkish airlines said all of its flights would now avoid ukrainian airspace british airways said only one flight a day used that airspace the heathrow to kiev service a spokesman said the safety and security of our customers is always our top priority we are keeping those services under review but kiev is several hundred kilometres from the incident site other operators that were diverting flights over ukraine last night were italys alitalia lufthansa air france and the russian carriers aeroflot and transaero it is understood airliners continued to cross volatile regions because operators believed they were at a sufficient altitude not to be at risk of attack it was for this reason that commercial airliners continued to fly over iraq and afghanistan during prior conflicts although it has been reported that the us federal aviation administration has recently told carriers to avoid the crimea the malaysian airlines flight was reportedly travelling at an altitude of about 33000ft an altitude considered by those within the industry to be completely safe military jets typically fly at much lower altitudes meaning it would be hard to misinterpret an airliner at such height as a threat and many groundbased weapons would not reach such an altitude on monday a ukrainian military transport plane carrying eight people was hit by a missile fired from russian territory killing two of those on board on wednesday a ukrainian air force su25 fighter was also hit by a missile forcing the pilot to eject earlier that day another su25 was hit by a rebel missile but the pilot landed the plane successfully with relatively slight damage an industry source said the belief was that a plane could not be shot down at that altitude which is why aircraft continue to fly over zones that have wars going on david kaminskimorrow the air transport editor of flightglobal magazine added any decision about the opening or closing of ukrainian airspace will be a matter for the ukrainians it could well be that all of that airspace will now be closed bright day champion joined 17 apr 2014 location vic status offline points 2134 post options thanks0 quote reply posted 18 jul

reuters on the ground this plane was found crashed in ukraine near the russian border debris found over 10km away from the site the malaysian prime minister expressed his shock and ordered an investigation right away the malaysian foreign ministry is currently working closely with the russian and ukrainian governments flight tracker 24 shows the flight stopped in ukraine ukraine president terrorism or maybe russia the president of ukraine has immediately ordered a thorough investigation into the incident the president also claimed that the malaysian airline plane crash was a terrorist act sources from the ukrainian interior ministry has claimed that the flight was shot down by a buk groundtoair missile system if this is true there is a possibility of state military involvement however the associated press is reporting that prorussian rebels in ukraine do have the buk missile system on the other hand the foreign ministry of ukraine said that it would present evidence that russia was involved in the crash separatists denied everything prorussian separatists who have been fighting the ukrainian military in the region denied everything explaining that they do not have the capacity to shoot malaysian airline mh 17 down as mh 17 was most likely at an altitude of over 10000m before it went down the only kind of weaponry from the ground with the required capability would be of high military grade and sophistication in a quick telephone interview one of leader of the separatists group claimed that they only have weapons which can shoot up to 4000m but not any higher we dont have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height according to moscow times the leader of the separatist group in eastern ukraine igor strelkov announced that just 90 minutes before the news broke about mh17 his group shot down an an26 military transport aircraft after the news about the plane crash broke strelkov added that the malaysian airliner was downed by a ukrainian fighter jet the airspace of the donetsk and luhansk regions has been closed by the ukrainian government russia denies involvement at the united nations headquarters in new york after being accused by the ukrainian ambassador to the united nations the russian ambassador to the united nations claimed that we didnt do it russian officials announced that malaysian airline mh17 did not at any time enter russian airspace before it crashed the kremlin made a quick statement hours after the news broke vladimir putin has expressed his deepest condolences to prime minister najib razak of malaysia with regard to the accident in ukrainian territory of a malaysian airlines passenger aircraft resulting in numerous casualties the russian head of state asked him to convey his sincerest words of sympathy and support to families and friends of the victims president putins spokesman has called allegations from ukraine that russia was involved in the downing of mh17 stupidity other statements boeing our thoughts and prayers are with those on board mh17 as well as their families and loved ones we stand ready to provide assistance the dutch prime minister phoned the ukrainian president and delivered a message i am deeply shocked by the tragic news about the crash of flight mh17 of malaysian airlines from amsterdam to kuala lumpur over ukrainian territory united states president barack obama and russian president vladimir putin talked about the plane crash on the phone and us officials made this statement president obama spoke with russian president putin today about the situation in ukraine and the additional sanctions president obama also reiterated his concerns regarding the buildup of russian forces near the ukrainian border president obama called on president putin to take concrete steps to deescalate the situation including to press separatists to agree to a ceasefire support a roadmap for negotiations halt the flow of fighters and weapons into ukraine obtain the release of all hostages still held by the separatists and work to establish an effective osce bordermonitoring mechanism during the call president putin noted the early reports of a downed passenger jet near the russiaukraine border latest photo from the crash site so what now currently nothing much can be confirmed but british airways and lufthansa alongside a growing list of airline companies have declared that they will not be flying over ukraine for the time being the ukrainian government has just announced that 280 passengers and 15 crew members have died in the crash the permanent mission of the uk to the un has called for an emergency meeting in the un security council on the plane crash considering the political climate in the region especially when the conflict between the ukrainian military and prorussian separatists in eastern ukraine and the new sanctions imposed by the us and eu on russia the last thing the world needs right now is heightened tensions and unnecessary fingerpointing one of the flight recorders aka the black boxes have been found on the crash site investigators will be able to use this to figure out what happened the typewriter will continue to keep you informed

moscow for examination an advisor to the ukrainian interior minister anton gerashenko said the plane was hit by a missile fired from a buk launcher the associated press said one of its journalists saw a similar launcher near the eastern ukrainian town of snizhe earlier on thursday the buk antiaircraft missile system manufactured in russia can hit aircraft up to an altitude of 25km on june 29 the itartass news agency reported that donetsk peoples republic separatists had taken control of a missile defence unit equipped with buk missile systems however andrei purgin deputy prime minister of the donetsk peoples republic the insurgent group in eastern ukraine denied in a telephone interview that the rebels had anything to do with the loss of the passenger jet he said that the rebels had shot down ukrainian planes before but that their antiaircraft weapons could reach only to around 4000 metres far below the cruising level of passenger jets we dont have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height he said he said the plane apparently came down in an area of ukrainian military operations and that it was not out of the question that the ukrainians themselves shot it down according to an online flight tracking site the planes last known position was near donetsk at an altitude of just over 10km ukrainian prime minister areseny yatseniuk ordered an investigation into the airplane catastrophe in eastern ukraine his spokeswoman olga lappo said ukraines president petro poroshenko reportedly called it a terrorist act saying two ukraine warplanes had been shot down from russian

this terrible tragedy poroshenko thinks this of the plane that was brought down it is not an incident not a catastrophe but a terrorist act his press secretary svatoslav tsegolko said we are confident that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice he said within hours of the crash ukrainian media have reported blamed russianbacked cossack militants publishing what the kyiv post said was the content of a phone call between members of russianbacked militant groups intercepted by ukraines security agency the phone call was made 20 minutes after the plane crash the kyiv post reported by igor bezler military commander of the separatist donetsk peoples republic he was said to be reporting to a russian army colonel in their intelligence department in a transcript of the conversation bezler says we have just shot down a plane russian president vladimir putin issued a statement expressing his deepest condolences to the prime minister of malaysia with regard to the crash and asked him to convey his sincere sympathy and support to family and friends of the victims us president barack obama said it looked like a terrible tragedy and the us would offer any

of eastern ukraine controlled by prorussia separatists blown out of the sky at 33000 feet by what ukrainian and us officials described as a russianmade antiaircraft missile ukraine accused the separatists of carrying out what it called a terrorist attack us intelligence and military officials said the plane had been destroyed by a russian saseries missile based on surveillance satellite data that showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not its point of origin there were strong indications that those responsible may have errantly downed what they had thought was a military aircraft only to discover to their shock that they had struck a civilian airliner everyone aboard was killed their corpses littered among wreckage that was still smoldering late into the summer night russias president vladimir v putin blamed ukraines government for he said creating the conditions for the insurgency in eastern ukraine where separatists have bragged about shooting down at least three ukrainian military aircraft but putin did not specifically deny that a russianmade weapon had felled the malaysian jetliner whatever the cause the news of the crashed plane with a passenger manifest that spanned at least nine countries elevated the insurgency into a new international crisis the day before the us had slapped new sanctions on russia for its support of the prokremlin insurgency that has brought eastwest relations to their lowest point in many years making the crash even more of a shock it was the second time within months that malaysia airlines had suffered a masscasualty flight disaster with international intrigue and with the same model plane a boeing 777200er prime minister najib razak of malaysia whose government is still reeling from the unexplained disappearance of flight 370 in march somewhere over the indian ocean said he was stupefied at the news of flight 17 which had been bound for kuala lumpur from amsterdam with 283 passengers including three infants and 15 crew members aviation officials said the aircraft had been traveling an approved and heavily trafficked route over eastern ukraine about 20 miles from the russia border when it vanished from radar screens at 215 pm local time with no distress signal this is a tragic day in what has already been a tragic year for malaysia najib told reporters in a televised statement from kuala lumpur if it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice najib said he had spoken with the leaders of ukraine and the netherlands who promised their cooperation he also said that he had spoken with president barack obama and that he and i both agreed that the investigation must not be hindered in any way the remark pointed to concerns about evidence tampering at the crash site which is in an area controlled by prorussia insurgents obama and putin also spoke about the disaster and the broader ukraine crisis white house officials said and putin expressed his condolences to malaysia but in a statement quoted by russias ria novosti news agency putin said this tragedy would not have happened if there was peace in the country if military operations had not resumed in the southeast of ukraine adding to ukrainian and western suspicions that prorussia separatists were culpable ukraines intelligence agency the state security service known as the sbu released what it said was audio from intercepted phone calls between separatist rebels and russian military intelligence officers on thursday in the audio the separatists appeared to acknowledge shooting down a civilian plane the ukrainian foreign ministry sent reporters a link to the edited audio of the calls with english subtitles posted on youtube by the sbu according to a translation of the russian audio by the englishlanguage kyiv post the recording begins with a separatist commander identified as igor bezler telling a russian military intelligence official we have just shot down a plane in another call a man who seems to be at the scene of the crash says that a group of cossack militiamen shot down the plane he adds that it was a passenger plane and that the debris contains no sign of military equipment asked if there are any weapons he says absolutely nothing civilian items medical equipment towels toilet paper asked if there are any documents among the debris the man says yes of one indonesian student myroslava petsa a ukrainian journalist in kiev said that the voices in the audio sounded shocked by what they found in the wreckage by thursday night us intelligence analysts were increasingly focused on a theory that rebels had used a russianmade sa11 surfacetoair missile system and operated on their own firecontrol radar outside the checks and balances of the national ukrainian airdefense network to shoot down the aircraft everything we have and it is not much says separatists a senior pentagon official said that said theres still a lot of conjecture russian troops who have been deployed along the eastern ukraine border have similar sa11 systems as well as larger weapons known as sa20s pentagon officials said petro o poroshenko ukraines president said he had called the dutch prime minister mark rutte to express his condolences and to invite dutch experts to assist in the investigation i would like to note that we are calling this not an incident not a catastrophe but a terrorist act poroshenko said reporters arriving at the scene near the town of grabovo described dozens of lifeless bodies strewn about many intact in a field dotted with purple flowers and remnants of the plane scattered across a road lined with fire engines and emergency vehicles it fell down in pieces one rescue worker said as tents were set up to gather the dead the carcass of the plane was still smoldering and rescue workers moved through the dark field with flashlights for months eastern ukraine has been the scene of a violent prorussia separatist uprising rebels have claimed responsibility for attacking a ukrainian military jet as it landed in the city of luhansk on june 14 and for felling an an26 transport plane on monday and an su25 jet fighter on wednesday but this would be the first commercial airline disaster to result from the hostilities despite the turmoil the commercial airspace over eastern ukraine is heavily trafficked and has remained open questions are likely to be raised in the coming days about why the traffic line which is controlled by ukraine and russia was not closed earlier with the news of the disaster on thursday the ukrainian authorities declared the eastern part of the country a nofly zone us and european carriers rerouted their flights and aeroflot russias national carrier announced that it had suspended all flights to ukraine for at least three days the conspicuous exception was aeroflot flights to crimea the southern peninsula annexed by russia in march a pivotal point in the ukraine crisis it was unclear late thursday whether any americans had been aboard the flight russias interfax news agency said there had been no russians aboard in amsterdam a malaysia airlines official huib gorter said the plane had carried 154 dutch passengers 27 australians 45 malaysians including the crew 12 indonesians nine britons four germans four belgians three filipinos and one canadian the rest of the passengers had not been identified andrei purgin deputy prime minister of the donetsk peoples republic an insurgent group in eastern ukraine denied in a telephone interview that the rebels had anything to do with the loss of the jet he said that the rebels had shot down ukrainian planes before but that their antiaircraft weapons could reach only to around 4000 meters far below the cruising level of passenger jets we dont have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height purgin said he also did not rule out the possibility that ukrainian forces themselves had shot down the plane remember the black sea plane disaster he said referring to the 2001 crash of a siberian airlines passenger jet bound for novosibirsk from tel aviv that the ukrainians shot down by accident during a military training exercise in comments broadcast on ukrainian television vitali klitschko the mayor of kiev and a former heavyweight boxing champion said the crash illustrated the risks to peace in europe of the fighting in eastern ukraine this is not just a local conflict in donetsk and luhansk but a fullscale war in the center of europe he said im certain the international community this time will pay attention and understand",

referring to the downed plane she said it was a flight from amsterdam to kuala lumpur over european territory there should be outrage in european capitals fox news july 17 2014 lawmakers say there will be hell to pay if russia is behind malaysia airlines crash the white house confirmed thursday that president obama and russian president vladimir putin briefly discussed a malaysian passenger plane crash that killed 295 people on board during a telephone call the two leaders had earlier in the day white house spokesman josh earnest confirmed the call took place but suggested that putin did not pass on a lot of details to obama what putin passed on – or did not pass on to the president may be significant as more information comes out on possible russian involvement note the conclusion drawn is by fox editors sen john mccain rariz took a similar tone he said there would be hell to pay if the plane was shot down by the russian military – but added to leap to conclusions could be very embarrassing and really inappropriate until we have more information rep adam schiff dcalif added its been clear from the beginning that notwithstanding putins duplicitous statements to the contrary russia has continued tostoke theconflictand allow violent separatists in eastern ukraine access to an array of russian armaments ukrainian president petro poroshenko confirmed the crash and fueled speculation that the plane was shot down by separatists but state department spokesman jen psaki in a message on twitter said the us government can not confirm any cause we do not exclude that this plane was shot down poroshenko said and we stress that the armed forces of ukraine did not take action against any airborne targets fox news july 17 2014 malaysia airlines jet shot down three possible scenarios and their implications for russia and ukraine fox news offered three possible scenarios underlining by author 1 the ukrainian government had the opportunity but not the motive 2 prorussian rebel separatists in eastern ukraine may have the opportunity and perhaps the motive 3 russia has the opportunity but not the motive fox writer kt mcfarland concludes if it turns out russia has come out of the shadows and did shoot down the malaysian civilian aircraft it is a game changer the russians will try to deny it but no one will believe them even if it is russias proxies in eastern ukraine who are responsible for this terrible act russia loses plausible deniability it will be putins biggest nightmare because it could light a fire under european and american leaders to take immediate and severe action against russia washington post headlines july 17 2014 11pm et kiev accuses prorussian rebels of an act of terror ukraine claims video shows rebels talking about strike washington post july 17 2014 836pm et act could escalate tension between russia and west world leaders including among us allies in europe that have seen the conflict as a regional one and been reluctant to turn on moscow could be forced to reassess their position said damon wilson an expert on ukraine at the atlantic council and who worked on european policy at the white house between 2007 and 2009 its pretty difficult to continue playing that game if you have clear russian fingerprints on the shooting down of a civilian airliner he said the united states and its allies were hesitant to quickly assign blame and there was no overt suggestion that a civilian aircraft had been intentionally targeted but there was a clear undercurrent in the western response that the separatists were believed to be responsible new york times editorial from the editorial board july 17 2014 vladimir putin can stop this war downing of malaysia jet is a call to end ukraine conflict the ukrainian conflict has gone on far too long and it has become far too dangerous there is one man who can stop it — president vladimir putin of russia by telling the russianbacked separatists in eastern ukraine to end their insurgency and by stopping the flow of money and heavy weaponry to those groups but for all his mollifying words and gestures mr putin has only continued to stoke the flames by failing to shut down those pipelines failing to support a ceasefire and avoiding serious internationally mediated negotiations president obama was fully justified in announcing tough new sanctions the european union imposed its own lessstringent measures the russian leaders prefer not to accept that the cia did not engineer the preference of many ukrainians for what they see in the west they prefer to proclaim that russia is the victim of american designs and manipulation — a claim mr putin invoked again in response to the sanctions the new sanctions from washington which target some of russias largest energy companies and banks and more of its senior officials are not likely to change mr putins mind but they along with lesser but still significant european sanctions should make clear to him that the west will not back down note the outofplace exoneration of the cia in particular and emphasis on energy and banking new york times headline july 17 2014 1020 pm et jetliner explodes over ukraine struck by missile officials say new york times a malaysia airlines boeing 777 with 298 people aboard was shot down by a surfacetoair missile american officials said the furiously unfolding investigation is centering on ukrainian separatists or russian troops as the missile operators american intelligence and military officials said the plane had been destroyed by a russian saseries missile based on surveillance satellite data that showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not its point of origin russias president vladimir v putin blamed ukraines government for creating what he called conditions for insurgency in eastern ukraine where separatists have bragged about shooting down at least three ukrainian military aircraft but mr putin did not specifically deny that a russianmade weapon had felled the malaysian jetliner reuters us july 18 2014 1208 am et international probe demanded after malaysian airliner downed over ukraine 298 dead one us official said washington strongly suspected a surfacetoair missile that downed the malaysia airlines boeing 777 on a flight from amsterdam to kuala lumpur on thursday was fired by ukrainian separatists backed by moscow there was no evidence ukrainian government forces fired a missile said the official speaking on condition of anonymity australian prime minister tony abbott appeared to go further than other western leaders in apportioning blame demanding on friday that moscow answer questions about the russianbacked rebels that he said were behind the disaster ukrainian president petro poroshenko who had stepped up an offensive in the east spoke to obama and sought to rally world opinion behind his cause the external aggression against ukraine is not just our problem but a threat to european and global security he said in a statement russia which western powers accuse of trying to destabilize ukraine to maintain influence over its old soviet empire has accused kievs leaders of mounting a fascist coup it says it is holding troops in readiness to protect russianspeakers in the east the same rationale it used for taking over crimea as word came in of what might be the worst ever attack on a civilian airliner obama was on the phone with putin discussing a new round of economic sanctions that washington and its allies have imposed to try to force putin to do more to curb the revolt against the new government in kiev obama warned of further sanctions if moscow did not change course in ukraine the white house said how russia media reported the story rianovosti july 17 2014 donetsk militia leader blames ukraine for downing malaysia boeing the leader of the selfproclaimed donetsk peoples republic in eastern ukraine has traded accusations with kiev saying it was responsible for downing the malaysian airliner since local militia doesnt have the required technologies i think its all crystal clear the militia has only manpads portable air defense systems and missile systems their fire range is only at 23 kilometers so it was either ukrainian aviation or antimissile defense donetsk peoples republic dpr leader alexander borodai said rianovosti july 17 2014 russia says

russian president vladimir putin has put responsibility for the crash of a malaysian airlines boeing that took place on thursday on ukraine obviously the state over which this incident took place is

forces for the boeing crash dpr government offers condolences over malaysian airliner crash rt july 17 2014 kiev deployed powerful antiair systems to e ukraine ahead of the malaysian plane crash the ukrainian military has several batteries of buk surfacetoair missile systems with at least 27 launchers capable of bringing down highflying jets in the donetsk region where the malaysian passenger plane crashed russian defense ministry said according to the russian defense ministry information units of the armed forces of ukraine located in the crashsite are equipped with antiaircraft missile systems of bukm1 these complexes in their tactical and technical characteristics are capable of detecting air targets at ranges of up to 160 kilometers and hit them at full altitude range at a

later on thursday july 17 united nations secretary general ban kimoon called for a comprehensive and transparent international probe into the crash of the malaysian airlines boeing over ukraine he

7 2014 another malaysia airlines flight saw tragedy losing 227 passengers flying from kuala lumpur to beijing coincidence let us remember that the 6th brics summit was held in brazil on the day following the end of the world cup july 14 ending a day before this current tragedy july 16 coincidence a brics monetary stabilization fund and development bank were initiated to counter the dominance of imf world bank and western financial institutions more so it served notice that the global shift to a multipolar world at least financially was occurring let us remember that american news editors created manfactured and incited war fever against russia beginning with the fall of ukraine to maiden and right sector forces and today are fanning fires that can lead to world war clearly america is threatened financially broken from its constitutional mooring acting behind the backs of a sleeping populace seeking to dominate energy resources and transmission channels surgestyle wherever and whenever it can but whether it will be the asian century or the brics century the near future will be a multipolar world and no amount of us nuclear arsenals invasions occupations drone killings assassinations puppet governments provocation of russia and china sanctions cyber totalitarianism or militarizing proxy nations will ever stop the rotation of our planet multipolar is upon us dear

ukraine controlled by prorussia separatists blown out of the sky at 33000 feet by what ukrainian and us officials described as a russian made antiaircraft missile ukraine accused the separatists of carrying out what it called a terrorist attack us intelligence and military officials said the plane was destroyed by a russian saseries missile based on surveillance satellite data that showed the final trajectory and impact of the missile but not its origin vice president joe biden said the incident was not an accident and described the malaysia airlines plane as having been blown out of the sky there were strong indications that those responsible may have downed what they had thought was a military aircraft only to discover to their shock that they had struck a civilian airliner all 298 people aboard were killed their corpses littered among wreckage still smoldering late into the night russias president vladimir putin blamed ukraines government for he said creating the conditions for the insurgency in eastern ukraine where separatists have bragged about shooting down at least three ukrainian military aircraft but putin did not specifically deny that a russianmade weapon had felled the malaysia airlines jetliner en route from amsterdam to kuala lumpur malaysian prime minister najib razak said he had spoken with the leaders of ukraine and the netherlands who vowed their cooperation he also said that he had spoken with president barack obama and that he and i both agreed that the investigation must not be hindered in any way the remark pointed to concerns about evidence tampering at the site which is in an area controlled by prorussia insurgents obama and putin also spoke about the disaster and the broader ukraine crisis white house officials said and putin expressed his condolences to malaysia but in a statement quoted by russias ria novosti news agency putin said this tragedy would not have happened if there was peace in the country if military operations had not resumed in the southeast of ukraine adding to ukrainian and western suspicions that pro russia separatists were culpable ukraines intelligence agency the state security service known as the sbu released what it said was audio from intercepted calls between separatists and russian military intelligence officers on thursday in the audio the separatists appeared to acknowledge shooting down a civilian plane the ukrainian foreign ministry sent reporters a link to the edited audio of the calls with english subtitles posted on youtube by the sbu according to a translation of the russian audio by the english language kyiv post the recording begins with a separatist commander telling a russian military intelligence official we have just shot down a plane in another call a man who seems to be at the scene says a group of cossack militiamen shot down the plane he adds that it was a passenger plane and that the debris contains no sign of military equipment asked if there are any weapons he says absolutely nothing civilian items medical equipment towels toilet paper asked if there were any documents the man says yes of one indonesian student myroslava petsa a ukrainian journalist in kiev said the voices in the audio sounded shocked by what they had found ukrainian officials also noted that at about the same time igor strelkov a prorussia separatist leader bragged on v kontakte a russian version of facebook that his men had shot down what he thought was a ukrainian military transport plane its tumbling down near the progress mine he wrote in the post we told them not to fly in our skies by thursday night us intelligence analysts were increasingly focused on a theory that rebels had used a russianmade sa11 buk surfacetoair missile system and operated on their own firecontrol radar — outside the checks and balances of the national ukrainian airdefense network everything we have and it is not much says separatists a senior pentagon official said that said theres still a lot of conjecture russian troops who have been deployed along the eastern ukraine border have similar sa11 systems as well as larger weapons known as sa20s pentagon officials said petro poroshenko ukraines president said he had called the dutch prime minister mark rutte to express his condolences and to invite dutch experts to assist in the investigation i would like to note that we are calling this not an incident not a catastrophe but a terrorist act poroshenko said andrei purgin deputy prime minister of the donetsk peoples republic an insurgent group in eastern ukraine denied in a phone interview that the rebels had any role he said the rebels had shot down ukrainian planes before but their antiaircraft weapons could reach only to around 4000 meters far below a passenger jets cruising level we dont have the technical ability to hit a plane at that height purgin said he also did not rule out the possibility that ukrainian forces themselves had shot down the plane this
