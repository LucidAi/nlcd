            "text": "Edelman, America’s biggest public relations firm, has for the first time formally declared it will not take on campaigns that deny global warming, in response to an investigation by the Guardian.\n\nHowever it is unclear on its commitment to existing clients that have been involved in spreading doubt aboutand fighting regulations to cut carbon pollution.The explicit rejection comes in response to a story earlier this week that saw a number of top firms in the industry – but not– declare as a matter of company policy that they viewed climate change as a threat, and that they would not take on clients or campaigns that deny climate change.In an apparent damage control exercise, the PR firm alerted the Guardian to what may be the industry’s first official position on climate denial.A statement on its website reads: \"Edelman fully recognises the reality of, and science behind, climate change, and believes it represents one of the most important global challenges facing society, business and government today. To be clear, we do not accept client assignments that aim to deny climate change.\"Michael Bush, a spokesman for Edelman, expressed regret for the company’s earlier response. \"Unfortunately, that position was not fully shared … when [the Guardian] initially reached out to us.\"Edelman and other top PR firms earn millions every year crafting messages and campaigns surrounding climate change. Edelman reportedly had earnings of $747 million last year, and has represented the powerful oil industry lobby, the American Petroleum Institute (API), as well as conservative groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), that oppose Barack Obama’s environmental agenda.After other industry leaders such as WPP and Weber Shandwick came out against climate deniers, an Edelman executive, Ben Boyd, told a Chicago radio programme: \"we do not work for deniers\". Boyd also said the company would \"scrub, on a daily basis, our client roster and look at the behaviours of our clients\".The commitment was a departure for Edelman, which earlier told the Guardian it took on clients on a case-by-case basis.\"Expanding the dialogue in a constructive manner, and driving productive outcomes to solve energy challenges are the key criteria for evaluating client engagements,\" Bush added in an email.Edelman had also been reluctant to respond to an earlier survey by the Climate Investigations Centre, inadvertently emailing researchers: \"There are only wrong answers to this guy\".Kert Davies, the founder of Climate Investigations, said the Edelman’s position was an important shift. \"Edelman’s position on climate change before this statement was at best opaque. Now they might be the first big PR firm to actually have a published 'position’ on climate change and rejecting climate science denial,\" he wrote in an email. \"This is a big step … and it might pull the rest of the industry along to take a firm stance on climate change.\"However, Edelman still left itself room for manoeuvre. Bush later backpedalled on Boyd’s commitment to \"scrub\" the client roster, writing in an email: \"We did not intend to suggest that we have launched a 'scrubbing’ operation of our client roster, but that we continually look at our client portfolio. As you might imagine with thousands of clients it’s an ongoing exercise.\"He also declined to say whether Edelman had let go or \"scrubbed\" clients – such as API and Alec that have been involved in spreading doubt about climate change and fighting regulations to cut carbon pollution.Edelman has a rigorous in-house carbon accounting system. In a blogpost last month, its chief executive, Richard Edelman, wrote that business should be involved in seeking market solutions to climate change and expressed concern that some 40 per cent of Americans believe that humans are not changing the climate. \"There is a significant failure of communications regarding the environment,\" Edelman wrote.API has lobbied hard to expand oil and gas drilling, and speed construction of the Keystone XL pipeline from the Alberta tar sands. A carefully crafted statement on the API website does not explicitly deny the science of global warming, but it does inject an element of doubt where there is none over the link between the burning of fossil fuels and climate change.\"While we rely on them for most of our energy and will likely do so for years to come, emissions from their production and use may be helping to warm our planet by enhancing the natural greenhouse effect of the atmosphere,\" API says on its website.Alec meanwhile has sought to roll back clean energy rules and tax homeowners who install solar panels.Or as Boyd told WBEZ in Chicago this week: \"We do not work for deniers, but we recognise that there is great nuance and grey in this conversation.\"",

the years in framing the debate on climate change and its solutions – as well as the extensive disinformation campaigns launched to block those initiatives now a number of the top 25 global pr firms

taking on a client or campaign disputing climate change would violate company guidelines we ensure that our own work complies with local laws marketing codes and our own code of business conduct these prevent advertising that is intended to mislead and the denial of climate change would fall into this category the company said however fiona mcewan a spokeswoman for the company said the 150 companies within wpp made their own decisions on clients and would not rule out campaigns opposing regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions the usbased edelman which is the worlds largest independently owned pr firm did not explicitly rule out taking on climate deniers as clients expanding the dialogue in a constructive manner and driving productive outcomes to solve energy challenges are the key criteria for evaluating client engagements said spokesman michael bush he said edelman takes on clients on a casebycase basis the pr firms were responding to surveys conducted independently by the guardian and the climate investigations centre a washingtonbased group that conducts research on climate disinformation campaigns this could have a knockon effect on the advertising and lobbying campaigns targeting barack obamas regulations limiting carbon emissions from power plants and the international negotiations for a climate change treaty now entering a critical phase the pr industry is a major component of the influence peddling industry that stretches across washington and the world and they are making large sums of money from energy companies and other important players that have businesses connected to fossil fuels and energy policy said kert davies the founder of climate investigations davies said his group took on the research to try to get a better grasp of the mechanics behind the framing of messages on climate change – and the disinformation campaign over the past few years environmental groups and scientists have been looking more closely at the messaging around climate change in part to examine their own failings to build broader public support for action in the process pr firms have grown even more influential in shaping the debate around climate policy said james hoggan who ran his own public relations firm in vancouver and founded desmogblog a blog that describes itself as clearing the pr pollution that clouds climate science i think that public relations people are right at the elbow of powerful people in industry and government he said you are an insider – a very trusted insider – and you can have a huge influence it really does matter these are influential organisations some of the firms such as finn partners have a strong reputation for taking on environmental causes finn partners would not work on

partner peter finn we said it had worked on campaigns to expand production tax credits for wind energy oglivy public relations told cic that it recognised the risks of climate change and that it had worked on campaigns for wwf and greenpeace but it declined to comment on whether it would represent clients that deny climate change qorvis a washington dcbased pr company and its parent company msl group also declined to answer that question other companies however appear concerned with trying to represent environmental campaign groups as well as industry according to davies only 10 of the 25 firms responded to multiple emails phone calls and certified letters from the cic either directly or through a parent company firms that refused to comment include those that have worked for groups calling for action on climate change – as well as those seeking to block those efforts hill knowlton for example was hired as the official media sponsor for the united nations climate conference in copenhagen in 2009 the company declined to respond to the cic survey several of the companies such as wpp we oglivy and edelman have ambitious inhouse programmes for reducing their carbon footprint qorvis communications a subsidiary of publicis groupe said it had been calculating its carbon footprint since 2009 but even those firms with robust internal carbon accounting systems such as edelman were reluctant to go on record edelmans client list includes the american petroleum institute the main energy lobby which opposes barack obamas climate change agenda edelman also carried out campaigns supporting the keystone xl pipeline a proposed pipeline to carry tar sands oil from canada to refineries on the gulf coast of texas an initial response to cic from edelman inadvertently included an internal email which said i dont believe we are obligated in any way to respond there are only wrong answers for this guy edelman did in the end respond to the cic and the guardian screengrab of edelman email conversation other firms said they had signed on to the united nations global compact on sustainable business however the compact does not explicitly commit companies to policies on climate change seven of the firms told the researchers their companies saw climate change as a threat but a smaller number would rule out taking on clients that deny climate change is occurring or work on campaigns that seek to block policies to deal with climate change for the majority of them they would rather remain neutral on any issue davies said they dont want to have positions on anything because they like to keep options open to take on any client who walks in the door they pretend they are above the fray and they are not involved and yet they are the ones designing ad campaigns designing lobbying campaigns and designing the messages their clients want to convey around climate change the climate investigations centre sent out surveys in april to the worlds top 25 firms asking them to go on the record about their views on climate change the short survey asked does your company acknowledge the threat and challenge of climate change as companies like walmart cocacola apple google aig swiss re nrg unilever and others have done does your company have any internal carbon accounting policies or energy use reduction targets have you taken actions to reduce your carbon footprint does your company have an internal corporate social responsibility csr policy regarding climate change or the environment generally has your agency advised any client corporations on communications around csr programmes with a specific climate change focus or on other climate change related public relations efforts the guardian followed up by asking firms if they would take on clients that deny the existence of manmade climate change or campaigns seeking to block regulations dealing with climate change",

Responding to a survey conducted by the Guardian and the Climate Investigations Center, ten of the world's top 25 PR firms told the Guardian they will not represent clients who were climate change deniers, or take on campaigns that were against issuing regulations limiting carbon pollution.The firms included, WPP, Waggener Edstrom (WE) Worldwide, Weber Shandwick, Text100, and Finn Partners, according to the Guardian. “We would not knowingly partner with a client who denies the existence of climate change,” said Rhian Rotz, spokesman for WE. Weber Shandwick went further, explaining their stand on campaigns that would block carbon emissions regulations and promoting renewable energy solutions.“We would not support a campaign that denies the existence and the threat posed by climate change, or efforts to obstruct regulations cutting greenhouse gas emissions and/or renewable energy standards,” Weber Shandwick spokeswoman Michelle Selesky said. “There may be scenarios in which we could represent a client that has different views on climate change, just not on this issue.”U.S.-based Edelman, the world's largest public relations company came close, but didn't say they wouldn't take on climate deniers as clients. “Expanding the dialogue in a constructive manner, and driving productive outcomes to solve energy challenges are the key criteria for evaluating client engagements,” said spokesman Michael Bush. Bush said they take on clients on a case-by-case basis.There was a reason behind tackling PR firms, because they are a silent partner helping large corporations to exert their influence through advertising campaigns. These campaigns are much bigger than putting an ad in the newspaper or on a billboard. Kert Davies, the founder of Climate Investigations says,The campaigns use complex online and social media platforms tied to policy objectives and lobbyists. Some PR companies even have lobbying services. There are many more firms out there, according to Davies, and some of them are unscrupulous in the way they run their campaigns. Davies singles-out one such company, Nichols-Dezenhall, now Dezenhall Resources. They dote on corporations or people in crisis, ready to advise them, for a very large fee.While public relations companies do their best to sway public opinion, for or against climate change, the Huffington Post reported that a Forum Research poll found 81 percent of Canadians accepted the reality of global warming, with 58 percent believing it was human-caused, and an Ipsos MORI found that 54 percent of Americans believed in human-caused climate change.The Huffington Post added an interesting observation, saying research shows that climate change denial is more prevalent in English-speaking countries, but that could be because of the political ideologies in English-speaking countries. The countries with the largest numbers of climate deniers are the U.S., Australia and the U.K. Canada is far down on the list.",

corporations on communications around csr programs with a specific climate change focus or on other climate change related public relations efforts yes edelman provides counsel to a range of clients across many industries including counsel on csr programs and on key issues such as climate change if you would like to discuss these answers or if i can be of further help to you i would welcome the chance to speak my mobile number is cheers ben boyd president practices sectors offerings edelman its been a crummy summer for the federal bureau of land management the bureau sells development leases to mining companies that want to scrape out coal deposits that lie under taxpayerowned dirt on federal land it has managed to draw fire from the interior departments inspector general the gao the nation and a halfdozen environmental groups the gripe is that by charging bargainbasement prices for its coal that is our coal blm is perhaps the most important player keeping the american coal industry alive while costing american taxpayers some 30 billion over thirty years according to a july report by center for american progress one important way blm undervalues american coal is by failing to take into account the vast markup domestic producers can reap by shipping the coal to asia europe or south america rather than trying to unload it on a shrinking american market where 150 coalfired power plants have already closed and new carbon limits are likely to make coal less and less economical according to a july report by the sightline institute as the american wing of big coal turns increasingly to exports to prop up whats left of its bottom line coal producers have come to depend on vast mineral reserves in the western united states particularly in the powder river basin in wyoming and montana that can be extracted cheaply via surface mining and shipped overseas almost all of this coal is found on federal lands where the bureau of land management is virtually giving its leases away according to several recent studies a july report by greenpeace leasing coal fueling climate change how the federal coal leasing program undermines president obamas climate plan goes several steps further than others pointing out that in addition to ignoring coals export value blm failed to consider carbon pollution impacts of between 52 billion and 553 million from coal leases issued during the obama administration and by making coal so cheap the bureau undercuts obamas own plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions which the adminstration is fighting for against intense opposition from republicans and the lobbying and financial might of the fossil fuel industry with companies looking to double americas coal exports the nations growing position in the global energy trade could make global warming worse fueling the worlds demand for coal when many experts say most fossil fuels should remain in the ground to avert the most disastrous effects of climate change noted the associated press in a recent story if the obamaites have missed it at least one federal judge sees the connection in june district court judge r brooke jackson blocked the expansion of a colorado mine scolding the administration for failing to use its own social cost of carbon figures to assess the expansions impact on global warming making matters worse is that bidding in the coal leasing program in the west is already rigged in favor of cheap leases this goes back to 1990 when president george hr bushs administration reversed decades of precedent and decided that the powder river basin was not a historic coal production region effectively ceding control over the lease program to big coal since then 96 of 107 western coallease sales held by blm have had only one bidder one study that documents coal sales at mines wyoming new mexico montana north dakota colorado and utah by some of the largest producers including peabody energy arch coal and cloud peak energy zeroed in on specific companies to expose the mechanics of what has become modern coals dominant business model the report entitled unfair market value by ignoring exports blm underprices federal coal was prepared by the sightline institute and four other environmental groups a case in point is cloud peaks spring creek mine in southern montana near the wyoming border most of the 18 million tons of coal cloud peak sold its asian customers in the last four years came from spring creek the company paid the federal government meaning us the taxpayers a maximum of 18 cents per ton for the coal which cloud peak resold on the asian market for more than 60 per ton for profits four to five times as high as the margins that cloud peak earned on domestic sales cloud peak like other western producers is pushing hard for the development of three new port or terminal facilities in washington and oregon such as the proposed gateway pacific terminal in bellingham washington which would connect by rail to its mines in montana and wyoming meanwhile as the struggle over the terminals plays out cloud peak is trying for another round of giveaways by bidding for an additional 198 million tons of coal deposits next to spring creek meanwhile local residents activists environmentalists and the democratic governors of oregon and washington are demanding that the administration consider the effect on global warming of building terminal facilities that would help double american coal exports so far the administration has flatly refused resources center for american progress federal coal leasing in

promoting fossil fuel exploitation for american petroleum institute vote4energy energy citizens or working for the american legislative exchange council whose recent meeting in dallas was loaded with climate denier presentations from heartland and cfact along with model bills aimed at undermining epa greenhouse gas regulations motherboard at vice dug in a little deeper on where the twain meet to be continued wbez afternoon shift august 5 2014 rough transcript niala boodhoo host youre listening to the afternoon shift im niala boodhoo the worlds most powerful public relations firms stake their business on having the ability to influence people and policy right well now it seems several top pr firms are taking a stand against climate change denial ten of the worlds largest public relations firms such as webershandwick and wpp thats the parent company of bursonmarsteller and ogilvy public relations say they will no longer do business with entities that reject the existence of climate change this is all because of a survey from the climate investigations center that was done with the uks guardian newspaper it tried to find out where the top pr houses stood on representing those who reject the science of climate change notably not on that list was chicagobased edelman public relations firm joining me to talk about why is edelmans ben boyd and kert davies the executive director of the climate investigations center gentlemen welcome to the afternoon shift kert davies cic thanks for having me ben boyd edelman pr thanks so much nb kert lets start with you whats the climate investigations center and why did you do this survey kd the climate investigations center is a relatively new organziation building on the work i did at greenpeace for thirteen years looking into the funding of climate science denial and organizations like the heartland institute there in chicago and exxons involvement in this the koch brothers involvement this organizations dedicated to researching and uncovering where the climate debate where the rubber meets the road so to speak so were digging into a variety of different things people can find out more at climateinvestigationsorg nb how many firms did you send this survey to kert kd we sent it to the top 25 firms operating in the us based on their revenue and uh its a lot of revenue nb and how many firms responded kd we only got responses from a few firms directly and then some punted to their parent organizations their parent companies thats wpp so in total we got direct responses from six firms and then we got indirect responses from another few its a mixed bag but we you know the response we accidentally got from edelman straight up was there are only wrong answers for this guy their ceo at the time who has now left the company accidentally emailed me so i think a lot of companies probably felt the same way we dont need to answer these questions and we think it was a pretty simple question do you acknowledge the threat of climate change nb well ben lets ask him uh lets ask you to respond to that do you want to answer that question if you bb i think look its really simple if i were kert id feel exactly the same way i mean the fact of the matter is that edelman fully recognizes the reality of and the science behind climate change and we do not accept client assignments that aim to deny climate change i think unfortunately and theres no excuse other than just poor communication which is probably ironic for a communications firm but you know junior staff handled the completion of the questionnaire it was not mark hass and again that email was completely unacceptable and inappropriate so you know i would begin by first clarifying that that is our position and i would also offer kert and the cic an apology for what was an inaccurate or rather incomplete answer to what i agree with him to be four very simple questions and i would also state unequivocally edelmans desire to work with him and the cic in terms of further investigation and engagement with our industry as outlined in his larger post of today nb ben you know you said that you dont accept client assignments that aim to as you said obstruct or dilute regulation designed to address climate change how does that square with your representation of say like the american petroleum institute thats one of your clients right bb yeah i think that the reality is you know this is we want to paint a lot of these debates as black and white right so if you look at the notion of ethanol and greenhouse gas emissions and the points of view around ethanol as an acceptable alternative the fact of the matter is that there are varying opinions so again we do not work for deniers but we recognize that there is great nuance and grey in this conversation and i think what we have espoused in terms of our own corporate view is the need for business and government to work together as it relates to these large societal complex issues and topics but again we fully accept and believe the science behind climate change and we do not work for clients who deny that nb kert kd well one of your clients is the american legislative exchange council which just held its meeting in dallas and i dont know if edelmans still working for them but were in 2012 when they ran into some protests from outside groups and alec just hosted this meeting with the heartland institute with this other group called cfact hardcore climate deniers who were instructing legislators on how to attack the epa how to question the science i dont know that you do that work with them nb ben do you still work with them bb id have to look at our client roster with you know thousands of clients on a varying school id be happy to look at that kert and connect back with you on that in terms of active engagement with them nb ben to kerts point do you i mean now that you i say you dont do that have you obviously youre such a large firm i cant even imagine how many clients you have do you have a process of going through and determining whether or not theyre people youll work with or wont work with them in terms of climate change bb i think we certainly have a policy which is available on our website its pretty black and white i think that policy is shared clearly internally and our client leaders are expected to uphold the values that we espouse as a firm and that we believe as a business as the right and ethical way to operate i can not guarantee to you guys or anyone else that in a firm of 6000 i wont have ethical lapses what i can guarantee you is that when ethical lapses when and if those lapses happen and those choices yaknow have consequences and we move on those but we do not consciously especially from a management perspective accept revenue from those who deny the science behind climate change nb kert let me ask you one last question which is ben was talking about the nuances of this did you hear other firms say that as well whats your position on this kd you know there was a broad range of responses to our survey very interesting stuff some firms were being pushed by their clients one firm engaged with ibm who said well whats your carbon footprint to the ad firm and they didnt have one they had to develop one to take the contract edelman has a whole carbon accounting program i didnt even know about because its in the appendix to their citizenship report theyre doing their own carbon footprint and have targets on airline miles reduction thats remarkable but as you said earlier it barely squares with a multimillion dollar contract to push oil push the keystone pipeline without mentioning potential carbon impacts its very easy in the ad industry to avoid subjects and to stress the positives nb well but kert to my question about did you find that pr firms or other firms you talked to are they saying no to these campaigns or are they saying no to firms that dont believe in climate change what are other firms telling you kd some committed we didnt really ask that question the guardian asked that question and they got commitments that they were not working with climate deniers and that is a major step forward its a question that frankly has never been put to this industry before the reason we did this survey was because pretty much every other sector has been questioned about climate change you take banking or insurance or yaknow the oil industry obviously all of them over the decades have been questioned do you believe in this do you think its a major push because we have to have the corporate community working alongside governments to solve this problem and the pr industrys just never been asked so i think its a work in progress getting the pr industry to wake up to the fact that they are important one commentator in an article said this is probably the biggest pr problem in the world getting people to understand climate change its a very hard thing to get done we need the help of the pr professionals to do that nb and kert now that ben uh ben now that kert has posed the question to you whats your response to how you think pr firms what responsibility do you think public relations firms and edelman has to this whole issue of climate change and climate change deniers bb yeah not a great question unequivocally i think we have stated that business has to play a role in solving these complex world problems i dont think that edelman or the pr industry is an exception to that uh assumption i think the work that we do around the trust barometer looks and points to the expectations of peoples around the world in 27 countries where we survey for business to be a responsible good actor with actually greater trust in business to lead change so again we do not work with those who deny the science i think we continue to scrub on a daily basis our client roster and look at the behaviors of our clients even outside the assignments that we have and i think our commitment as he outlined in terms of our own carbon footprint and presence is something that we proactively began our work with unilever again is a demonstration of a partnership in which we look at how to help raise larger conversations in the public sphere that are important around the topics of sustainability and corporate behavior that has been you know a bold proclamation of our ceo in terms of what is necessary for business to be successful in the long term and again we are not in any way immune from that belief nb well thank you so much both of you for joining me thats ben boyd the global chair of corporate practices for edelman based of course here in chicago and kert davies the executive director of the climate investigations center thank you kd thank you bb thanks very much i dont believe we are obligated in any way to respond there are only wrong answers for this guy that was the first response we got to our survey email accidentally copied back to us by no less than the then ceo of edelman the very largest pr firm in the world an article by suzanne goldenberg of the guardian broke the news of the survey we sent to the top us pr agencies in april ari phillips of climate progress then extended the story much more to come this opens a new cic project on the the public relations industry and climate where we will be conducting research on the pr industry role in the climate change debate not a new subject but not one that has really been tackled well we recently revealed with huffington post that bursonmarsteller was secretly behind the latest public relations ploy by peabody energy corporation aka peabody coal the largest coal company on earth two years ago greenpeace dug into the history of advertising by the coal industrial complex including aep and others as shown in this huffingtonpost slideshow and this new article by rebecca leber of the new republic after the burson peabody story we wondered if the multibillion dollar public relations industry has a climate conscience or even climate consciousness every other business sector has been ask to go on the record about climate change it seemed no one had ever asked the multibillion dollar pr industry so we asked them we sent a short survey to the top 25 public relations agencies in the united states ranked by fee income according to the industry journal the holmes report as the beginning of phase two of our survey we added the brunswick group to the query list we emailed sent certified mail and phoned presidents ceos general counsels sustainability officers and as many high ranking officials as we could locate email mailing addresses and phone numbers we asked four simple questions about the agencies work vis a vis climate change does your company acknowledge the threat and challenge of climate change as companies like walmart cocacola apple google aig swiss re nrg unilever and others have done does your company have any internal carbon accounting policies or energy use reduction targets have you taken actions to reduce your carbon footprint does your company have an internal corporate social responsibility csr policy regarding climate change or the environment generally has your agency advised any client corporations on communications around csr programs with a specific climate change focus or on other climate change related public relations efforts the pr agencies surveyed all together the 25 firms included in our survey thus far plus msl group which answered the survey for the newly acquired asset qorvis

wpp interpublic group of companies ipg next fifteen communications group nfc the omnicom group omc i got the idea for this inaugural column for climate investigations when the business publication snl

snl was able to pry loose from the companies id succeed in getting at least a couple of ontherecord phone interviews with big coal like snl i asked basic questions of the ten leading coal producers do you believe in global warming is human activity partly or wholly to blame and what role has coal played in what is generally acknowledged to be a global emergency there have long been industries whose existence was largely premised on a product whose deleterious effects far outweighed any good it did the world or its people there was asbestos an industry that learned in the twenties and thirties that the minerals microscopic fibers caused cancer and an incapacitating scarring of the lungs but pretended otherwise to the eleven million workers who mined manufactured or installed it then there was lead which the industry falsely claimed needed to be in gasoline and paint long after serious health impacts were known the cigarette companies seemed to be in a class by themselves a handful of firms employing no more than a few thousand turning out a product that took more lives than the combined toll of all the wars of the 20th century and since after more than ten years reporting on big tobacco i was certain id never the see its equal for the chasm between its reason for being and any reasonable definition of the common good but though this is my first column for climate investigations coal already has a distinctly familiar feel the cigarette companies were famously hostile to reporters but at least theyd call you back not so big coal over a period of three weeks the

We hold ourselves accountable to reduce our carbon footprint at every Edelman office around the world.\n\nWe believe that business, government and society must work together to address climate change by balancing the interdependent priorities of human development, the environment and the global economy. As such, we support our clients’ efforts to reduce emissions from their operations, improve energy efficiency, advance alternative fuels and sustainable energy solutions and lead in the transition to sustainable and socially responsible business models. We also work with clients to constructively participate in the dialogue around climate change and contribute to policy discussions, with the goal of making progress on this shared global challenge.\n\nYes. Edelman fully recognizes the reality of, and science behind, climate change, and believes it represents one of the most important global challenges facing society, business and government today. To be clear, we do not accept client assignments that aim to deny climate change.\n\nWhile we have certainly passed your deadline, I would like to resubmit our answer to the CIC Survey for your consideration:\n\nAs I conveyed on-air, you have my apology that your initial request for answers to your survey was so mismanaged by our firm.  Completely unacceptable.\n\nI appreciated the opportunity to connect with you yesterday on the WBEZ program regarding your survey and The Guardian piece.  As you can imagine, we welcomed the chance to clarify our position and also appreciated today’s update by The Guardian, including your statement.\n\nOut of fairness, we invite all the companies we surveyed to re-submit their own more complete answers as well.\n\nEdelman took the opportunity to rewrite its answers to our April climate survey this week.  This after giving CIC one line somewhat incomplete answers to our April survey and after the now ex-CEO told his staff they need not respond to our four (quite straightforward) questions and also told them, \"there are only wrong answers for this guy\".\n\nof Oregon and Washington are demanding that the administration consider the effect on global warming of building terminal facilities that would help double American coal exports.\n\nCloud Peak, like other western producers, is pushing hard for the development of three new port or terminal facilities in Washington and Oregon, such as the proposed Gateway Pacific Terminal in Bellingham, Washington, which would connect by rail to its mines in Montana and Wyoming.  Meanwhile, as the struggle over the terminals plays out, Cloud Peak is trying for another round of giveaways, by bidding for an additional 198 million tons of coal deposits next to Spring Creek.\n\nMost of the 18 million tons of coal Cloud Peak sold its Asian customers in the last four years came from Spring Creek.  The company paid the federal government - meaning us, the taxpayers - a maximum of 18 cents per ton for the coal, which Cloud Peak resold on the Asian market for more than $60 per ton for profits \"four to five times as high as the margins that Cloud Peak earned on domestic sales.\"\n\nOne study that documents coal sales at mines Wyoming, New Mexico, Montana, North Dakota, Colorado and Utah by some of the largest producers, including Peabody Energy, Arch Coal and Cloud Peak Energy zeroed in on specific companies to expose the mechanics of what has become modern coal's dominant business model.\n\nMaking matters worse is that bidding in the coal leasing program in the west   is already rigged in favor of cheap leases .  This goes back to 1990, when President George H.R. Bush's administration reversed decades of precedent and decided that the Powder River Basin was not a \"historic coal production region,\" effectively ceding control over the lease program to Big Coal.  Since then, 96 of 107 western coal-lease sales held by BLM have had only one bidder.\n\nIn June, district court Judge R. Brooke Jackson blocked the expansion of a Colorado mine, scolding the administration for failing to use its own social cost of carbon figures to assess the expansion's impact on global warming.\n\n\"With companies looking to double America’s coal exports, the nation’s growing position in the global energy trade could make global warming worse, fueling the world’s demand for coal when many experts say most fossil fuels should remain in the ground to avert the most disastrous effects of climate change,\" noted the Associated Press in a recent story.\n\nA July  report by Greenpeace - \"Leasing Coal, Fueling Climate Change: How the Federal Coal Leasing Program Undermines President Obama's Climate Plan\" - goes several steps further than others, pointing out that in addition to ignoring coal's export value,  BLM failed to consider carbon pollution impacts of between $52 billion and $553 million from coal leases issued during the Obama administration.  And by making coal so cheap, the bureau undercuts Obama's own plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions which the adminstration is fighting for against intense opposition from Republicans and the lobbying and financial might of the fossil fuel industry.\n\nAs the American wing of Big Coal turns increasingly to exports to prop up what's left of its bottom line, coal producers have come to depend on vast mineral reserves in the western United States, particularly in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana, that can be extracted cheaply via surface mining and shipped overseas.

I'm Niala Boodhoo. The world's most powerful public relations firms stake their business on having the ability to influence people and policy, right? Well, now it seems several top PR firms are taking a stand against climate change denial. Ten of the world's largest public relations firms, such as Weber-Shandwick and WPP - that's the parent company of Burson-Marsteller and Ogilvy Public Relations - say they will no longer do business with entities that reject the existence of climate change. This is all because of a survey from the Climate Investigations Center that was done with the UK's Guardian newspaper. It tried to find out where the top PR houses stood on representing those who reject the science of climate change. Notably not on that list was Chicago-based Edelman Public Relations Firm. Joining me to talk about why is Edelman's Ben Boyd and Kert Davies, the executive director of the Climate Investigations Center. Gentlemen, welcome to the afternoon shift.\n\nKert Davies, CIC: Thanks for having me.\n\nBen Boyd, Edelman PR: Thanks so much.\n\nNB: Kert, let's start with you. What's the Climate Investigations Center and why did you do this survey?\n\nKD: The Climate Investigations Center is a relatively new organziation building on the work I did at Greenpeace for thirteen years, looking into the funding of climate science denial and organizations like the Heartland Institute there in Chicago, and Exxon's involvement in this, the Koch brother's involvement. This organization's dedicated to researching and uncovering where the climate debate - where the rubber meets the road, so to speak. So we're digging into a variety of different things. People can find out more at ClimateInvestigations.org.\n\nNB: How many firms did you send this survey to, Kert?\n\nKD: We sent it to the top 25 firms operating in the US based on their revenue and, uh, it's a lot of revenue.\n\nNB: And how many firms responded?\n\nKD: We only got responses from a few firms directly, and then some punted to their parent organizations, their parent companies - that's WPP. So, in total, we got direct responses from six [firms] and then we got indirect responses from another few. It's a mixed bag, but we, you know - the response we accidentally got from Edelman, straight up, was \"there are only wrong answers for this guy.\" Their CEO at the time, who has now left the company, accidentally emailed me. So, I think a lot of companies probably felt the same way - we don't need to answer these questions. And we think it was a pretty simple question: \"do you acknowledge the threat of climate change?\"\n\nNB: Well, Ben, let's ask him - uh, let's ask you to respond to that. Do you want to answer that question? If you -\n\nBB: I think, look, it's really simple. If I were Kert, I'd feel exactly the same way. I mean, the fact of the matter is that Edelman fully recognizes the reality of and the science behind climate change. And we do not accept client assignments that aim to deny climate change. I think, unfortunately - and there's no excuse other than just poor communication, which is probably ironic for a communications firm - but, you know, junior staff handled the completion of the questionnaire. It was not Mark Hass. And, again, that email was completely unacceptable and inappropriate. So, you know, I would begin by first clarifying that that is our position and I would also offer Kert and the CIC an apology for what was an inaccurate or, rather, incomplete answer to what I agree with him to be four very simple questions. And I would also state unequivocally Edelman's desire to work with him and the CIC in terms of further investigation and engagement with our industry, as outlined in his larger post of today.\n\nNB: Ben, you know, you said that you don't accept client assignments that aim to, as you said, obstruct or dilute regulation designed to address climate change. How does that square with your representation of say, like, the American Petroleum Institute. That's one of your clients, right?\n\nBB: Yeah, I think that the reality is, you know, this is - we want to paint a lot of these debates as black and white, right? So if you look at the notion of ethanol and greenhouse gas emissions and the points of view around ethanol as an acceptable alternative, the fact of the matter is that there are varying opinions. So, again, we do not work for deniers, but we recognize that there is great nuance and grey in this conversation. And I think what we have espoused in terms of our own corporate view is the need for business and government to work together as it relates to these large societal, complex issues and topics. But, again, we fully accept and believe the science behind climate change and we do not work for clients who deny that.\n\nKD: Well, one of your clients is the American Legislative Exchange Council, which just held its meeting in Dallas. And I don't know if Edelman's still working for them, but were in 2012 when they ran into some protests from outside groups. And ALEC just hosted this meeting with the Heartland Institute, with this other group called CFACT - hardcore climate deniers who were instructing legislators on how to attack the EPA, how to question the science. I don't know that you do that work with them -\n\nNB: Ben, do you still work with them?\n\nBB: I'd have to look at our client roster with, you know, thousands of clients on a varying school. I'd be happy to look at that, Kert, and connect back with you on that in terms of active engagement with them.\n\nNB: Ben, to Kert's point, do you - I mean, now that you - I say, you don't do that, have you, obviously, you're such a large firm, I can't even imagine how many clients you have. Do you have a process of going through and determining whether or not they're people you'll work with or won't work with them in terms of climate change?\n\nBB: I think we certainly have a policy, which is available on our website. It's pretty black and white. I think that policy is shared clearly internally and our client leaders are expected to uphold the values that we espouse as a firm and that we believe as a business, as the right and ethical way to operate. I cannot guarantee to you guys or anyone else that in a firm of 6,000 I won't have ethical lapses. What I can guarantee you is that when ethical lapses - when and if those lapses happen - and those choices, yaknow, have consequences and we move on those. But we do not consciously, especially from a management perspective, accept revenue from those who deny the science behind climate change.\n\nNB: Kert, let me ask you one last question. Which is - Ben was talking about the nuances of this. Did you hear other firms say that as well? What's your position on this?\n\nKD: You know, there was a broad range of responses to our survey - very interesting stuff. Some firms were being pushed by their clients. One firm engaged with IBM who said, \"well, what's your carbon footprint?\" to the ad firm and they didn't have one - they had to develop one to take the contract. Edelman has a whole carbon accounting program I didn't even know about because it's in the appendix to their citizenship report. They're doing their own carbon footprint and have targets on airline miles reduction. That's remarkable, but, as you said earlier, it barely squares with a multi-million dollar contract to push oil, push the Keystone pipeline, without mentioning potential carbon impacts. It's very easy in the ad industry to avoid subjects and to stress the positives -\n\nNB: well, but, Kert, to my question about - did you find that PR firms or other firms you talked to, are they saying \"no\" to these campaigns or are they saying no to firms that don't believe in climate change? What are other firms telling you?\n\nKD: Some committed - we didn't really ask that question. The Guardian asked that question and they got commitments that they were not working with climate deniers. And that is a major step forward - it's a question that, frankly, has never been put to this industry before. The reason we did this survey was because pretty much every other sector has been questioned about climate change. You take banking, or insurance, or, yaknow, the oil industry, obviously - all of them, over the decades, have been questioned, \"do you believe in this, do you think it's a major push?\" Because we have to have the corporate community working alongside governments to solve this problem, and the PR industry's just never been asked. So I think it's a work in progress, getting the PR industry to wake up to the fact that they are important. One commentator in an article said, this is probably the biggest PR problem in the world, getting people to understand climate change. It's a very hard thing to get done. We need the help of the PR professionals to do that.\n\nNB: And, Kert, now that Ben - uh, Ben, now that Kert has posed the question to you, what's your response to how you think PR firms - what responsibility do you think public relations firms and Edelman has to this whole issue of climate change and climate change deniers?\n\nBB: Yeah, not a great question. Unequivocally, I think we have stated that business has to play a role in solving these complex world problems. I don't think that Edelman or the PR industry is an exception to that, uh, assumption. I think the work that we do around the trust barometer looks and points to the expectations of peoples around the world in 27 countries where we survey for business to be a responsible good actor with, actually, greater trust in business to lead change. So, again, we do not work with those who deny the science. I think we continue to scrub, on a daily basis, our client roster and look at the behaviors of our clients - even outside the assignments that we have. And I think our commitment, as he outlined in terms of our own carbon footprint and presence, is something that we proactively began. Our work with Unilever, again, is a demonstration of a partnership in which we look at how to help raise larger conversations in the public sphere that are important around the topics of sustainability and corporate behavior. That has been, you know, a bold proclamation of our CEO in terms of what is necessary for business to be successful in the long term. And, again, we are not in any way immune from that belief.\n\nNB: Well, thank you so much both of you for joining me. That's Ben Boyd, the global chair of corporate practices for Edelman - based, of course, here in Chicago - and Kert Davies, the executive director of the Climate Investigations Center. Thank you.\n\nBB: Thanks very much.",

where the twain meet to be continued wbez afternoon shift august 5 2014 rough transcript niala boodhoo host youre listening to the afternoon shift im niala boodhoo the worlds most powerful public relations firms stake their business on having the ability to influence people and policy right well now it seems several top pr firms are taking a stand against climate change denial ten of the worlds largest public relations firms such as webershandwick and wpp thats the parent company of bursonmarsteller and ogilvy public relations say they will no longer do business with entities that reject the existence of climate change this is all because of a survey from the climate investigations center that was done with the uks guardian newspaper it tried to find out where the top pr houses stood on representing those who reject the science of climate change notably not on that list was chicagobased edelman public relations firm joining me to talk about why is edelmans ben boyd and kert davies the executive director of the climate investigations center gentlemen welcome to the afternoon shift kert davies cic thanks for having me ben boyd edelman pr thanks so much nb kert lets start with you whats the climate investigations center and why did you do this survey kd the climate investigations center is a relatively new organziation building on the work i did at greenpeace for thirteen years looking into the funding of climate science denial and organizations like the heartland institute there in chicago and exxons involvement in this the koch brothers involvement this organizations dedicated to researching and uncovering where the climate debate where the rubber meets the road so to speak so were digging into a variety of different things people can find out more at climateinvestigationsorg nb how many firms did you send this survey to kert kd we sent it to the top 25 firms operating in the us based on their revenue and uh its a lot of revenue nb and how many firms responded kd we only got responses from a few firms directly and then some punted to their parent organizations their parent companies thats wpp so in total we got direct responses from six firms and then we got indirect responses from another few its a mixed bag but we you know the response we accidentally got from edelman straight up was there are only wrong answers for this guy their ceo at the time who has now left the company accidentally emailed me so i think a lot of companies probably felt the same way we dont need to answer these questions and we think it was a pretty simple question do you acknowledge the threat of climate change nb well ben lets ask him uh lets ask you to respond to that do you want to answer that question if you bb i think look its really simple if i were kert id feel exactly the same way i mean the fact of the matter is that edelman fully recognizes the reality of and the science behind climate change and we do not accept client assignments that aim to deny climate change i think unfortunately and theres no excuse other than just poor communication which is probably ironic for a communications firm but you know junior staff handled the completion of the questionnaire it was not mark hass and again that email was completely unacceptable and inappropriate so you know i would begin by first clarifying that that is our position and i would also offer kert and the cic an apology for what was an inaccurate or rather incomplete answer to what i agree with him to be four very simple questions and i would also state unequivocally edelmans desire to work with him and the cic in terms of further investigation and engagement with our industry as outlined in his larger post of today nb ben you know you said that you dont accept client assignments that aim to as you said obstruct or dilute regulation designed to address climate change how does that square with your representation of say like the american petroleum institute

I'm Niala Boodhoo. The world's most powerful public relations firms stake their business on having the ability to influence people and policy, right? Well, now it seems several top PR firms are taking a stand against climate change denial. Ten of the world's largest public relations firms, such as Weber-Shandwick and WPP - that's the parent company of Burson-Marsteller and Ogilvy Public Relations - say they will no longer do business with entities that reject the existence of climate change. This is all because of a survey from the Climate Investigations Center that was done with the UK's Guardian newspaper. It tried to find out where the top PR houses stood on representing those who reject the science of climate change. Notably not on that list was Chicago-based Edelman Public Relations Firm. Joining me to talk about why is Edelman's Ben Boyd and Kert Davies, the executive director of the Climate Investigations Center. Gentlemen, welcome to the afternoon shift.\n\nKert Davies, CIC: Thanks for having me.\n\nBen Boyd, Edelman PR: Thanks so much.\n\nNB: Kert, let's start with you. What's the Climate Investigations Center and why did you do this survey?\n\nKD: The Climate Investigations Center is a relatively new organziation building on the work I did at Greenpeace for thirteen years, looking into the funding of climate science denial and organizations like the Heartland Institute there in Chicago, and Exxon's involvement in this, the Koch brother's involvement. This organization's dedicated to researching and uncovering where the climate debate - where the rubber meets the road, so to speak. So we're digging into a variety of different things. People can find out more at ClimateInvestigations.org.\n\nNB: How many firms did you send this survey to, Kert?\n\nKD: We sent it to the top 25 firms operating in the US based on their revenue and, uh, it's a lot of revenue.\n\nNB: And how many firms responded?\n\nKD: We only got responses from a few firms directly, and then some punted to their parent organizations, their parent companies - that's WPP. So, in total, we got direct responses from six [firms] and then we got indirect responses from another few. It's a mixed bag, but we, you know - the response we accidentally got from Edelman, straight up, was \"there are only wrong answers for this guy.\" Their CEO at the time, who has now left the company, accidentally emailed me. So, I think a lot of companies probably felt the same way - we don't need to answer these questions.

            "text": "A handful of the world's top public relations companies declared they will not represent clients who say man-made climate change doesn't exist, The Guardian reported.\n\n\n\nIn what is bound to be a game-changing decision in the global warming debate, ten PR firms said they will not work with anyone who denies climate change or tries to block policies meant to check air pollution by limiting carbon emissions.\n\n\n\n\"We would not knowingly partner with a client who denies the existence of climate change,\" the international PR firm Waggener Edstrom told The Guardian. \n\n\n\nPR companies Finn Partners, WPP, Text 100, and Weber Shandwick also made the same decision.\n\n\n\n\"We would not support a campaign that denies the existence and the threat posed by climate change, or efforts to obstruct regulations cutting greenhouse gas emissions and/or renewable energy standards,\" PR firm Weber Shandwick told the newspaper.\n\n\n\nMany PR firms have made a reputation for handling cases dealing with environmental policy. Environmental groups and experts have struggled for years to garner widespread public support for action to protect the environment. \n\n\n\nPart of their failings is blamed on PR companies accused of helping the spread of false information- or the disinformation campaign- meant to block solutions to climate change.\n\n\n\n\"The PR industry is a major component of the influence peddling industry that stretches across Washington and the world, and they are making large sums of money from energy companies and other important players that have businesses connected to fossil fuels and energy policy,\" Kert Davies, founder of the Climate Investigations Centre which researches disinformation campaigns, told The Guardian.\n\n\n\nOne American PR company was not so quick to join the trend of refusing clients against climate change. Endelman, the largest independently-owned PR firm in the world, told the newspaper it will accept clients on a case by case basis.\n\n\n\n\"Expanding the dialogue in a constructive manner and driving productive outcomes to solve energy challenges are the key criteria for evaluating client engagements,\" the company said.",

They provide the ingredients for medicines, fertilizers, fabrics, plastics and other products that make life safer, easier and better.\n\nWhile we rely on them for most of our energy and will likely do so for years to come, emissions from their production and use may be helping to warm our planet by enhancing the natural greenhouse effect of the atmosphere. That’s why oil and gas companies are also working to reduce their greenhouse emissions.\n\nTo start, they're closely managing their own energy use. One strategy involves heat and power technology that turns waste heat into energy, reducing energy consumption and emissions. The most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that CO2 greenhouse emissions from U.S. industry, including oil and natural gas companies, have declined and were actually below 1990 levels.\n\nCompanies are also expanding use of alternative energy with lower greenhouse emissions. They are researching, developing and/or marketing virtually every form of renewable or alternative energy, including solar power, biofuels, geothermal energy, and wind power. They are working with the automakers and government agencies on new fuel/vehicle technology such as fuel cells and hydrogen power. While companies must continue to meet the demands of today’s and tomorrow’s consumers for oil and gas, they are also preparing for a future in which alternatives will play a much more significant role.\n\nOn other fronts, companies are reducing natural gas flaring to cut emissions (while also adding to energy supplies) and storing CO2 underground, where it can be safely held for thousands of years. The oil and gas industry has also been implementing new emissions estimation and tracking tools to enable it to assess how well it is meeting the goals it has set for itself and report progress to the public.\n\nTo see more about what companies are doing, please view Companies Address Climate Change.

            "text": "Guardian: “Edelman, America’s biggest public relations firm, has for the first time formally declared it will not take on campaigns that deny global warming, in response to an investigation by the Guardian.”\n\n “However it is unclear on its commitment to existing clients that have been involved in spreading doubt about climate change and fighting regulations to cut carbon pollution.\n\n The explicit rejection comes in response to a story earlier this week that saw a number of top firms in the industry – but not Edelman – declare as a matter of company policy that they viewed climate change as a threat, and that they would not take on clients or campaigns that deny climate change.\n\n In an apparent damage control exercise, the PR firm alerted the Guardian to what may be the industry’s first official position on climate denial.\n\n ….However, Edelman still left itself room for manoeuvre. Bush later backpedalled on Boyd’s commitment to “scrub” the client roster, writing in an email: “We did not intend to suggest that we have launched a ‘scrubbing’ operation of our client roster, but that we continually look at our client portfolio. As you might imagine with thousands of clients it’s an ongoing exercise.”\n\n He also declined to say whether Edelman had let go or “scrubbed” clients – such as API and Alec that have been involved in spreading doubt about climate change and fighting regulations to cut carbon pollution.\n\n ….API has lobbied hard to expand oil and gas drilling, and speed construction of the Keystone XL pipeline from the Alberta tar sands. A carefully crafted statement on the API website does not explicitly deny the science of global warming, but it does inject an element of doubt where there is none over the link between the burning of fossil fuels and climate change.\n\n “While we rely on them for most of our energy and will likely do so for years to come, emissions from their production and use may be helping to warm our planet by enhancing the natural greenhouse effect of the atmosphere,” API says on its website.\n\n Alec meanwhile has sought to roll back clean energy rules and tax homeowners who install solar panels.\n\n Or as Boyd told WBEZ in Chicago this week: “We do not work for deniers, but we recognise that there is great nuance and grey in this conversation.”",

Yes. Edelman fully recognizes the reality of, and science behind, climate change, and believes it represents one of the most important global challenges facing society, business and government today. To be clear, we do not accept client assignments that aim to deny climate change. We believe that business, government and society must work together to address climate change by balancing the interdependent priorities of human development, the environment and the global economy. As such, we support our clients’ efforts to reduce emissions from their operations, improve energy efficiency, advance alternative fuels and sustainable energy solutions and lead in the transition to sustainable and socially responsible business models. We also work with clients to constructively participate in the dialogue around climate change and contribute to policy discussions, with the goal of making progress on this shared global challenge.          Does your company have any internal carbon accounting policies or energy use reduction targets? Have you taken actions to reduce your “carbon footprint”? As a firm we are determined to reduce emissions and foster an employee culture of sustainability. We hold ourselves accountable to reduce our carbon footprint at every Edelman office around the world. We have taken proactive steps to reduce our GHG emissions through document management, lighting efficiency, videoconferencing, local “green” citizenship teams, and global E-waste recycling. We track and report on the progress of these policies through our global citizenship dashboard. Each of the 65 offices in the Edelman network receives a customized dashboard about their specific progress toward these goals and is accountable for the continued progress and improvements made in their office.  Our progress toward these goals will be reported annually in our global citizenship report, the latest of which will be released in October 2014.          Does your company have an internal Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy regarding climate change or the environment generally?          Has your agency advised any client corporations on communications around CSR programs with a specific climate change focus, or on other climate change related public relations efforts? Yes. Edelman provides counsel to a range of clients across many industries, including counsel on CSR programs and on key issues such as climate change.

These prevent advertising that is intended to mislead, and the denial of climate change would fall into this category,” the company said.\n\nHowever, Fiona McEwan, a spokeswoman for the company, also said that the 150 companies within WPP were free to pick their own clients. The company also would still consider working with clients opposed to greenhouse gas regulations, she said.\n\nThe companies were responding to independent surveys by the London Guardian and the Washington-based group Climate Investigations Center, which researches disinformation campaigns about climate change.\n\n“The PR industry is a major component of the influence-peddling industry that stretches across Washington and the world, and they are making large sums of money from energy companies and other important players that have businesses connected to fossil fuels and energy policy,” said Kert Davies, the founder of Climate Investigations.\n\nDavies said the PR firms tended to give the appearance of neutrality to keep their client options open. Yet they are responsible for designing the campaigns that disseminate information about climate change, making them important players in the issue.\n\nNot all top 25 PR companies responded to the surveys.\n\nThe U.S.-based company Edelman did not say specifically whether it would work with clients that denied climate change.\n\n“Expanding the dialogue in a constructive manner and driving productive outcomes to solve energy challenges are the key criteria for evaluating client engagements,” said spokesman Michael Bush (Goldenberg/Karim,London Guardian, Aug. 4)",

the brattleboro vt area have contributed urine to the rich earth institute field trials let me guess how you feel about your urine get that smelly stuff away from me as fast as possible a small group of environmentalists in vermont isnt as squeamish instead of flushing their pee down the drain theyre collecting it with special toilets that separate no 1 and no 2 then theyre pooling the urine of the 170 volunteers in the pilot project a quart or so per person daily and eventually giving it to a farmer whos putting it on her hay fields in place of synthetic fertilizer the goal is to collect 6000 gallons this year the logic driving this avantgarde project of the rich earth institute based in brattleboro vt is that its foolish and wasteful to part with the precious nitrogen and phosphorus that moves from the food we eat right through us � especially when farmers have to buy fertilizer at great expense to put those very same nutrients back into the soil whats more founders abraham noehays and kim nace tell the salt once our urine enters the wastewater system drinking water carries it to a treatment facility where the nutrients become pollutants that can contaminate waterways and cause algal blooms among other issues one goal is preventing the pollution caused by peeing in water � keeping pee out of the waterways and protecting water quality says noehays and we can also make agriculture more sustainable and resilient by returning these nutrients to the soil urine is an inherently local and renewable source of fertilizer the idea of peecycling has much in common with the night soil tradition as well as the newer practice of using biosolids or sewage sludge thats been transformed into soil amendment for farmers several wastewater treatment plants in the us have been making and donating biosolids which are regulated by the environmental protection agency to farmers for years but the practice is controversial because some activists claim that even certified biosolids could contain harmful chemicals the average human generates 8 pounds of nitrogen and almost 1 pound of phosphorous in a years worth of urine and those nutrients come in a form that plants can use though rich earth is the only legally authorized and publicly documented urine reuse project in the us many other countries � rich and poor alike � have recognized its potential and are conducting their own research urine from a healthy person is sterile so using it on farmland is considered safe even the world health organization has guidelines for reusing urine in agriculture the problem though is that with the urinediverting toilets which some of the rei volunteers are using others have waterless urinals with removable containers the pee may get contaminated so to kill off germs nace and noehays are testing two sanitization methods pasteurization and storing it for a month or more which allows the alkalinity to develop over time and kill microbes they are also trying to determine if there are medicines in the waste that might wind up in plants grown for food so theyre sending samples to researchers at the university of michigan and university of buffalo to find out for a study funded by the epa so far the only farmer using the product grows hay as a forage crop for animals when the rich earth team measured the impact of the urine applied to her hay fields in 2013 they found that yields increased dramatically and word has gotten around their community they now have a waiting list seth true of best septic pumps urine from the 275gallon tank a family of three can fill a tank this size in eight months we have more farmers who want urine brought to them than infrastructure to do it says nace but we can only begin to service this region we would like to have enough scientific documentation that it could be replicated at the state level scaling up such a project isnt just a hope of hippie vermonters samantha antonini a researcher at the center for development research at the university of bonn in germany assessed two rather complex and expensive technologies for turning urine into fertilizer and found that agricultural yields with urine fertilizers were comparable to those achieved with commercial fertilizers europeans and particularly the swedes are intrigued by the idea but antonini tells us in an email theres a long way to go before you can even think of using urine as a commercial fertilizer given the rather stringent regulations in the eu in the developing world however she thinks these systems could be especially

has claimed a longterm experiment tracking the ants effects on soil suggests they cooled earths climate as their numbers grew ants are changing the environment said lead study author ronald dorn from the arizona state university in tempe certain ant species weather minerals in order to secrete calcium carbonate � better known as limestone the process traps and removes a tiny bit of carbon dioxide gas from the atmosphere dorn said this ant limestone factory is a smallscale version of the massive planetarycooling process that takes place in the oceans known as carbon sequestration live science reported dorn discovered that ants were powerful weathering agents by tracking the breakdown of basalt sand his experiment shows that ants appear to break down the minerals 50 to 300 times faster than sand left undisturbed on bare ground according to dorn the ants may be scavenging calcium and magnesium from the minerals and using these elements to make limestone in the process the insects may trap carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas in the rock the report said the transformation could take place when ants lick sand grains and stick them on the walls of their nests but dorn said the process is truly

scientists don�t currently know how the disease originates nor how to cure it they know the virus is transmitted via contact with an infected animal it appears that in most cases ebola outbreaks begin

global warming pause is real the global warming pause is significant the global warming pause is not likely to be permanent a future resumption of global warming at prepause rates � or even modestly

Instead of flushing their pee down the drain, they're collecting it with special toilets that separate No. 1 and No. 2.\n\n\n\nThen they're pooling the urine of the 170 volunteers in the pilot project (a quart or so, per person, daily) and eventually giving it to a farmer, who's putting it on her hay fields in place of synthetic fertilizer. The goal is to collect 6,000 gallons this year.\n\n\n\nThe logic driving this avant-garde project of the Rich Earth Institute, based in Brattleboro, Vt., is that it's foolish and wasteful to part with the precious nitrogen and phosphorus that moves from the food we eat right through us � especially when farmers have to buy fertilizer at great expense to put those very same nutrients back into the soil.\n\n\n\nWhat's more, founders Abraham Noe-Hays and Kim Nace tell The Salt, once our urine enters the wastewater system, drinking water carries it to a treatment facility, where the nutrients become pollutants that can contaminate waterways and cause algal blooms, among other issues.\n\n\n\n\"One goal is preventing the pollution caused by peeing in water � keeping pee out of the waterways and protecting water quality,\" says Noe-Hays. \"And we can also make agriculture more sustainable and resilient by returning these nutrients to the soil. Urine is an inherently local and renewable source of fertilizer.\"\n\n\n\nThe idea of \"pee-cycling\" has much in common with the \"night soil\" tradition, as well as the newer practice of using biosolids, or sewage sludge that's been transformed into soil amendment for farmers. Several wastewater treatment plants in the U.S. have been making and donating biosolids, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, to farmers for years. But the practice is controversial because some activists claim that even certified biosolids could contain harmful chemicals.\n\n\n\nThe average human generates 8 pounds of nitrogen and almost 1 pound of phosphorous in a year's worth of urine. And those nutrients come in a form that plants can use. Though Rich Earth is the only legally authorized and publicly documented urine reuse project in the U.S., many other countries � rich and poor alike � have recognized its potential, and are conducting their own research.\n\n\n\nUrine from a healthy person is sterile, so using it on farmland is considered safe: Even the World Health Organization has guidelines for reusing urine in agriculture.\n\n\n\nThe problem, though, is that with the urine-diverting toilets, which some of the REI volunteers are using (others have waterless urinals with removable containers), the pee may get contaminated. So to kill off germs, Nace and Noe-Hays are testing two sanitization methods: pasteurization and storing it for a month or more, which allows the alkalinity to develop over time and kill microbes.\n\n\n\nThey are also trying to determine if there are medicines in the waste that might wind up in plants grown for food. So they're sending samples to researchers at the University of Michigan and University of Buffalo to find out, for a study funded by the EPA.\n\n\n\nSo far the only farmer using the product grows hay as a forage crop for animals. When the Rich Earth team measured the impact of the urine applied to her hay fields in 2013, they found that yields increased dramatically. And word has gotten around their community; they now have a waiting list.\n\n\n\n Seth True of Best Septic pumps urine from the 275-gallon tank. A family of three can fill a tank this size in eight months. \n\n\n\n\"We have more farmers who want urine brought to them than infrastructure to do it,\" says Nace. \"But we can only begin to service this region. We would like to have enough [scientific] documentation that it could be replicated at the state level.\"\n\n\n\nScaling up such a project isn't just a hope of hippie Vermonters. Samantha Antonini, a researcher at the Center for Development Research at the University of Bonn in Germany, assessed two rather complex and expensive technologies for turning urine into fertilizer and found that agricultural yields with urine fertilizers were comparable to those achieved with commercial fertilizers.\n\n\n\nEuropeans, and particularly the Swedes, are intrigued by the idea. But, Antonini tells us in an email, \"there's a long way to go before you can even think of using urine as a commercial fertilizer given the rather stringent regulations in the EU.\"\n\n\n\nIn the developing world, however, she thinks these systems could be especially helpful for those who don't currently have access to any sanitation. But so far, there isn't much demand for it. Still, \"ecological sanitation\" is becoming a bit of a buzzword � the wonky version of \"pee-cycling.\"\n\n\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/07/31/336564120/should-we-return-the-nutrients-in-our-pee-back-to-the-farm?\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease!

Companies include WPP, Waggener Edstrom (WE) Worldwide, Weber Shandwick, Text100, and Finn Partners.\n\n\n\n�We would not knowingly partner with a client who denies the existence of climate change,� said Rhian Rotz, spokesman for WE. \n\n\n\nWeber Shandwick would also not take any campaign to block regulations cutting carbon emissions or promoting renewable energy. �We would not support a campaign that denies the existence and the threat posed by climate change, or efforts to obstruct regulations cutting greenhouse gas emissions and/or renewable energy standards,� spokeswoman Michelle Selesky said.\n\n\n\n�There may be scenarios in which we could represent a client that has different views on climate change, just not on this issue.�\n\n\n\nThe UK-based WPP, the world�s largest advertising firm by revenue and parent company of Burson Marsteller and Oglivy Public Relations, said taking on a client or campaign disputing climate change would violate company guidelines.\n\n\n\n�We ensure that our own work complies with local laws, marketing codes and our own code of business conduct. These prevent advertising that is intended to mislead and the denial of climate change would fall into this category,� the company said.\n\n\n\nHowever, Fiona McEwan, a spokeswoman for the company, said the 150 companies within WPP made their own decisions on clients and would not rule out campaigns opposing regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\nThe US-based Edelman, which is the world�s largest independently owned PR firm, did not explicitly rule out taking on climate deniers as clients.\n\n\n\n�Expanding the dialogue in a constructive manner, and driving productive outcomes to solve energy challenges are the key criteria for evaluating client engagements,� said spokesman Michael Bush.\n\n\n\nHe said Edelman takes on clients on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\n\nThe PR firms were responding to surveys conducted independently by the Guardian and the Climate Investigations Centre, a Washington-based group that conducts research on climate disinformation campaigns.

Oglivy Public Relations told CIC that it recognised the risks of climate change, and that it had worked on campaigns for WWF and Greenpeace.

            "text": "The potential consequences of Drax's legal defeat on biomass subsidies \n\n The Court of Appeal has ruled against power generator Drax in its row with the government over biomass subsidies. Drax applied for a new subsidy to convert two units from coal to biomass, with the government originally allocating funds to both units. Later, the government decided only one unit was eligible for the subsidy. Drax took the government to court claiming the overruling was unfair, and won. The government then appealed, and won. Confused? The Telegraph has a good primer. The upshot is that Drax has the original subsidy for one unit, and can apply for a new - potentially less lucrative subsidy - for the other unit. The main disadvantage of the court ruling to Drax \"is lack of certainty on price\", the Guardian's Nils Pratley says. But it's not the end of the world, he argues - \"maybe the financial risks are worth taking anyway. Clear it ain't - but that's today's energy market\". \n\n Guardian\n\nScience shut down at crippled UK Antarctic base \n\n The electrical and heating systems failed at the UK's Halley Research Station in Antarctica last week, meaning all science \"ground to a halt\" at the base.

Infographic claims to reveal the four scenarios awaiting humanity - and NONE of them are great \n\n The World Resources Institute has released an infographic outlining the climate impacts associated with four potential emissions reduction pathways. In the worst case scenario, the world's carbon budget is exhausted by 2045, a range of species are threatened by extinction, crop yields are hit, and serious flooding becomes more likely. The infographic is based on research in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's recent report. \n\n Daily Mail \n\n \n\n Tidal power generator unveiling hailed as landmark \n\n A 400 kilowatt tidal generator has been unveiled at Ramsey Sound in Permbrokeshire.

            "text": "Edelman, America’s biggest public relations firm, has for the first time formally declared it will not take on campaigns that deny global warming, in response to an investigation by the Guardian. However it is unclear on its commitment to existing clients that have been involved in spreading doubt about climate change and fighting regulations to cut carbon pollution.\n\nThe explicit rejection comes in response to a story earlier this week that saw a number of top firms in the industry – but not Edelman – declare as a matter of company policy that they viewed climate change as a threat, and that they would not take on clients or campaigns that deny climate change.\n\nIn an apparent damage control exercise, the PR firm alerted the Guardian to what may be the industry’s first official position on climate denial.\n\nA statement on its website reads: “Edelman fully recognises the reality of, and science behind, climate change, and believes it represents one of the most important global challenges facing society, business and government today. To be clear, we do not accept client assignments that aim to deny climate change.”\n\nMichael Bush, a spokesman for Edelman, expressed regret for the company’s earlier response. “Unfortunately, that position was not fully shared … when [the Guardian] initially reached out to us.”\n\nEdelman and other top PR firms earn millions every year crafting messages and campaigns surrounding climate change. Edelman reportedly had earnings of $747m last year, and has represented the powerful oil industry lobby, the American Petroleum Institute (API), as well as conservative groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), that oppose Barack Obama’s environmental agenda.\n\nAfter other industry leaders such as WPP and Weber Shandwick came out against climate deniers, an Edelman executive, Ben Boyd, told a Chicago radio programme: “we do not work for deniers”. Boyd also said the company would “scrub, on a daily basis, our client roster and look at the behaviours of our clients”.\n\nThe commitment was a departure for Edelman, which earlier told the Guardian it took on clients on a case-by-case basis.\n\n“Expanding the dialogue in a constructive manner, and driving productive outcomes to solve energy challenges are the key criteria for evaluating client engagements,”Bush added in an email.\n\nEdelman had also been reluctant to respond to an earlier survey by the Climate Investigations Centre, inadvertently emailing researchers: “There are only wrong answers to this guy”.\n\nKert Davies, the founder of Climate Investigations, said the Edelman’s position was an important shift. “Edelman’s position on climate change before this statement was at best opaque. Now they might be the first big PR firm to actually have a published ‘position’ on climate change and rejecting climate science denial,” he wrote in an email. “This is a big step … and it might pull the rest of the industry along to take a firm stance on climate change.”\n\nHowever, Edelman still left itself room for manoeuvre. Bush later backpedalled on Boyd’s commitment to “scrub” the client roster, writing in an email: “We did not intend to suggest that we have launched a ‘scrubbing’ operation of our client roster, but that we continually look at our client portfolio. As you might imagine with thousands of clients it’s an ongoing exercise.”\n\nHe also declined to say whether Edelman had let go or “scrubbed” clients – such as API and Alec that have been involved in spreading doubt about climate change and fighting regulations to cut carbon pollution.\n\nEdelman has a rigorous in-house carbon accounting system. In a blogpost last month, its chief executive, Richard Edelman, wrote that business should be involved in seeking market solutions to climate change and expressed concern that some 40% of Americans believe that humans are not changing the climate. “There is a significant failure of communications regarding the environment,” Edelman wrote.\n\nAPI has lobbied hard to expand oil and gas drilling, and speed construction of the Keystone XL pipeline from the Alberta tar sands. A carefully crafted statement on the API website does not explicitly deny the science of global warming, but it does inject an element of doubt where there is none over the link between the burning of fossil fuels and climate change.\n\n“While we rely on them for most of our energy and will likely do so for years to come, emissions from their production and use may be helping to warm our planet by enhancing the natural greenhouse effect of the atmosphere,” API says on its website.\n\nAlec meanwhile has sought to roll back clean energy rules and tax homeowners who install solar panels.\n\nOr as Boyd told WBEZ in Chicago this week: “We do not work for deniers, but we recognise that there is great nuance and grey in this conversation.”",

            "text": "Edelman fired US president and CEO Mark Hass in July partly over his \"stupid\" response to a climate change organization's survey of PR firms, CEO Richard Edelman told Vice.com's Motherboard channel.\n\nVice senior editor Brian Merchant, who penned an Aug. 5 piece critical of Edelman's work with the American Petroleum Institute regarding climate change, said Edelman called him at home to stress that the firm \"recognizes the reality of climate change and accepts the science behind the claim.\"\n\nThe crux of the episode was a survey and report by the Guardian and the Climate Investigations Center, a research organization led by Greenpeace vet Kert Davies, which queried large PR agencies about working with climate change deniers. Firms like Weber Shandwick, Waggener Edstrom and Finn Partners all said they would not accept such business. \n\n\n\nEdelman stood out in its response because it wouldn't rule out work for those that contest climate change science. \"I do not believe we are obligated in any way to participate,\" said an email by Hass apparently intended for internal Edelman discussion that was sent to CIC. \"There are no right answers for this guy.\"\n\nThe firm's on-the-record response to the CIC survey also raised flags.\n\n“Expanding the dialogue in a constructive manner, and driving productive outcomes to solve energy challenges are the key criteria for evaluating client engagements,” Edelman spokesman Michael Bush told the Guardian, noting the firm takes clients on a case-by-case basis.\n\nEdelman told Merchant this week that Hass was bounced partly because of the episode. Edelman posted the firm's official position on climate change on his blog after Merchant's critical report on Aug. 7.\n\n\"We fired the head of our US [division] in part because of that stupid note he wrote, about, you know, how we don't answer these kinds of things,\" Edelman told Merchant. The CEO of PR's largest firm said the firm's was misrepresented because of \"the ham-head who filled out the questionnaire to be a little, uh, slick. And I don't like that.\"\n\nThe firm previously said that Hass, former CEO of MSLGroup, was leaving after five years to pursue other interests.",

            "text": "Public relations (PR) is a powerful but unseen force in our society. Companies hire PR firms to make them look as good as possible. When the companies do something they are proud of, they do everything they can to make sure everyone hears about it (including, sometimes contacting reporters like us). When the companies do things that are not so great, they “spin” the news to make it sound harmless. PR firms make their money from fees paid by their clients and have typically been value-neutral, meaning that they promote whatever their clients want them to promote.\n\nSo it’s a pretty big deal when a number of the largest PR firms come out, in response to surveys administered by the Guardian and the Climate Investigations Centre, and collectively announce that they will no longer represent firms that want to spread messages denying the reality of man’s role in climate disruption. Among these firms are: WPP, Waggener Edstrom (WE) Worldwide, Weber Shandwick, Text100 and Finn Partners.\n\nWeber Shandwick spokeswoman Michelle Selesky told the Guardian that, “We would not support a campaign that denies the existence and the threat posed by climate change, or efforts to obstruct regulations cutting greenhouse gas emissions and/or renewable energy standards.”\n\nLikewise, Rhian Rotz, speaking for WE said, “We would not knowingly partner with a client who denies the existence of climate change.”\n\nWPP, based in the U.K., is the world’s largest advertising firm by revenue. They commented that, “We ensure that our own work complies with local laws, marketing codes and our own code of business conduct. These prevent advertising that is intended to mislead and the denial of climate change would fall into this category,”\n\nHowever, a spokesperson noted that individual entities within the organizations remain free to make their own client decisions, which could include “campaigns opposing regulations to cut greenhouse gas emissions.”\n\nNotably absent from this group was the U.S.-based Edelman, the largest, independently-owned PR firm in the world. Edelman’s sizable client roster includes the American Petroleum Institute, a group that actively campaigns against climate regulations, as well as Shell and Chevron. The firm took the position that it evaluates clients on a case-by-case basis. Spokesman Michael Bush politely dodged the question, stating only that, “Expanding the dialogue in a constructive manner, and driving productive outcomes to solve energy challenges are the key criteria for evaluating client engagements.”\n\nThat was early in the week, before the Guardian ran their story. A few days later Edelman came back with a quickly reconsidered position – a classic example of damage control. A statement on their website read, “Edelman fully recognizes the reality of, and science behind, climate change, and believes it represents one of the most important global challenges facing society, business and government today. To be clear, we do not accept client assignments that aim to deny climate change.”\n\nOf course, denying climate change and trying to block responsive action are two different things, but the statement is still a significant one. After all, if we could take denial off the table completely, responsive action would be far easier to achieve.\n\nRichard Edelman, CEO, also wrote a blog post on the issue entitled “The Climate Change Imperative.” The article describes a dinner conversation he’d had with Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, about the need for dramatic action on climate change, in which he made the case for strong private-sector involvement. He closed by quoting Keith Weed, CMO for Unilever, who, when asked to see the business case for sustainability, said, “I would love to see the business case for the alternative.”\n\nRP Siegel, PE, is an author, inventor and consultant.

though i was immediately wary of a master at work the connection wasnt great so richard edelmans voice was staticflecked as he exhorted im totally unequivocal about climate change its rare that a chief executive of any pr firm much less that of the biggest shop going would take the trouble to call a journalist directly but the day before i had published an article that explained how his company edelman had helped—mostly indirectly but sometimes directly—to promote climate change denial that piece enumerated some of the ways that edelman assists organizations like the american petroleum institute which fund efforts to publicize the scientifically invalid views that global warming is either not manmade or not occurring to any substantial degree my story grew out of a survey conducted by the climate investigations center last april and published by the guardian this august ten of the worlds largest pr firms said they would refuse to represent clients that trafficked in climate denial among the heaviest hitters who responded only edelman wouldnt commit to the same how the worlds biggest pr firm helps promote climate change denial mark hass then the head of edelman us replied to the cics email questionnaire on april 4th perhaps inadvertently ccing the surveygiver on what may have been intended as an internal message i do not believe we are obligated in any way to participate he wrote there are no right answers for this guy edelman was calling to tell me that this email wasnt reflective of his firms work and that the guardian and i had his firms stance on climate all wrong i just want you to know were not bad people thats all he said he also wanted to apologize he said because it wasnt really our fault his team had failed to respond appropriately first to the survey then to any of my multiple requests for comment edelman would not deny continuing to work with at least three major organs of climate change denial we fired the head of our us division in part because of that stupid note he wrote about you know how we dont answer these kinds of things edelman said in an article published in ad age on april 23r d hass said he was stepping down due to issues with the firms succession plan and made no mention of the survey or climate change i asked edelman if he felt his firms stance on climate change had been misrepresented yes deeply deeply i dont blame the guardian reporter any more than i blame you—i blame the hamhead who filled out the questionnaire to be a little uh slick and i dont like that he said i do want you to know i respect what you did as a journalist and you know you haunted me he added the next day edelman wrote a blog post on his companys website that stated that i had completely misrepresented his firms position on climate change i want to set the record straight he wrote edelman recognizes the reality of climate change and accepts the science behind the claim we do not accept clients that seek to deny climate change our longstanding position on the issue is available on our site he wrote linking to the blog post his company had published the day before an extensive search on the site yielded no other definitive climate policy statements in fact upon its publication the guardian hailed edelmans initial blog post as a new milestone in the pr industry—statement by americas biggest public relations firm may be the industrys first official position on climate denial the articles subhead read its good that they put in writing that they have a climate policy kert davies the executive director of the climate investigations center wrote me in an email that didnt exist before unfortunately for the policy to amount to a laudable milestone the company actually has to adhere to it as this story goes to press edelman would not deny continuing to work with at least three major organs of climate change denial the american petroleum institute api the energy company eon and the american legislative exchange council alec why morgan stanley is betting that tesla will kill your power company api as i noted in my previous article has funded a network of individuals campaigns and shell groups that seek to deny climate change according to a 2012 report from the liberal watchdog group media matters api funds at least four think tanks and public figures that spread messages of climate denial through television appearances policy papers and congressional testimony i also wrote that api had organized with edelmans help the astroturf group energy citizens to oppose climate legislation back in 2009 so i thought it was a little strange when richard edelman wrote in his rebuttal to my piece we do not work with astroturf groups and we have never created a website for a client with the intent to deny climate change because here is a leaked document wherein api president jack gerard unveiled the blueprint for creating the energy citizens and called for support from oil companies and here is a detailed washington post story about how edelman and api collaborated to promote that astroturf group the nations biggest oil and gas lobby and its public relations firm recruited ordinary people to be cast members in an upcoming ad campaign the post reported—and of course the whole thing was scripted the center for media and democracy provided more details on how edelman coordinated a print and tv ad campaign for the energy citizens astroturf group called im an energy voter edelman also built affiliated websites vote4energy energy tomorrow for the astroturf group —all of which contain materials that downplay climate change and at least one that promotes links to websites like globalwarmingorg that work to deny outright that it is occurring in a separate report the sightline institute found that edelman has a welldocumented history of astroturf activities one product of apis astroturf campaign which portrays efforts to reduce carbon emissions proposed by congress as an energy tax the explicit purpose of energy citizens was to oppose congresss efforts to address climate change it did so by promoting through media buys and staged rallies the message that curbing greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change would amount to an energy tax edelman in other words worked to help kill what many agreed was the single best chance the nation has ever had to pass climate legislation for all of the above api earned the no 5 spot on mother jones dirty dozen of climate change denial materials on apis website do limply acknowledge that climate change exists though the copy greatly misrepresents the science the contribution of possible manmade warming is uncertain as are the extent and timing of potential future impacts reads an overview of the climate change issue from the us oil and natural gas industry though science is always filled with uncertainties climatologists no longer consider manmade warming merely possible—97 percent of them agree that it is occurring right now i actually dont believe that api is a bad actor in this i really dont richard edelman told me he said he thinks api is a broad coalition and compared it to the democratic party as far as the climate change denial some guys are for it and some are not he said as for eon an energy company that was working to open the uks newest coal plant—the one that so angered environmental activists that they gathered at edelmans uk office with a banner that read edelman is spinning the climate out of control—edelman said that contracts still fair game too look yes we do represent in the uk office that eon factory whatever the coal plant he told me but they also do a lot of work on renewables and whatever edelman has also caught flack for flacking for the keystone xl pipeline the latest estimates for which conclude the project will produce 110 million tons of carbon pollution every year the ceo brought that one up himself by the way i dont know where you are on keystone and anything to do with canada and the oil sands he said my view is if its done properly its at least something to consider we do a lot of work with ge and ge says theres a good way to do this and a bad way im not enough of a scientist to know so edelman represents coal and oil companies and helps spin their efforts to sell the public on their products which are the prime drivers of climate change though each entity definitely seeks to deny climate change in different ways there is perhaps a shred of ambiguity in the manner in which they do so there is little ambiguity with alec the american legislative exchange council is a consortium of conservative politicians and businessmen who work together to push legislation at the state level critics call the group a bill mill edelman represented alec after it came under fire for its role in crafting socalled stand your ground laws after one of them allowed george zimmerman to walk free after shooting and killing trayvon martin in 2012 alec also began pushing model bills mandating the teaching of climate change denial or skepticism in public school systems according to investigative journalist steve horn texas and louisiana have introduced education standards that require educators to teach climate change denial as a valid scientific position the la times reported in 2012 tennessee and oklahoma also have introduced legislation to give climate change skeptics a place in the classroom what the excellent times coverage missed is that key language in these antiscience bills all emanated from a single source the american legislative exchange council or alec horn wrote in his followup the legislation was written in tandem with the heartland institute which is by most counts the veritable epicenter of american climate denial heartland is perhaps most famous for putting up a billboard in chicago that compared anyone who believed in global warming to the unabomber such bills sought to force teachers to inject doubt into their climate science curricula—they literally try to teach climate change denial to children some of them passed in tennessee teaching climate change denial to kids is the law of the land these ad firms still have multimilliondollar contracts with fossil fuel companies to promote more oil gas and coal mining and drilling heartland which was a member of alec at least in 20102011 continues to partner with the group to wage attacks on climate science and clean energy recently the washington post reported that alec and heartland had teamed up to work to repeal clean energy laws across the country presumably edelman continues to represent alec too i say presumably because richard edelman wouldnt answer my question about alec or any of my followups for that matter wed concluded the phone call with an agreement richard edelman would publish his blog post and then circle back if you feel like you want to talk further after that im happy to do that he said he reiterated the sentiment in another email to me sent before his post went live but apparently he changed his mind after he indicted me for misrepresenting his firm then accepting responsibility for not replying to my questions he decided not to reply to my questions i am going to let my blog be my last comment he wrote upon their receipt perhaps the years spent helping companies say one thing and do another have inoculated edelman against actual truthfulness perhaps its executives genuinely believe the spin theyre shellacking onto their own spin perhaps thats how edelman can write in a july blog post without a trace of irony that 40 percent of americans believe that humans are not changing the climate there is a significant failure of communications regarding the environment but its pretty simple enacting a policy that states you will not accept a client that seeks to deny climate change requires dismissing those clients that seek to deny climate change otherwise its not a policy its just a blog post the firm can only credibly claim that policy is sincere by severing ties with alec and api in our conversation and on his blog richard points to the good things he and his firm are doing—edelman pr has a rigorous inhouse carbon accounting scheme for one and he told me that we do more in climate change work for walmart unilever heinz by far than for api and he stresses hes working with environmentalist jeffrey sachs on messaging to get nations behind the paris 2015 goals on emissions those are commendable deeds but it doesnt change the fact that edelman is safeguarding the image of companies that are working sometimes mightily to misinform the public about climate change so that they can continue unencumbered to emit the pollution that is contributing to it we got their attention and hope that edelman and others will be making decisions as a company with climate change more top of mind here forward but there is a long way to go the climate investigation centers davies said these ad firms still have multimilliondollar contracts with fossil fuel companies to promote more oil gas and coal mining and drilling access to public lands and avoidance of taxes and regulations if they are doing a campaign to promote fossil fuels and they avoid talking about the climate impacts he said thats climate denial",

            "title": "The World's Biggest PR Firm Is In Denial About Its Climate Change Denial", 
            "url": "http://motherboard.vice.com/en_ca/read/the-worlds-biggest-pr-firm-is-in-denial-about-its-climate-change-denial", 
            "text": "When the CEO of the world's largest PR firm called me at home, he sounded sincerely distraught, though I was immediately wary of a master at work. The connection wasn't great, so Richard Edelman's voice was static-flecked as he exhorted, \"I'm totally unequivocal about climate change.\"\n\nIt's rare that a chief executive of any PR firm, much less that of the biggest shop going, would take the trouble to call a journalist directly. But the day before, I had published an article that explained how his company, Edelman, had helped—mostly indirectly, but sometimes directly—to promote climate change denial. That piece enumerated some of the ways that Edelman assists organizations like the American Petroleum Institute, which fund efforts to publicize the scientifically invalid views that global warming is either not manmade or not occurring to any substantial degree.\n\nMy story grew out of a survey conducted by the Climate Investigations Center last April and published by the Guardian this August. Ten of the world's largest PR firms said they would refuse to represent clients that trafficked in climate denial. Among the heaviest hitters who responded, only Edelman wouldn't commit to the same.\n\nMark Hass, then the head of Edelman US, replied to the CIC's email questionnaire on April 4th, perhaps inadvertently CCing the survey-giver on what may have been intended as an internal message. \"I do not believe we are obligated in any way to participate,\" he wrote. \"There are no right answers for this guy.\"\n\nEdelman was calling to tell me that this email wasn't reflective of his firm's work, and that the Guardian and I had his firm's stance on climate all wrong.\n\n\"I just want you to know we're not bad people, that's all,\" he said.\n\nHe also wanted to apologize, he said, because it wasn't really our fault: his team had failed to respond appropriately, first to the survey, then to any of my multiple requests for comment.\n\n\"We fired the head of our US [division] in part because of that stupid note he wrote, about, you know, how we don't answer these kinds of things,\" Edelman said. (In an article published in Ad Age on April 23rd, Hass said he was stepping down due to issues with the firm's \"succession plan,\" and made no mention of the survey or climate change.)\n\nI asked Edelman if he felt his firm’s stance on climate change had been misrepresented. \"Yes. Deeply. Deeply. I don't blame the Guardian reporter any more than I blame you—I blame the ham-head who filled out the questionnaire to be a little, uh, slick. And I don't like that,\" he said.\n\n\"I do want you to know I respect what you did as a journalist and, you know, you haunted me,\" he added.\n\nThe next day, Edelman wrote a blog post on his company's website that stated that I had \"completely misrepresented [his] firm's position on climate change.\"\n\n\"I want to set the record straight,\" he wrote. \"Edelman recognizes the reality of climate change and accepts the science behind the claim. We do not accept clients that seek to deny climate change.\"\n\n\"Our long-standing position on the issue is available on our site,\" he wrote, linking to the blog post his company had published the day before. An extensive search on the site yielded no other definitive climate policy statements.\n\nIn fact, upon its publication, the Guardian hailed Edelman’s initial blog post as a new milestone in the PR industry—\"Statement by America's biggest public relations firm may be the industry’s first official position on climate denial,\" the article's subhead read.\n\n\"It's good that they put in writing that they have a climate policy,\" Kert Davies, the executive director of the Climate Investigations Center, wrote me in an email. \"That didn't exist before.\"\n\nUnfortunately, for the policy to amount to a laudable milestone, the company actually has to adhere to it. As this story goes to press, Edelman would not deny continuing to work with at least three major organs of climate change denial: The American Petroleum Institute (API), the energy company E.On, and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).\n\nWhy Morgan Stanley is Betting That Tesla Will Kill Your Power Company\n\nAPI, as I noted in my previous article, has funded a network of individuals, campaigns, and shell groups that seek to deny climate change. According to a 2012 report from the liberal watchdog group Media Matters, API funds at least four think tanks and public figures that spread messages of climate denial through television appearances, policy papers, and congressional testimony.\n\nI also wrote that API had organized, with Edelman's help, the astroturf group Energy Citizens to oppose climate legislation back in 2009. So I thought it was a little strange when Richard Edelman wrote in his rebuttal to my piece, \"We do not work with astroturf groups and we have never created a website for a client with the intent to deny climate change.\"\n\nBecause here is a leaked document wherein API president Jack Gerard unveiled the blueprint for creating the Energy Citizens, and called for support from oil companies. And here is a detailed Washington Post story about how Edelman and API collaborated to promote that astroturf group.\n\n\"The nation’s biggest oil and gas lobby and its public relations firm recruited ordinary people to be cast members in an upcoming ad campaign,\" the Post reported—and of course, the whole thing was scripted.\n\nThe Center for Media and Democracy provided more details on how Edelman coordinated a print and TV ad campaign for the Energy Citizens astroturf group called \"I'm an Energy Voter.\" Edelman also built affiliated websites (Vote4Energy, Energy Tomorrow) for the astroturf group—all of which contain materials that downplay climate change, and at least one that promotes links to websites like GlobalWarming.org that work to deny outright that it is occurring. (In a separate report, the Sightline Institute found that \"Edelman has a well-documented history of astroturf activities.\")\n\nOne product of API's astroturf campaign, which portrays efforts to reduce carbon emissions proposed by Congress as an \"energy tax.\"\n\nThe explicit purpose of Energy Citizens was to oppose Congress's efforts to address climate change. It did so by promoting through media buys and staged rallies the message that curbing greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change would amount to an \"energy tax.\"\n\nEdelman, in other words, worked to help kill what many agreed was the single best chance the nation has ever had to pass climate legislation.\n\nFor all of the above, API earned the No. 5 spot on Mother Jones' \"Dirty Dozen of Climate Change Denial.\" Materials on API's website do limply acknowledge that climate change exists, though the copy greatly misrepresents the science: \"The contribution of possible man-made warming is uncertain as are the extent and timing of potential future impacts,\" reads An Overview of the Climate Change Issue from the U.S. Oil and Natural Gas Industry. Though science is always filled with uncertainties, climatologists no longer consider manmade warming merely \"possible\"—97 percent of them agree that it is occurring, right now.\n\n\"I actually don't believe that API is a bad actor in this, I really don't,\" Richard Edelman told me. He said he thinks API is a \"broad coalition,\" and compared it to the Democratic Party. As far as the climate change denial, \"some guys are for it, and some are not,\" he said.\n\nAs for E.On, an energy company that was working to open the UK's newest coal plant—the one that so angered environmental activists that they gathered at Edelman’s UK office with a banner that read \"Edelman is spinning the climate out of control\"—Edelman said that contract's still fair game, too.\n\n\"Look, yes, we do represent in the UK office that E.On factory, whatever, the coal plant,\" he told me. \"But they also do a lot of work on renewables, and whatever.\"\n\nEdelman has also caught flack for flacking for the Keystone XL pipeline, the latest estimates for which conclude the project will produce 110 million tons of carbon pollution every year. The CEO brought that one up himself.\n\n\"By the way, I don't know where you are on Keystone and anything to do with Canada and the oil sands,\" he said. \"My view is, if it's done properly, it's at least something to consider. We do a lot of work with GE. And GE says there's a good way to do this and a bad way. I'm not enough of a scientist to know.\"\n\nSo Edelman represents coal and oil companies, and helps spin their efforts to sell the public on their products, which are the prime drivers of climate change. Though each entity definitely \"seeks to deny climate change\" in different ways, there is perhaps a shred of ambiguity in the manner in which they do so.\n\nThere is little ambiguity with ALEC. The American Legislative Exchange Council is a consortium of conservative politicians and businessmen who work together to push legislation at the state level. Critics call the group a \"bill mill.\" Edelman represented ALEC after it came under fire for its role in crafting so-called Stand Your Ground laws after one of them allowed George Zimmerman to walk free after shooting and killing Trayvon Martin.\n\nIn 2012, ALEC also began pushing model bills \"mandating the teaching of climate change denial or 'skepticism'\" in public school systems, according to investigative journalist Steve Horn.\n\n\"Texas and Louisiana have introduced education standards that require educators to teach climate change denial as a valid scientific position,\" the LA Times reported in 2012. \"Tennessee and Oklahoma also have introduced legislation to give climate change skeptics a place in the classroom.\"\n\n\"What the excellent Times coverage missed is that key language in these anti-science bills all emanated from a single source: the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC,\" Horn wrote in his follow-up.\n\nThe legislation was written in tandem with the Heartland Institute, which is, by most counts, the veritable epicenter of American climate denial. (Heartland is perhaps most famous for putting up a billboard in Chicago that compared anyone who believed in global warming to the Unabomber.) Such bills sought to force teachers to inject doubt into their climate science curricula—they literally try to teach climate change denial to children. Some of them passed. In Tennessee, teaching climate change denial to kids is the law of the land.\n\nHeartland, which was a member of ALEC at least in 2010-2011, continues to partner with the group to wage attacks on climate science and clean energy. Recently, the Washington Post reported that ALEC and Heartland had teamed up to work to repeal clean energy laws across the country.\n\nPresumably, Edelman continues to represent ALEC, too. I say presumably, because Richard Edelman wouldn’t answer my question about ALEC. Or any of my follow-ups, for that matter. We’d concluded the phone call with an agreement: Richard Edelman would publish his blog post, and then circle back.\n\n\"If you feel like you want to talk further after that, I'm happy to do that,\" he said. He reiterated the sentiment in another email to me, sent before his post went live. But apparently, he changed his mind. After he indicted me for misrepresenting his firm, then accepting responsibility for not replying to my questions, he decided not to reply to my questions.\n\n\"I am going to let my blog be my last comment,\" he wrote, upon their receipt.\n\nPerhaps the years spent helping companies say one thing and do another have inoculated Edelman against actual truthfulness. Perhaps its executives genuinely believe the spin they're shellacking onto their own spin. Perhaps that's how Edelman can write in a July blog post, without a trace of irony, that \"40 percent of Americans believe that humans are not changing the climate. There is a significant failure of communications regarding the environment.\"\n\nBut it’s pretty simple: enacting a policy that states you will not \"accept a client that seeks to deny climate change” requires dismissing those clients that seek to deny climate change. Otherwise, it's not a policy, it's just a blog post. The firm can only credibly claim that policy is sincere by severing ties with ALEC and API.\n\nIn our conversation and on his blog, Richard points to the good things he and his firm are doing—Edelman PR has a rigorous in-house carbon accounting scheme, for one, and he told me that \"we do more in climate change work for Walmart, Unilever, Heinz by far,\" than for API. And he stresses he's working with environmentalist Jeffrey Sachs \"on messaging to get nations behind the Paris 2015 goals on emissions.\"\n\nThose are commendable deeds. But it doesn't change the fact that Edelman is safeguarding the image of companies that are working, sometimes mightily, to misinform the public about climate change so that they can continue, unencumbered, to emit the pollution that is contributing to it.\n\n\"We got their attention and hope that Edelman and others will be making decisions as a company with climate change more top of mind here forward. But there is a long way to go,\" the Climate Investigation Center’s Davies said. \"These ad firms still have multimillion-dollar contracts with fossil fuel companies to promote more oil, gas and coal mining and drilling, access to public lands, and avoidance of taxes and regulations.\"\n\n\"If they are doing a campaign to promote fossil fuels and they avoid talking about the climate impacts,\" he said, \"that's climate denial.\"",

            "url": "http://www.edelman.com/p/6-a-m/climate-change-imperative/", 
            "text": "I went to the home of Professor Jeffrey Sachs, director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University, last night for dinner. Sachs, a Harvard classmate (one of those people you identified at age 18 as having superior intellect), has taken a leadership role in the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), a coalition of academics, business and non-governmental organizations. SDSN released a white paper earlier this month called “Pathways to Deep Decarbonization,” a plan to limit the mean temperature increase to less than two degrees Centigrade, which was agreed to by major nations at the 2010 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference in Cancun, Mexico. Sachs noted that earlier in the day the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that June 2014 was the hottest June since the start of records in 1880, 1.3 degrees warmer than the average of the 20th century and warmer than the previous record year of June, 2010. He noted that the current global trajectory is toward a four-to-six degree Centigrade increase in temperature by the end of the century; “The world is on a very dangerous path,” Sachs asserted.\n\nSachs is seeking a step-reduction in CO2 emissions. At present, the U.S. emits around 16 tons of carbon dioxide per person, China around eight tons, while the world average is around five tons per person. “We need to cut tons of carbon emitted per capita by around two-thirds by 2050,” he said. Among his ideas are a move away from carbon heavy fuels such as coal; use of renewable sources of energy with focus on solar and wind; carbon capture and sequestration into geological aquifers; mass electrification of motor vehicles; next generation nuclear facilities (France gets a large percentage of its power from nuclear); gains in energy efficiency in commercial and residential buildings; a change in lifestyle patterns; and urban planning and reimagining of industrial processes (think of electric heating of metals instead of old method of smelting).\n\nAccording to Sachs, the U.S. and China are the decisive votes at the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP) 21 climate negotiations that will be held in Paris in December, 2015. The EU is strongly on board for a strong agreement. There are important milestones leading up to that event, including the opening of the United Nations General Debate on September 24, 2014.\n\nNew research notes that 45 million Americans are alarmed about climate change and another 50 million Americans are concerned. But 40 percent of Americans believe that humans are not changing the climate. There is a significant failure of communications regarding the environment. Meanwhile, the profound decline in air quality in China has caused a significant shift in public opinion, Sachs said.\n\nI made a strong case for private sector involvement in the process. Market-based solutions are the best path forward. Companies such as GE* have specific expertise in new forms of energy transmission and installation of electric charging stations. Pepsico* has 38 million friends of its various brands on social channels such as Facebook. Project Sunlight from Unilever* generated nearly 100 million views of a video on sustainability. I also suggested mobilization of youth groups such as One Young World.\n\nThe sad reality is that environment is often a political loser, with short-term pain for long-term gain. Imagine implementing carbon taxes at a time of weak employment in the West or insisting that India not implement new power plants based on low-cost coal. What is required is a vision of what is possible if COP 21 negotiations succeed. That is why an outside-in strategy, of pressuring politicians through mass consumer participation in the issue, plus pressure from business, is an essential approach.\n\nI go along with the comment by Keith Weed, CMO for Unilever. “Some people argue that in the future, everyone will just consume less. I see no evidence for that in consumer behavior… Growth needs to be sustainable economically meaning to grow our business but it must be sustainable environmentally and socially as well…What’s the business case for sustainability? I always answer, ‘I would love to see the business case for the alternative.’”",
