others were found in the industrial seaway packing 145mileanhour winds as it made landfall the storm left more than a million people in three states without power and submerged highways even hundreds of miles from its center the storm was potent enough to rank as one of the most punishing hurricanes ever to hit the united states insurance experts said that damage could exceed 9 billion which would make it one of the costliest storms on record in new orleans most of the levees held but one was damaged floodwaters rose to rooftops in one neighborhood and in many areas emergency workers pulled residents from roofs the hurricanes howling winds stripped 15foot sections off the roof of the superdome where as many as 10000 evacuees took shelter some of the worst damage reports came from east of

extensive assistance for hurricane victims and the federal emergency management agency was expected to be working in the area for months assessing damage to properties and allocating what is likely to be billions of dollars in aid to homeowners and businesses in alabama louisiana and mississippi the governors declared search and rescue their top priority but they said high waters and strong winds were keeping them from that task particularly in the hardesthit areas the governors sent out the police and the national guard after reports of looting and officials in some parts of louisiana said they would impose a curfew hurricane katrina was downgraded from category 5 the most dangerous storm to category 4 as it hit land in eastern louisiana just after 6 am and in new orleans officials said the storms slight shift to the east had spared them somewhat the city is below sea level and there had been predictions that the historic french quarter would be under 18 or 20 feet of water still no one was finding much comfort here with 100 mph winds and water surges of up to 15 feet officials said early in the day that more than 20 buildings had been toppled i cant say that weve escaped the worst gov kathleen babineaux blanco said i think there is still damage that can be inflicted on the city we dont even know what the worst is preliminary damage estimates from the hurricane which raked across southern florida last week as a category 1 storm before reaching the warm waters of the gulf of mexico and making its run at the gulf coast ranged from 9 billion to 16 billion only hurricane andrew which ripped through parts of florida louisiana and mississippi in august 1992 was costlier with nearly 21 billion in insured losses beyond the property damage caused by flooding and the high winds hurricane katrina also dealt a blow to the oil industry and the lucrative casinos that have been the economic engine for the region both oil production on offshore platforms and gambling in the string of casinos that dot the mississippi gulf coast shut down on sunday as the storm approached since friday oil output in the gulf of mexico has been cut by 31 million barrels closing the casinos cost mississippi 400000 to 500000 a day in lost tax revenue alone and mr barbour said officials had not yet been able to determine the extent of damage to the casinos the storm pounded new orleans for eight hours straight flooding overwhelmed levees built to protect the city from the mississippi river and lake pontchartrain sending muddy water swirling into the narrow streets downtown on the

saturday in anticipation of the hurricane according to entergy nuclear which owns all three the extent of damage to the plant that shut down waterford 20 miles west of new orleans was still unknown

and officials estimated that 40000 homes too were flooded parish officials reported in early afternoon that many residents had been driven to their roofs officials estimated 80 percent of new orleans residents had obeyed the order to evacuate but in areas that had been expecting less damage officials were worried and annoyed that large numbers of people tried to ride out the storm in plaquemines

life said state senator walter j boasso we have a lot of people down there hiding in their attics and i dont know if we will get to them fast enough in mississippi mr barbour said many people suffered

sandbagged doors and windows at the mobile museum water all but covered a number of street signs and parking meters and large heavy planters and some newspaper boxes floated down the streets the main

            "text": "NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 29 - Hurricane Katrina pounded the Gulf Coast with devastating force at daybreak on Monday, sparing New Orleans the catastrophic hit that had been feared but inundating parts of the city and heaping damage on neighboring Mississippi, where it killed dozens, ripped away roofs and left coastal roads impassable.\n\nOfficials said that according to preliminary reports, there were at least 55 deaths, with 50 alone in Harrison County, Miss., which includes Gulfport and Biloxi. Emergency workers feared that they would find more dead among people who had been trapped in their homes and in collapsed buildings.\n\nJim Pollard, a spokesman for the Harrison County emergency operations center, said many of the dead were found in an apartment complex in Biloxi. Seven others were found in the Industrial Seaway.\n\nPacking 145-mile-an-hour winds as it made landfall, the storm left more than a million people in three states without power and submerged highways even hundreds of miles from its center.\n\nThe storm was potent enough to rank as one of the most punishing hurricanes ever to hit the United States. Insurance experts said that damage could exceed $9 billion, which would make it one of the costliest storms on record.\n\nIn New Orleans, most of the levees held, but one was damaged. Floodwaters rose to rooftops in one neighborhood, and in many areas emergency workers pulled residents from roofs. The hurricane's howling winds stripped 15-foot sections off the roof of the Superdome, where as many as 10,000 evacuees took shelter.\n\nSome of the worst damage reports came from east of New Orleans with an estimated 40,000 homes reported flooded in St. Bernard Parish. In Gulfport, the storm left three of five hospitals without working emergency rooms, beachfront homes wrecked and major stretches of the coastal highway flooded and unpassable.\n\n\"It came on Mississippi like a ton of bricks,\" Gov. Haley Barbour said at a midday news conference \"It's a terrible storm.\"\n\nPresident Bush promised extensive assistance for hurricane victims, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency was expected to be working in the area for months, assessing damage to properties and allocating what is likely to be billions of dollars in aid to homeowners and businesses.\n\nIn Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, the governors declared search and rescue their top priority, but they said high waters and strong winds were keeping them from that task, particularly in the hardest-hit areas.\n\nThe governors sent out the police and the National Guard after reports of looting, and officials in some parts of Louisiana said they would impose a curfew.\n\nHurricane Katrina was downgraded from Category 5 - the most dangerous storm - to Category 4 as it hit land in eastern Louisiana just after 6 a.m., and in New Orleans officials said the storm's slight shift to the east had spared them somewhat. The city is below sea level, and there had been predictions that the historic French Quarter would be under 18 or 20 feet of water.\n\nStill, no one was finding much comfort here, with 100 m.p.h. winds and water surges of up to 15 feet. Officials said early in the day that more than 20 buildings had been toppled.\n\n\"I can't say that we've escaped the worst,\" Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said. \"I think there is still damage that can be inflicted on the city. We don't even know what the worst is.\"\n\nPreliminary damage estimates from the hurricane - which raked across southern Florida last week as a Category 1 storm before reaching the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and making its run at the Gulf Coast - ranged from $9 billion to $16 billion. Only Hurricane Andrew, which ripped through parts of Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi in August 1992, was costlier - with nearly $21 billion in insured losses.\n\nBeyond the property damage caused by flooding and the high winds, Hurricane Katrina also dealt a blow to the oil industry and the lucrative casinos that have been the economic engine for the region. Both oil production on offshore platforms and gambling in the string of casinos that dot the Mississippi Gulf Coast shut down on Sunday as the storm approached.\n\nSince Friday, oil output in the Gulf of Mexico has been cut by 3.1 million barrels. Closing the casinos cost Mississippi $400,000 to $500,000 a day in lost tax revenue alone, and Mr. Barbour said officials had not yet been able to determine the extent of damage to the casinos.\n\nThe storm pounded New Orleans for eight hours straight. Flooding overwhelmed levees built to protect the city from the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, sending muddy water swirling into the narrow streets downtown. On the southern shore of the lake, entire neighborhoods of one-story homes were flooded to the rooflines, with nearby off-ramps for Interstate 10 looking like boat ramps amid the waves.\n\nAlong the lake were snapped telephone poles, trees blocking roads and live wires scattered over the roads. In one cabin, a family was cooking a chicken dinner over charcoal briquettes on a hibachi. They had lost power like everyone else in the area.\n\nWindows were blown off condominiums, hotels, office buildings and Charity Hospital, sending chards of glass into the winds. Fires broke out despite torrential rain, some ignited, the authorities said, by residents who lighted candles after the electricity went out.\n\nThe storm knocked out telephone and cellular service across swaths of the gulf region, and officials in New Orleans said parts of the city could remain without power for weeks.\n\nTwo nuclear plants near the path of Hurricane Katrina appear to have weathered the storm without major damage, and a third shut down on Saturday, in anticipation of the hurricane, according to Entergy Nuclear, which owns all three. The extent of damage to the plant that shut down, Waterford, 20 miles west of New Orleans, was still unknown late Monday afternoon because the wind was blowing too hard to go out and look, said Diane Park, a spokeswoman.\n\nThe more sparsely populated parishes east of New Orleans, meanwhile, got hit much harder than anyone had expected.\n\nMs. Blanco said Plaquemines, Orleans, St. Bernard, Jefferson and St. Tammany Parishes had been \"devastated by high winds and floodwaters.\" In St. Bernard, the emergency center was submerged, and officials estimated that 40,000 homes, too, were flooded.\n\nParish officials reported in early afternoon that many residents had been driven to their roofs.\n\nOfficials estimated 80 percent of New Orleans residents had obeyed the order to evacuate.

But casino workers could not reach them to survey the damage, he said, because U.S. 90 had \"essentially been destroyed.\"\n\nAlong the coast in Mobile, Ala., 150 miles east of New Orleans, thousands of evacuees from Mississippi and Louisiana were filling shelters and the hotels that had remained open.\n\nThe lowest-lying areas of Mobile and Baldwin Counties in Alabama were evacuated on Sunday night. By noon, areas south of Interstate 10 were already flooding, and the storm surge was pushing the water toward the city of Mobile and Mobile Bay as the hurricane progressed.\n\nDowntown Mobile, which is right on the bay, was severely flooded by Monday afternoon, the water pushing down the main streets around the county courthouse and lapping at the sandbagged doors and windows at the Mobile Museum. Water all but covered a number of street signs and parking meters, and large, heavy planters and some newspaper boxes floated down the streets.\n\nThe main hotels in the city were just a block or two from the worst flooding, causing concerns that they, too, would be flooded, at least in the main floors.

The island was already flooding on Sunday afternoon.\n\nLike most storms, Hurricane Katrina weakened as it came onshore, and by Monday evening the National Hurricane Center had downgraded it to a tropical storm. The center of the storm had moved its heavy rains toward Jackson, Miss.\n\nBut state officials said the hurricane had been an unusually large one, causing a wide swath of damage, and they expected to be dealing with damage for days if not weeks.\n\nIn Louisiana, Ms. Blanco pleaded with residents who had evacuated not to rush back.\n\n\"The roads are flooded, the power is out, the phones are down and there is no food or water, and many trees are down,\" she said.\n\n\"Wherever you live, it is still too dangerous for people to return home,\" she continued. \"If you evacuated and you're in a shelter, if you're with friends and family, please, please stay there. Stay safe.\"\n\nMichael D. Brown, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, reminded people that most injuries from hurricanes occurred after the storm had passed.\n\n\"Be careful,\" Mr. Brown said, standing next to the governor at a news conference. \"Don't get in that water. Watch for downed power lines. If you're going to use a chainsaw, know how to use a chainsaw. If you're going to have a generator, know how to exercise and operate the generator. Be very, very careful. The storm is not over.\"\n\nMr. Brown also discouraged fire and emergency agencies outside the storm area from sending in crews unless they had been asked.\n\nEven before the hurricane hit the New Orleans area, FEMA had positioned 23 of its disaster medical assistance teams and 7 search and rescue teams around the region. It also delivered generators, and stockpiles of water, ice and ready-to-eat meals. It even sent in two teams of veterinarians to provide care to any injured pets or other animals.\n\nAs of early Monday, about 52,000 people were in 240 shelters in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida and Texas, with the majority in the Superdome in New Orleans.\n\nJoseph B.

house majority leaderso we hear our long national nightmare is over so does so does this count as a correction i dont know whether to update the stats or not the tv watch column on sept 5 discussed broadcast journalists undisguised outrage at the failings of hurricane katrina rescue efforts it said reporters had helped stranded victims because no police officers or rescue workers were around and added foxs geraldo rivera did his rivals one better yesterday he nudged an air force rescue worker out of the way so his camera crew could tape him as he helped lift an older woman in a wheelchair to safety the editors understood the nudge comment as the television critics figurative reference to mr riveras flamboyant intervention mr rivera complained but after reviewing a tape of his broadcast the times declined to publish a correction numerous readers howevernow including byron calame the newspapers public editor who also scrutinized the taperead the comment as a factual assertion the times acknowledges that no nudge was visible on the broadcast aside from the obvious reaction that this reads like the sort of thing i say to aside from the obvious reaction that this readslike the sort of thing i say to highpitched tone just to end a fight that was totally her faulti acknowledge that if i had listened to your driving directions we would have gotten home two hours sooner i have three things to say 1 i wonder where anyone got the idea that newspapers are arrogant stuffy insular institutions utterly lacking in selfawareness 2 so i guess geraldo doesnt count as a reader and 3 if you people would stop insisting on reading simple declarative sentences that describe the actions of named individuals as factual assertions that would be really great thanks its actually beginning to get a brief article in the new season issue on sept 11 about the abc series commander in chief starring geena davis misstated the surname of her character at one point she is mackenzie allen not adams thanks its actually beginning to get tedious thanks alex i dont want to seem like im piling on and i fully acknowledge that i have made and do make and will continue in the future to make stupid errors there but for the grace of god glass houses etc just television review yesterday about the apprentice martha stewart on nbc misstated the name of the recently incarcerated hosts daughter it is alexis not alexa gawker also tweaks her for some other fuzzier miscues like cleaning up a line of dialogue to make it sound well whiter that strikes me as beside the point the thing about stanleys current streak is that you dont really need to stretch to find something incorrect the alexis correction will knock her up to a solid 15 percent error rate for the past 12 months like i say i myself am a fairly wrong person whenever i get really wrong this since some folks have questioned the methodology i am bad at math so i kept it simple i took the number of corrections and divided by number of bylines the error rate does not represent the proportion of facts promulgated by stanley in her stories that turn out to be incorrect nor does it represent the number of errors she makes relative to the number of storiesif a three errors are mentioned in one correction for instance it still only counts as one correction the error rate simply represents the number of stanley stories requiring a correction of some sort relative to the number of stanley stories in total if you would like to get more algebraic on herby counting out the actual number of errors or the actual number of facts she advancesby all means be my guest i dont want to seem like im piling on and i fully acknowledge that i have made and do make and will continue in the future to make stupid errors there but for the grace of god glass houses etc just yesterday i mispelled martin scorseses name on this very blog but it seems pretty clear to me that alessandra stanley is in some sort of errorspiral gawker flags tomorrows correction todaygawker also tweaks her for some other fuzzier miscues like cleaning up a line of dialogue to make it sound well whiter that strikes me as beside the point the thing about stanleys current streak is that you dont really need to stretch to find something incorrect the alexis correction will knock her up to a solid 15 percent error rate for the past 12 monthslike i say i myself am a fairly wrong person whenever i get really wrong this shearwater tune always cheers me up i offer it here for alexandra or allesandra or alessandra whatever tal daniel mitnick born

television criticism yesterday offering up ebert joins a chorus of critical praise for the doc which is part of a major promotional campaign for dylan inc‚Äîhes got two albums of for ebert it was a revelation he was always a dylan fan but thought he was pretty much an asshole after seeing da pennebakers dont look back before seeing that movie in 1968 ebert had always thought of dylan as a lone ethical figure standing up against the phonies but pennebaker unmasked him as in eberts words immature petty vindictive lacking a sense of humor overly impressed with his own importance and not very bright but ebert was won over by no direction home which creates a portrait that is deep sympathetic perceptive and yet finally leaves dylan shrouded in mystery which is where he properly lives well gosh i wonder how that could have happened maybe it has something to do with the fact that jeff rosen dylans manager is a producer of the documentary and that rosen or people hired by him conducted the interviews‚Äî ‚Äîthat appear in the film so that when joan baez or allen ginsberg or pete seeger or dylan himself appear on camera they are answering questions posed by people hired to advance dylans interests and create a deep sympathetic portrait of him and his legacy which isnt to say that its not a great film or worthy of four stars i havent seen it but it is‚Äîin its entirety‚Äîa production of bob dylan and people paid by bob dylan every frame of it is owned by bob dylan theyre his archives he commissioned the interviews i know all this because i incredulously questioned the producers about it at a press event i attended on the film back in january its unavoidably a massive selfblowjob so why have so many critics‚Äîand i dont mean to single out ebert who does mention without seeming to mind rosens involvement in the picture‚Äîelevated this glorified video press release to the level of film because it was nominally directed by martin scorsese which is bullshit it was by martin scorsese rosen and dylan began planning the film years ago long before scorcese was attached when they realized that many seminal figures who have interesting things to say about dylan were dying off so they made sure to get for instance ginsbergs recollections down on film before he died they hired the crews conducted the interviews went through dylans film archives picked the stuff they wanted released kept private the things they wanted private and handed it over to scorcese to stitch together at such a time as it was convenient to their promotional needs again im sure its a fascinating film and im sure its worthy of praise but every word was vetted or produced by dylan and his camp which certainly ought to be a caution to critics and at the very least ought to raise questions about why pbs is financing and distributing it at the aforementioned press event for the film scorsese said he may still go back and reinterview dylan himself but not because he wanted to ask more probing or interesting questionshe had some issues with the sound and intellegibility of some of the reels that had been handed to him to direct i dont know if he ever did freshen any of the interviews up but it hardly matters its still phony roger ebert bigfooted himself over to television criticism yesterday offering up four glowing stars for no direction home the forthcoming pbs documentary about bob dylan directed by martin scorseseebert joins a chorus of critical praise for the doc which is part of a major promotional campaign for dylan inc‚Äîhes got two albums of live and previously unreleased material coming out along with the paperback edition of chronicles vol 1 and an official scrapbook ‚Äîand many many folks have swooned over the intimate epic hollywood reporter which traces dylans evolution from earnest folkie to diffident folkrockerfor ebert it was a revelation he was always a dylan fan but thought he was pretty much an asshole after seeing da pennebakers dont look back before seeing that movie in 1968 ebert had always thought of dylan as a lone ethical figure standing up against the phonies but pennebaker unmasked him as in eberts words immature petty vindictive lacking a sense of humor overly impressed with his own importance and not very brightbut ebert was won over by no direction home which creates a portrait that is deep sympathetic perceptive and yet finally leaves dylan shrouded in mystery which is where he properly liveswell gosh i wonder how that could have happened maybe it has something to do with the fact that jeff rosen dylans

by writing that he nudged an air force rescue worker out of the way so his camera crew could tape him as he helped lift an older woman in a wheelchair to safety in new orleansthe tape clearly shows that rivera did no such thing and was in fact just helping carry a woman in a wheelchairrosenthal took a trip down memory lane to revisit some of stanleys other errors which clearly burn inside his eyelids when he goes to sleep each nighti immediately assumed that rosenthal merely had it in for stanley a star of sorts on the tv beat who inspired envy among some critics until a couple months ago rosenthal was the suntimes tv critic so i nexised bylinealessandra stanley and correction appended andmy the woman is clocking corrections at more than a monthly rate and they are stupid stupid errors

owing to a stronglyworded letter from the us olympic committees lawyers held a 25th anniversary show in chicago starring mike myers andy richter amy poehler and other improv leading lights howd it go depends who you ask heres chris jones in the chicago tribune at saturday nights disastrous 25th anniversary show for improvolympic the freewheeling ubercasual intensely creative atmosphere of chicago improv ran slap up against the perfectly reasonable expectations of people attending a big 3500seat downtown venue ponying up as much as 75 a ticket and expecting that someone somewhere might have thought for a moment or two about their needs the problem jones wrote was a jawdropping lack of technical planning and a sound failure of catastrophic proportions the chicago daily herald agreed a collective cringe gripped the audience as io theater alumni struggled with faulty body mics during the star studded 25th anniversary salute to the scrappy chicago improv theater founded by charna halpern and indelibly imprinted by the late master del close sans sound the evening sputtered and stalled but new york times freelancer david bernstein had a sunnier take on the proceedings it seemed like a bad joke the 3500seat chicago theater was packed for the 25th anniversary reunion show of improvolympic last saturday an event that had brought together an allstar array of comedians including mike myers andy dick andy richter mo collins and tim meadows and then the microphones went dead fortunately mr myers who spent eight months in the late 1980s at improvolympic the theater school and performance space here and the other alumni on hand applied what they had learned at their beloved alma mater they improvised the show was delayed about an hour and the performers who included the saturday night live repertory players amy poehler rachel dratch and horatio sanz and the upright citizens brigade comedy troupe had to resort to handheld microphones with mixed success not everyone could hear their routines easily still the show still got plenty of laughs granted the tribune and daily herald pieces were reviews whereas bernsteins was a story about io pegged to the event including plenty of backstage cigarettesneaking with rachel dratch but he did gloss over what other observers described as nearly fatal sound problems and i guess bernstein was too busy hanging backstage to notice as jones did the throngs who demanded their money back at intermission in the lobby it was an ugly scene you guys are starting to yell and scream now improvised the harassed scott shiller a theater official in the firing line i need you to step away from me so what could explain the different takes i dont know but some guy named jacob who wrote about the new york times story on the improvchicago dave the reporter also took classes at ioc and performed some before his current gig at nyt hats off to him for getting to do the piece hats off to nyt for sending someone who might know a thing or two about improv and what we do to cover the story tribune probably just thought we were friends of the mayor and we all know how much they love the mayor because i dont believe anything i read on the internets and because i have a daunting deadline approaching and desperately require distraction from certain unpleasant and inevitable realities i called bernstein to confirm that he did in fact take classes at io and performed there two years ago while he was in journalism school at medill i basically got kicked off the team he said when school took up too much of his time i wasnt writing a review bernstein told me i was writing a feature on the theater itself it was in my lede that the show had problems if i wrote that it was the worst show in the world people would have said it was because i got cut fair enough which is a pretty good reason why he shouldnt be writing about the improvolympic now heres what id call a conflict of interest on saturday august

fanatic writer matt mcguire inexplicably and repeatedly started referring to portastatics new record the good news mac mccaughans portastatic got a nice big writeup in the chicago tribune on friday in advance of friday nights show at the empty bottlewhich by the way was loud and rocking and absolutely phenomenal but then again you knew id say thatthe bad news which i mention only because im a fanatic writer matt mcguire inexplicably and repeatedly started referring to portastatics new record bright ideas as bright eyes about halfway through the piece as mac said to me before the show if hed called it bright eyes it certainly would have sold better how do you like this for a story in fridays tempo section about oprah winfreys visit to hurricanestricken new orleans contained comparisons of winfrey to president bush that were unfavorable to bush the tribune failed to disclose that the writer was a contributor to the presidential campaign last year of bushs opponent sen john kerry dmass tribune standards require disclosure of any such conflict of interest thats from saturdays chicago tribune and the reporter in question is my former colleague maureen ryan evidence of her political leanings can be found anyway i guess it was all cleared up and ryan was told to keep her money to herself from now on but it looks like that disclosure will be appended to every story she writes from here on out that comes anywhere near politics which is pretty stupid i dont think reporters ought to be publicly aligning themselves with political parties which is what a donation really amounts to since the logs are publicly available but its not as the correction says a conflict of interest to do so a conflict of interest is when someone has more than one interest and two or more of those interests are in conflict with each other take for example a newspaper editor lets say this newspaper editor has a professional interest in seeing to it that his or her newspaper aggressively and fairly reports on the doings of an enormous media and entertainment in ryans case there is no conflict her political donations dont constitute an interest in the election of a democrat to the office of president they a preexisting interest you cant fault ryan for holding partisan political views the problem with her donations is that they announce those views to anyone who cares to look through a donor database thereby giving ammunition to anyone who wants to attack the tribunes credibility and inviting unwanted scrutiny of her work and by publishing a wellintentioned clarification the tribune merely compounded the problem and made far more people aware of ryans political allegiances than were aware before how do you like this for a correction thats from saturdays chicago tribune and the reporter in question is my former colleague maureen ryan evidence of her political leanings can be found here a full search at fecinfocom comes up with a total of 4000 in political giving last year i was at the tribune when word of ryans donationswhich clearly violated the tribs ethics policystarted going around after im told a reporter happened across them during a database search there was no question who it was since she listed her employer and occupation on the fec donor forms as tribune companywriter there was some correct tsktsking of what was clearly a boneheaded move on ryans part but the astonishing thing is that as it turns out she had gotten a signoff from her superiors before she made the donations also astonishing is the fact that someone on a hacks salary has 4000 lying around to give to the least compelling political candidate in modern history but thats another storyanyway i guess it was all cleared up and ryan was told to keep her money to herself from now on but it looks like that disclosure will be appended to every story she writes from here on out that comes anywhere near politicswhich is pretty stupid i dont think reporters ought to be publicly aligning themselves with political parties which is what a donation really amounts to since the logs are publicly available but its not as the correction says a conflict of interest to do so a conflict of interest is when someone has more than one interest and two or more of those interests are in conflict with each othertake for example a newspaper editor lets say this newspaper editor has a professional interest in seeing to it that his or her newspaper aggressively and fairly reports on the doings of an enormous media and entertainment conglomerate that reaches tens of millions of people through its newspapers television stations and sports teams and lets say this newspaper editor also has an interest in seeing his or her retirement account which consists in large part of stock and options to purchase stock at a reduced price in the aforementioned media and entertainment conglomerate continue to grow in value and lets further say that this newspaper editors future at the newspaper and the company that owns the newspaper depends in large part on decisions made by executives at the amentioned media and entertainment conglomerate in such an instance a conflict of interest would obtain each time our hypothetical newspaper editor made a decision about how to cover the aforementioned media and entertainment conglomerate the editors professional interest in fair and aggressive coverage could conflict with his or her personal interest in career advancement and a secure retirement so thats a conflict of interest i dont recall ever seeing any conflicts like that one disclosed in the pages of the tribunein ryans case there is no conflict her political donations dont constitute an interest in the election of a democrat to the office of president theya preexisting interest you cant fault ryan for holding partisan political views the problem with her donations is that they announce those views to anyone who cares to look through a donor database thereby giving ammunition to anyone who wants to attack the tribunes credibility and inviting unwanted scrutiny of her work and by publishing a wellintentioned clarification the tribune

the washington post in its tuesday aug 30 edition the paper produced a shallow day 1 account of the storm reaching the conclusion that new orleans had averted disaster but the city managed to avoid the worst of the worst the mississippi river did not breach new orleanss famed levees to any serious degree at least in part because katrina veered 15 miles eastward of its predicted track just before landfall read the lead story and to judge from the post there was no crisis brewing on the evacuation front either those who remained behind were mostly visitors and tourists trapped because the airport had closed according to the same story by contrast new orleans most of the levees held but one was damaged floodwaters rose to rooftops in one neighborhood and in many areas emergency workers pulled residents from roofs the hurricanes howling winds stripped 15foot sections off the roof of the superdome where as many as 10000 evacuees took shelter i cant say that weve escaped the worst gov kathleen babineaux blanco said i think there is still damage that can be inflicted on the city we dont even know what the worst is the other day our friends over at wonkette wasted a little time trying to figure out exactly which newspapers chertoff and brown were reading last week that gave them an indication that new orleans dodged a bullet the morning after katrina made landfall wonkette surmised that the headlines were in a white house internal newsletter of some sortanother headline from that mornings edition baghdad citizens endorse constitution and personal retirement accountsit turns out the truth is much simpler they were reading the washington post here s the city papers erik wemple and jason cherkis via romenesko by contrast here s what the new york times had that morning george bush care about black people how else to explain disaster prep is and mitigation is important to our agency also update i guess crooks liars george bushcare about black people how else to explain this fema for kidz rap on the agencys web site and do we need to spell it out any more clearly that bush chertoff and brown cant fairly be held responsible for the failure of local and state authorities to prepare for katrina i mean come oni mean jeez if these people wont listen when you speak to them in their own language then whats a government supposed to doalso found on the fema for kidz page we still dont know for sure what newspaper chertoff was reading that told him new orleans dodged a bullet but we think little katie sullivan is the editorial cartoonistupdate i guess crooks liars noted this over the weekend the soft bigotry of no preparations george bush master of meeting with red cross officials in washington sunday president bush on sunday thanked the agencys nearly 5000 volunteers working at shelters in 19 states helping displaced louisiana residents and promised victims a tidal wave of compassion george bush master of wordcraft bush continued america is sending roving armed gangs of love to help the good people of new orleans and loot them of their misery we will shower them with the dysentery of human kindness and spread the feces of safety around the floor where they sleep i literally cant get away from these people ive been watching the but evan cohen ive been watching the outrage over air america and the gloria wise boys girls club loan from afar and

The TV Watch column on Sept. 5 discussed broadcast journalists' undisguised outrage at the failings of Hurricane Katrina rescue efforts. It said reporters had helped stranded victims because no police officers or rescue workers were around, and added, \"Fox's Geraldo Rivera did his rivals one better: yesterday, he nudged an Air Force rescue worker out of the way so his camera crew could tape him as he helped lift an older woman in a wheelchair to safety.\" The editors understood the \"nudge\" comment as the television critic's figurative reference to Mr. Rivera's flamboyant intervention. Mr. Rivera complained, but after reviewing a tape of his broadcast, The Times declined to publish a correction. Numerous readers, however--now including Byron Calame, the newspaper's public editor, who also scrutinized the tape--read the comment as a factual assertion. The Times acknowledges that no nudge was visible on the broadcast.

And the murder of a journalist, or anyone, for that matter, shouldn't really be an occasion for snarkery.So it is in all earnestness that I ask: If Judith Miller's detention was front page news, why was Haider's death stuffed on Page 10? Which reporter sacrificed more for the New York Times? And which story--reporters who work for American papers being hunted and killed in Iraq for reporting accurately on Shiite militias, or reporters being jailed in America for not divulging information about sources who have signed statements releasing all obligations of anonymity--is more important?

It is \"Everybody Loves Raymond,\" not \"All About Raymond.\" . (Thanks This one had to hurt: Monitoring school-halls since 1984 . (Thanks Eric .) has been getting surprisingly positive coverage. My question for This has been getting surprisingly positive coverage. My question for Kevin Sites is this: Do you really want to risk your life covering war zones for a company with an exclamation point in its name? Speaking of one reporter \n\n If nothing else, the incident recalls some of Stanley's more colorful gaffes. We all make mistakes--especially me--but Stanley's pieces have had doozies.\n\n\n\nThe Times has issued corrections to point out that the WB is not a cable network and Fox's short-lived hotel soap \"North Shore\" was not a program about the sex industry. Another piece, according to the correction, \"misstated the political backdrop of the economic recession that preceded the good times that were the setting of `Friends.'\" I immediately assumed that Rosenthal merely had it in for Stanley, a star of sorts on the TV beat who inspired envy among some critics (until a couple months ago, Rosenthal was the Sun-Times' TV critic). So I Nexised \"(byline)Alessandra Stanley and correction appended\" and--my . The woman is clocking corrections at more than a monthly rate. And they are stupid, stupid errors. Still, somehow I don't get the sense that anybody's writing any \"we have to stop Alessandra Stanley from writing for the Times--now\" memos.\n\n\n\nSo herewith, for your reading pleasure: The Collected Corrections of Alessandra Stanley, with Grateful Acknowledgement to Phil Rosenthal for Getting the Ball Rolling. (In the interest of brevity, I only went back to 2001, when Stanley started writing incorrect things about television, and I made them really tiny. In Stanley's defense, her overall correction rate for that period is a not-quite-appalling-but-still-kinda-large 11 percent--she's got an 89 percent chance of being right! Her rate for the past year is a disconcerting 14 percent, or a one-in-seven chance of being wrong.)\n\n August 9, 2005\n\nThe TV Watch column in The Arts yesterday, about the legacy of Peter Jennings, misstated the name of the network where he started his career. It is the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, not Company.\n\n\n\nJuly 27, 2005\n\nA television review on July 27 about ''Over There,'' a show on the FX cable channel portraying the fighting in Iraq, referred incorrectly to the gold star flags that were displayed by the families of Americans killed in past wars. Some are indeed flown by survivors in the current war.\n\n\n\nJune 3, 2005\n\nThe TV Weekend column last Friday, about mock reality shows including the new HBO series ''The Comeback,'' referred imprecisely to Michael Patrick King, an executive producer of that series, and his involvement in ''Sex and the City.'' HBO says he was an executive producer of ''Sex and the City'' and ''a leading creative contributor''; Darren Star was credited as the creator.\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2005\n\nA television review last Monday about ''Faith of My Fathers,'' a movie on A&E based on Senator John McCain's memoir about his experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, misstated the rarity of fathers and sons who have held four-star ranks in the United States military. Senator McCain's grandfather and father are not the only ones; at least three other sets of fathers and sons have held that distinction.\n\n\n\nMay 1, 2005\n\nThe television report on the Week Ahead page last Sunday, about the return of ''Family Guy'' to the Fox network, misspelled the surname of its creator and misidentified a cable channel that carried reruns after Fox canceled the show in 2002. He is Seth MacFarlane, not McFarlane; the channel was the Cartoon Network, not Comedy Central.\n\n\n\nMay 1, 2005\n\nAn article on May 1 about Mustique, in the Caribbean, referred incorrectly to a meal included in the room rate of the Cotton House, the island's one hotel. It is afternoon tea. (High tea, served chiefly in Britain, is a more substantial early-evening meal.)\n\n\n\nApril 24, 2005\n\nAn article last Sunday about Pope Benedict XVI's record of disciplinary actions against theologians while he was prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith misstated the timing of the Protestant Reformation, set off by Martin Luther. It began in 1517; it was not ''more than 500'' years ago.\n\n\n\nAn article on April 24 about Pope Benedict XVI's record of disciplinary actions against theologians while was prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith incorrectly described the population of Poland when Pope John Paul II was born in 1920. According to the 1921 census, an estimated 14 percent of the population was Jewish or Protestant. The country was not almost 100 percent Catholic.\n\n\n\nApril 10, 2005\n\nThe TV Watch column on Sunday, about American television coverage of the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, misidentified the cable network that carries the talk show of one commentator, Tina Brown. It is CNBC, not MSNBC.\n\n\n\nMarch 30, 2005\n\nA picture caption yesterday with a television review of ''Eyes,'' a detective series on ABC, misidentified the actress shown. She was Laura Leighton, who plays a lawyer, not Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon, who plays an investigator.\n\n\n\nThe review referred incorrectly to an earlier series, ''Wings,'' that featured Tim Daly, the star of ''Eyes.'' It was his last hit series; ''The Fugitive'' was his last series over all.\n\n\n\nMarch 4, 2005\n\nThe TV Weekend column yesterday, about ''The Starlet,'' referred to the WB network incorrectly. It is a broadcast network, not cable.\n\n\n\nMarch 4, 2005\n\nA television review in Weekend on March 4 about ''Deadwood,'' an HBO series created by David Milch, omitted the co-creator of ''NYPD Blue,'' another series Mr. Milch developed. He is Steven Bochco.\n\n\n\nDecember 3, 2004\n\nA brief television review in Weekend on Friday about the 1957 CBS broadcast of ''Cinderella,'' by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, which starred Julie Andrews and is being shown on PBS stations this month, credited another Broadway musical to the composer-lyricist team erroneously. ''My Fair Lady'' is by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe.\n\n\n\nOctober 20, 2004\n\nThe TV Watch column on Wednesday, about a televised dispute between broadcast personalities -- Jon Stewart of ''The Daily Show'' versus Paul Begala and Tucker Carlson of ''Crossfire'' -- referred erroneously to a past example from an era when famous people clashed bitterly and at length on the air. Mary McCarthy indeed criticized Lillian Hellman on ''The Dick Cavett Show'' in 1980, but Hellman was not present.\n\n\n\nOctober 11, 2004\n\nA television review on Monday about ''The Choice 2004'' on PBS and ''Diary of a Political Tourist'' on HBO, written, directed and produced by Alexandra Pelosi, misstated the title of a documentary Ms. Pelosi made about the 2000 Bush campaign. It was ''Journeys With George,'' not ''Travels With George.''\n\n\n\nOctober 9, 2004\n\nA TV Watch column in some late editions on Saturday about the televised debate between President Bush and Senator John Kerry misstated a comparison of the number of times the two candidates addressed questioners in the audience by name. While Mr. Kerry responded to 10 out of 18 by name, Mr. Bush addressed two questioners -- not none -- that way.\n\n\n\nOctober 5, 2004\n\nA television review on Tuesday about ''Tanner on Tanner,'' a mock documentary on the Sundance channel, misstated the number of episodes. There are four, not three. A listing with the review included an erroneous credit. Jacob Craycroft edited the shows alone, not with Peter Sassi. (A short excerpt from a film edited by Mr. Sassi is shown in the series.)\n\n\n\nOctober 1, 2004\n\nThe TV Watch column in some copies yesterday, about the presidential candidates' body language in their first debate, misidentified a political commentator who said on Fox News that the polls would tighten a bit after the event. It was Ceci Connolly of The Washington Post, not Fred Barnes of The Weekly Standard.\n\n\n\nSeptember 14, 2004\n\nA television review on Tuesday about ''R-Rated: Republicans in Hollywood,'' an AMC documentary about politics and the movie industry, referred incorrectly to the box office performance of ''The Day After Tomorrow,'' a feature film with a global warming theme. Its domestic receipts totaled $186.4 million, and its worldwide sales $540.4 million, according to Variety.com; it was not a flop.\n\n\n\nThe review also misspelled the given name of the actor who was a lone gun spokesman in the pre-Reagan days. He is Charlton Heston, not Charleton.\n\n\n\nSeptember 3, 2004\n\nThe TV Watch column on Sept. 3, about coverage of the Republican National Convention by Fox News, misspelled the name of the playwright and diplomat whose bristly manner was likened to that of some Fox anchors. She was Clare Boothe Luce, not Claire Booth Luce.\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2004\n\nA television review on Wednesday about ''Hawaii,'' a new police drama on NBC, misstated the subject of another show that is set in Hawaii, ''North Shore'' on Fox. It is about a hotel that offers guests sexual favors, not about the sex industry.\n\n\n\nAugust 27, 2004\n\nA credit listing with a TV Watch article in Weekend on Aug. 27 about biographies of President Bush shown on CNN and MSNBC on the eve of the Republican National Convention omitted the executive producer of the MSNBC program, ''Brian Williams Reports -- ''George Bush: The Father's Footsteps.'' He was Andrew K. Franklin. (As the listing noted, Tammy Haddad was executive producer for MSNBC convention coverage.)\n\n\n\nJuly 23, 2004\n\nThe TV Watch column in Weekend yesterday gave an incorrect cable channel in some copies for ''John Kerry: Bringing the War Home,'' on Sunday night. It will be on MSNBC, as shown in the program listing, not on ESPN.\n\n\n\nJuly 7, 2004\n\nThe TV Watch column yesterday, about two new shows that mix reality television with movies, misidentified the contestant on one program, ''Ultimate Film Fanatic,'' who showed off a tinsel snowflake taken from the set of the movie ''The Wiz.'' He was Jordan (Steve was another contestant).\n\n\n\nJuly 2, 2004\n\nAn article in Weekend on July 2 about the Museum of Television and Radio in Manhattan misstated the year it opened. It began as the Museum of Broadcasting in 1976; 1991 was the year it moved to its present location under the new name. The article also misstated the title of the series in which the Stephen Sondheim musical 'Evening Primrose' was broadcast in 1966. It was ''ABC Stage 67,'' not ''Studio 67.''\n\n\n\nJune 7, 2004\n\nA TV Watch article on Monday about the season finale of ''The Sopranos'' on HBO misstated the outcome of an attack by the character Tony B. on his Korean boss in an earlier episode. The boss was injured, not killed. It also referred incorrectly to a member of Johnny Sack's mob killed by Tony B. He was not a captain.\n\n\n\nThe article also misstated a concern of Uncle Junior during a conversation with Tony Soprano, when Junior was fixated on a gift he had ordered for a sick friend. The issue was whether he had given the right address for the friend, not the right phone number.\n\n\n\nJune 4, 2004\n\nThe TV Watch column on June 4, about the 60th anniversary of D-Day, misstated the whereabouts of the German commander, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, when the Allies landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944. He was in Ulm, not in Berlin.\n\n\n\nIt also misstated the date of an interview in Normandy given to Walter Cronkite by the American commander, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, for ''D-Day Plus 20 Years'' on the ''CBS Reports'' series. (That error also occurred in an article last Monday about the commemoration of D-Day by various presidents.) The interview was in 1963; its first broadcast was in 1964.\n\n\n\nMay 18, 2004\n\nA TV Watch article on May 18 about ''Tell Me a Story: The Man Who Made '60 Minutes,' '' a look at the career of the producer Don Hewitt, referred incorrectly to the film of the Andrea Doria's sinking made by his CBS News crew in 1956. It did not show the only news images of the sinking. Harry Trask of The Boston Traveler also photographed it.\n\n\n\n\n\nA TV Watch column on May 18 about a CBS program on Don Hewitt, creator and executive producer of ''60 Minutes,'' misstated the amount of money that CBS paid H.R. Haldeman, former chief of staff to President Richard M. Nixon, for an interview in 1975. It was $100,000, not $1,000. The article also referred incorrectly to the interview, which was shown in two parts. While it was seen in the ''60 Minutes'' time slot, it was a CBS News special, not a ''60 Minutes'' program. A telephone message from a reader on May 18 pointed out the error about the payment. This correction was delayed by an editing lapse.\n\n\n\nMay 6, 2004\n\nA TV Watch article on May 6 about the end of the NBC series ''Friends'' and ''Frasier'' misstated the political backdrop of the economic recession that preceded the good times that were the setting of ''Friends.'' It occurred during George H. W. Bush's presidency, not also during Ronald Reagan's. The article also misstated the number of television actors who have matched Kelsey Grammer's record of playing the same character for 20 years. Besides James Arness, who played Matt Dillon on ''Gunsmoke,'' Milburn Stone played Doc Adams on that show for 20 years.\n\n\n\nApril 15, 2004\n\nThe TV Watch column in The Arts on Thursday, about two reality shows -- ''The Apprentice,'' created by Mark Burnett, and ''The Swan,'' created by Mike Darnell -- misidentified Mr. Darnell's partner in creating ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire.'' He was Mike Fleiss, not Mr. Burnett.\n\n\n\nApril 1, 2004\n\nA Critic's Notebook article on Thursday about the premiere of the liberal radio network Air America omitted the stations on which its programs are heard. They are WLIB-AM (1190) in New York, WNTD-AM (950) in Chicago, KBLA-AM (1580) in Los Angeles, KCAA-AM (1050) in Riverside and San Bernardino, Calif., KPOJ-AM (620) in Portland, Ore., and Channel 167 on XM Satellite Radio.\n\n\n\nA Critic's Notebook article on Thursday about the premiere of the liberal radio network Air America misstated the title given to Al Franken's program, as a parody of Bill O'Reilly's television program on Fox. It is ''The O'Franken Factor,'' not ''The O'Franken Report.''\n\n\n\nMarch 19, 2004\n\nThe TV Weekend review in Weekend on Friday, about the HBO series ''Deadwood,'' misstated the given name of the actor who plays Seth Bullock, a former Montana marshal. He is Timothy Olyphant, not Thomas.\n\n\n\nMarch 16, 2004\n\nA television review on March 16 about the CBS series ''Century City'' misattributed its creation. The creator is Ed Zuckerman. (Paul Attanasio and Katie Jacobs are executive producers, along with Mr. Zuckerman.)\n\n\n\nMarch 3, 2004\n\nA television review yesterday about ''Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital'' on ABC misidentified the country that originated the 1994 mini-series from which it was adapted. It was Denmark, not the Netherlands.\n\n\n\nJanuary 30, 2004\n\nThe TV Weekend column yesterday about the political comedian Dennis Miller and his new talk show referred incorrectly in some copies to the background of Adm. James Stockdale, whose performance as a vice-presidential candidate was a discussion topic. The admiral ran as an independent in 1992 with Ross Perot, not as a Republican in 1996 with John McCain, who was not a nominee.\n\n\n\nSeptember 26, 2003\n\nA TV Weekend review on Friday about three new CBS series misspelled the surname of the actor playing the heroine's father in \"Joan of Arcadia.\" He is Joe Mantegna, not Montegna.\n\n\n\nSeptember 22, 2003\n\nA listing of credits provided by NBC for a television review on Sept. 22 about the drama \"Las Vegas\" misidentified the composer. He was John Nordstrom; Gary Calamar was the music supervisor.\n\n\n\nJune 18, 2003\n\nThe TV Watch column on Wednesday, about shows in which people change their appearance, identity or home, misstated a word in the title of a recent movie about a character who slips the bonds of class and profession. It is \"Catch Me if You Can,\" not \"as You Can.\" The column also misidentified the teenager on the show \"Switched\" who asked \"Tepees and stuff?\" when told she was to switch places with a girl on an Indian reservation. She was Ally; Ida was the girl who lived on the reservation.\n\n\n\nMay 19, 2003\n\nA television review on May 19 about the NBC movie \"Martha Inc.: The Story of Martha Stewart\" misstated the native country of Ms. Stewart's father, Eddie Kostyra. While he was of Polish descent, he was born in New York. (This correction was delayed by an editing oversight.)\n\n\n\nMarch 18, 2003\n\nThe TV Watch article in some copies on Tuesday, about the tone of President Bush's address to the nation on war with Iraq, paraphrased his warning about war criminals incorrectly. He said: \"War crimes will be prosecuted. War criminals will be punished.\" He did not say the United States would prosecute them.\n\n\n\nMarch 6, 2003\n\nA listing of credits on Thursday with a television review of the first episode of the sitcom \"Oliver Beene\" misidentified the director and included an actor erroneously. The director was Michael Spiller; Jeff Melman has directed other episodes. Amy Castle was in the pilot film but not in the first episode.\n\n\n\nFebruary 6, 2003\n\nA television review yesterday about a \"20/20\" program on Michael Jackson misstated the time and date of the broadcast on ABC. It was 8 p.m. last night; the \"20/20\" program at 10 tonight is about women who batter men, and other topics.\n\n\n\nJanuary 12, 2003\n\nAn article last Sunday about reality television shows misstated the given name of the author of \"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,\" who confided his reluctance to publicly embarrass the impoverished farmers he was assigned to study. He was James Agee, not William.\n\n\n\nDecember 14, 2002\n\nThe TV Watch column on Saturday, about Al Gore's appearance as the host of \"Saturday Night Live,\" referred incompletely to the role of Steve Higgins, who said the former vice president had been game and affable behind the scenes. Besides writing skits, Mr. Higgins is the producer.\n\n\n\nNovember 7, 2002\n\nAn article on Nov. 7 about the background of Ted Savaglio, executive director of the Voter News Service, misstated the affiliations of two news executives who testified before Congress with Mr. Savaglio about the Florida presidential vote. The executives, Roger Ailes of Fox News and Andrew Heyward of CBS News, testified on behalf of their networks, not as members of the news service board.\n\n\n\nSeptember 2, 2002\n\nAn article in The Arts on Monday about \"Martin and Lewis,\" a movie about the comedy team to be shown on CBS in November, misstated the title of a Lewis film. It is \"The Bellboy,\" not \"The Bellhop.\"\n\n\n\nJuly 25, 2002\n\nAn article on Thursday about NBC's fall schedule referred incorrectly to the phrase \"gay mafia,\" which arose in a discussion of the absence of new gay characters in the networks' lineup. The term came to prominence recently when the Hollywood agent Michael S. Ovitz, in an interview in Vanity Fair, blamed a \"gay mafia\" for his own professional downfall; he did not say such a group ran the entertainment industry.\n\n\n\nJune 12, 2002\n\nA front-page article on Wednesday about memoirs written by servants and office assistants about their former employers misspelled the given name of a Hollywood producer who is working on a romantic comedy involving a haughty boss. The producer is Lynda Obst, not Linda.\n\n\n\nA front-page article last Wednesday reported a surge in the publishing of books written by subordinates about their bosses and cited the example of Richard Blow, who worked for John F. Kennedy Jr. at George magazine. The article said that immediately after Mr. Kennedy's death, Mr. Blow barred the magazine's staff members from talking to the media or writing about him.\n\n\n\nThe article should have described a disagreement over Mr. Blow's version of the events. He says that when he instructed employees not to discuss Mr. Kennedy, he told them that he was doing so at the request of the family. But four staff members dispute Mr. Blow's account. Stephanie Cutter, a spokeswoman for Senator Edward Kennedy, said it was \"highly unlikely\" that such a request had been made.\n\n\n\nJanuary 15, 2002\n\nAn article in Business Day yesterday about efforts by television networks to tailor news programs to young people misspelled the surname of the president of ABC News, who said he had learned from experience about overcatering to them. He is David Westin, not Weston. The article also misidentified the CBS News program on which Rebecca Rankin, a reporter for the music network VH1, has appeared. It is \"48 Hours,\" not \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n\n\nOctober 12, 2001\n\nAn article yesterday about President Bush's manner during his news conference on Thursday night misstated the surname of the CNN commentator who drew a Shakespearean analogy to the president's growth. The speaker was Jeff Greenfield, not Greenberg. Speaking of one reporter needlessly nitpicking the work of another--Phil Rosenthal took a nasty shot or two at New York Times TV critic Alessandra Stanley yesterday. Writing about the distressingly correct position of Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly and Geraldo Rivera that Stanley maligned Rivera by writing that he \"nudged an Air Force rescue worker out of the way so his camera crew could tape him as he helped lift an older woman in a wheelchair to safety\" in New Orleans--the tape clearly shows that Rivera did no such thing and was in fact just helping carry a woman in a wheelchair--Rosenthal took a trip down memory lane to revisit some of Stanley's other errors, which clearly burn inside his eyelids when he goes to sleep each night.I immediately assumed that Rosenthal merely had it in for Stanley, a star of sorts on the TV beat who inspired envy among some critics (until a couple months ago, Rosenthal was the Sun-Times' TV critic). So I Nexised \"(byline)Alessandra Stanley and correction appended\" and--my. The woman is clocking corrections at more than a monthly rate. And they are stupid, stupid errors. Still, somehow I don't get the sense that anybody's writing any \"we have to stop Alessandra Stanley from writing for the Times--now\" memos.So herewith, for your reading pleasure: The Collected Corrections of Alessandra Stanley, with Grateful Acknowledgement to Phil Rosenthal for Getting the Ball Rolling. (In the interest of brevity, I only went back to 2001, when Stanley started writing incorrect things about television, and I made them really tiny. In Stanley's defense, her overall correction rate for that period is a not-quite-appalling-but-still-kinda-large 11 percent--she's got an 89 percent chance of being right! Her rate for the past year is a disconcerting 14 percent, or a one-in-seven chance of being wrong.) Now here's what I'd call a conflict of interest: On Saturday, August 27, ImprovOlympic (now called simply I.O., owing to a strongly-worded letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee's lawyers), held a 25th anniversary show in Chicago starring Mike Myers, Andy Richter, Amy Poehler, and other improv leading lights. How'd it go? Depends who you ask. Here's Chris Jones in the Chicago Tribune:\n\n At Saturday night's disastrous 25th anniversary show for ImprovOlympic, the free-wheeling, uber-casual, intensely creative atmosphere of Chicago improv ran slap up against the perfectly reasonable expectations of people attending a big 3,500-seat downtown venue, ponying up as much as $75 a ticket, and expecting that someone, somewhere might have thought for a moment or two about their needs. The problem, Jones wrote, was \"a jaw-dropping lack of technical planning and a sound failure of catastrophic proportions.\"\n\n\n\nThe Chicago Daily Herald agreed:\n\n [A] collective cringe gripped the audience as I.O. Theater alumni struggled with faulty body mics during the star- studded 25th anniversary salute to the scrappy Chicago improv theater founded by Charna Halpern and indelibly imprinted by the late master, Del Close.\n\n\n\nSans sound, the evening sputtered and stalled. But New York Times freelancer David Bernstein had a sunnier take on the proceedings:\n\n It seemed like a bad joke.\n\n\n\nThe 3,500-seat Chicago Theater was packed for the 25th anniversary reunion show of ImprovOlympic last Saturday, an event that had brought together an all-star array of comedians including Mike Myers, Andy Dick, Andy Richter, Mo Collins and Tim Meadows.\n\n\n\nAnd then the microphones went dead.\n\n\n\nFortunately, Mr. Myers, who spent eight months in the late 1980's at ImprovOlympic, the theater school and performance space here, and the other alumni on hand applied what they had learned at their beloved alma mater: they improvised.\n\n\n\nThe show was delayed about an hour, and the performers -- who included the ''Saturday Night Live'' repertory players Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch and Horatio Sanz, and the Upright Citizens Brigade comedy troupe -- had to resort to handheld microphones. (With mixed success; not everyone could hear their routines easily.) Still, the show still got plenty of laughs. Granted, the Tribune and Daily Herald pieces were reviews, whereas Bernstein's was a story about I.O. pegged to the event, including plenty of backstage cigarette-sneaking with Rachel Dratch. But he did gloss over what other observers described as nearly fatal sound problems.\n\n\n\nAnd I guess Bernstein was too busy hanging backstage to notice, as Jones did, the throngs who demanded their money back: \"At intermission in the lobby, it was an ugly scene. 'You guys are starting to yell and scream now,' improvised the harassed Scott Shiller, a theater official in the firing line. 'I need you to step away from me.'\"\n\n\n\nSo what could explain the different takes? I don't know, but some guy named Jacob, who wrote about the New York Times story on the ImprovChicago \n\n Dave, the reporter, also took classes at I.O.C. and performed some before his current gig at NYT. Hats off to him for getting to do the piece. Hats off to NYT for sending someone who might know a thing or two about improv and what we do to cover the story. Tribune probably just thought we were friends of the mayor and we all know how much they love the mayor. Because I don't believe anything I read on the Internets and because I have a daunting deadline approaching and desperately require distraction from certain unpleasant and inevitable realities, I called Bernstein to confirm that he did, in fact, take classes at I.O. and performed there two years ago while he was in journalism school at Medill. \"I basically got kicked off the team,\" he said, when school took up too much of his time.\n\n\n\n\"I wasn't writing a review,\" Bernstein told me. \"I was writing a feature on the theater itself. It was in my lede that the show had problems. If I wrote that it was the worst show in the world, people would have said it was because I got cut.\"\n\n\n\nFair enough. Which is a pretty good reason why he shouldn't be writing about the ImprovOlympic. Now here's what I'd call a conflict of interest: On Saturday, August 27, ImprovOlympic (now called simply I.O., owing to a strongly-worded letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee's lawyers), held a 25th anniversary show in Chicago starring Mike Myers, Andy Richter, Amy Poehler, and other improv leading lights.

'I need you to step away from me.'\"So what could explain the different takes? I don't know, but some guy named Jacob, who wrote about the New York Times story on the ImprovChicago message boards (scroll down to find the post), has an idea:Because I don't believe anything I read on the Internets and because I have a daunting deadline approaching and desperately require distraction from certain unpleasant and inevitable realities, I called Bernstein to confirm that he did, in fact, take classes at I.O. and performed there two years ago while he was in journalism school at Medill. \"I basically got kicked off the team,\" he said, when school took up too much of his time.\"I wasn't writing a review,\" Bernstein told me. \"I was writing a feature on the theater itself.

Which is a pretty good reason why he shouldn't be writing about the ImprovOlympic. The good news: Mac McCaughan's Portastatic got a nice big \n\n\n\nThe bad news (which I mention only because I'm a fanatic): Writer Matt McGuire inexplicably and repeatedly started referring to Portastatic's new record, \" The good news: Mac McCaughan's Portastatic got a nice big write-up in the Chicago Tribune on Friday in advance of Friday night's show at the Empty Bottle--which, by the way, was loud and rocking and absolutely phenomenal, but then again you knew I'd say that.The bad news (which I mention only because I'm a fanatic): Writer Matt McGuire inexplicably and repeatedly started referring to Portastatic's new record, \" Bright Ideas ,\" as \"Bright Eyes\" about halfway through the piece. As Mac said to me before the show, if he'd called it \"Bright Eyes,\" it certainly would have sold better. \n\n\n\nHow do you like this for a \n\n story in Friday's Tempo section about Oprah Winfrey's visit to hurricane-stricken New Orleans contained comparisons of Winfrey to President Bush that were unfavorable to Bush. The Tribune failed to disclose that the writer was a contributor to the presidential campaign last year of Bush's opponent, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.). Tribune standards require disclosure of any such conflict of interest. That's from Saturday's Chicago Tribune, and the reporter in question is my former colleague Maureen Ryan. Evidence of her political leanings can be found \n\n\n\nAnyway, I guess it was all cleared up and Ryan was told to keep her money to herself from now on. But it looks like that disclosure will be appended to every story she writes from here on out that comes anywhere near politics.\n\n\n\nWhich is pretty stupid. I don't think reporters ought to be publicly aligning themselves with political parties (which is what a donation really amounts to, since the logs are publicly available). But it's not, as the correction says, a conflict of interest to do so. A conflict of interest is when someone has more than one interest, and two or more of those interests are in conflict with each other.\n\n\n\nTake, for example, a newspaper editor. Let's say this newspaper editor has a professional interest in seeing to it that his or her newspaper aggressively and fairly reports on the doings of an enormous media and entertainment \n\n\n\nIn Ryan's case, there is no conflict. Her political donations don't constitute an interest in the election of a Democrat to the office of president, they a pre-existing interest. You can't fault Ryan for holding partisan political views. The problem with her donations is that they announce those views to anyone who cares to look through a donor database, thereby giving ammunition to anyone who wants to attack the Tribune's credibility and inviting unwanted scrutiny of her work. And by publishing a well-intentioned clarification, the Tribune merely compounded the problem and made far more people aware of Ryan's political allegiances than were aware before. How do you like this for a correction That's from Saturday's Chicago Tribune, and the reporter in question is my former colleague Maureen Ryan. Evidence of her political leanings can be found here (a full search at fecinfo.com comes up with a total of $4,000 in political giving last year). I was at the Tribune when word of Ryan's donations--which clearly violated the Trib's ethics policy--started going around after, I'm told, a reporter happened across them during a database search (there was no question who it was, since she listed her employer and occupation on the FEC donor forms as \"tribune company/writer.\") There was some correct tsk-tsking of what was clearly a boneheaded move on Ryan's part, but the astonishing thing is that, as it turns out, she had gotten a sign-off from her superiors before she made the donations. Also astonishing is the fact that someone on a hack's salary has $4,000 lying around to give to the least compelling political candidate in modern history, but that's another story.Anyway, I guess it was all cleared up and Ryan was told to keep her money to herself from now on. But it looks like that disclosure will be appended to every story she writes from here on out that comes anywhere near politics.Which is pretty stupid. I don't think reporters ought to be publicly aligning themselves with political parties (which is what a donation really amounts to, since the logs are publicly available). But it's not, as the correction says, a conflict of interest to do so. A conflict of interest is when someone has more than one interest, and two or more of those interests are in conflict with each other.Take, for example, a newspaper editor. Let's say this newspaper editor has a professional interest in seeing to it that his or her newspaper aggressively and fairly reports on the doings of an enormous media and entertainment conglomerate that reaches tens of millions of people through its newspapers, television stations, and sports teams. And let's say this newspaper editor also has an interest in seeing his or her retirement account, which consists in large part of stock (and options to purchase stock at a reduced price) in the aforementioned media and entertainment conglomerate, continue to grow in value. And let's further say that this newspaper editor's future at the newspaper and the company that owns the newspaper depends in large part on decisions made by executives at the amentioned media and entertainment conglomerate. In such an instance, a conflict of interest would obtain each time our hypothetical newspaper editor made a decision about how to cover the aforementioned media and entertainment conglomerate: The editor's professional interest in fair and aggressive coverage could conflict with his or her personal interest in career advancement and a secure retirement. So that's a conflict of interest. I don't recall ever seeing any conflicts like that one disclosed in the pages of the Tribune.In Ryan's case, there is no conflict. Her political donations don't constitute an interest in the election of a Democrat to the office of president, theya pre-existing interest. You can't fault Ryan for holding partisan political views. The problem with her donations is that they announce those views to anyone who cares to look through a donor database, thereby giving ammunition to anyone who wants to attack the Tribune's credibility and inviting unwanted scrutiny of her work. And by publishing a well-intentioned clarification, the Tribune merely compounded the problem and made far more people aware of Ryan's political allegiances than were aware before. If you sent e-mail to the john@referencetone.com address between now and August 29, I didn't get it. And I don't think they got bounced back or anything, just lost.

They were reading the Washington Post. \n\n In its Tuesday, Aug. 30, edition, the paper produced a shallow Day 1 account of the storm, reaching the conclusion that New Orleans had averted disaster: ‚ÄúBut the city managed to avoid the worst of the worst. The Mississippi River did not breach New Orleans‚Äôs famed levees to any serious degree, at least in part because Katrina veered 15 miles eastward of its predicted track just before landfall,‚Äù read the lead story.\n\n\n\nAnd to judge from the Post, there was no crisis brewing on the evacuation front, either. ‚ÄúThose who remained behind were mostly visitors and tourists trapped because the airport had closed,‚Äù according to the same story. By contrast, \n\n New Orleans, most of the levees held, but one was damaged. Floodwaters rose to rooftops in one neighborhood, and in many areas emergency workers pulled residents from roofs. The hurricane's howling winds stripped 15-foot sections off the roof of the Superdome, where as many as 10,000 evacuees took shelter....\n\n\n\n\"I can't say that we've escaped the worst,\" Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said. \"I think there is still damage that can be inflicted on the city. We don't even know what the worst is.\" The other day, our friends over at Wonkette wasted a little time trying to figure out exactly which newspapers Chertoff and Brown were reading last week that gave them an indication that \"New Orleans dodged a bullet\" the morning after Katrina made landfall. Wonkette surmised that the headlines were in a White House internal newsletter of some sort--another headline from that morning's edition: \"Baghdad Citizens Endorse Constitution and Personal Retirement Accounts.\"It turns out the truth is much simpler. They were reading the Washington Post. Here 's the City Paper's Erik Wemple and Jason Cherkis (via Romenesko ):By contrast, here 's what the New York Times had that morning: \n\n\n\nGeorge Bush care about black people! How else to explain :\n\n Disaster prep is \n\nAnd mitigation is important to our agency \n\n\n\nAlso \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nUPDATE: I guess Crooks & Liars George Bushcare about black people! How else to explain this \"FEMA For Kidz\" rap on the agency's web site? And do we need to spell it out any more clearly that Bush, Chertoff, and Brown can't fairly be held responsible for the failure of local and state authorities to prepare for Katrina? I mean, come on--I mean, jeez, if these people won't listen when you speak to them in their own language, then what's a government supposed to do?Also found on the FEMA For Kidz page: We still don't know for sure what newspaper Chertoff was reading that told him New Orleans dodged a bullet, but we think little Katie Sullivan is the editorial cartoonist.UPDATE: I guess Crooks & Liars noted this over the weekend. The Soft Bigotry of No Preparations George Bush, master of \n\n Meeting with Red Cross officials in Washington Sunday, President Bush on Sunday thanked the agency's nearly 5,000 volunteers working at shelters in 19 states helping displaced Louisiana residents, and promised victims a \"tidal wave of compassion.\" George Bush, master of wordcraft Bush continued: \"America is sending roving armed gangs of love to help the good people of New Orleans and loot them of their misery. We will shower them with the dysentery of human kindness, and spread the feces of safety around the floor where they sleep.\" I Literally Can't Get Away From These People I've been watching the \n\n\n\nBut Evan Cohen I've been watching the outrage over Air America and the Gloria Wise Boys & Girls Club loan from afar, and without picking up the telephone, because I spent too many hours trying to get to the bottom of that mess when I was covering it for the Tribune. There was a time when I would have been slobbering over stuff like this, but I just couldn't bring myself to care anymore.But Evan Cohen called the other day.",

In all, more than 1,700 people were killed and hundreds of thousands of others displaced.\n\nPacking 145-mile-an-hour winds as it made landfall, the category 3 storm left more than a million people in three states without power and submerged highways even hundreds of miles from its center. The hurricane‚Äôs storm surge ‚Äî a 29-foot wall of water pushed ashore when the hurricane struck the Gulf Coast ‚Äî was the highest ever measured in the United States. Levees failed in New Orleans, resulting in political and social upheavals that continued a half decade later.\n\nKatrina ranks as one of the most punishing hurricanes ever to hit the United States. Damage, costing billions of dollars, has made it one of the costliest storms on record. In New Orleans, floodwaters from the breached levee rose to rooftops in the poorest neighborhood, and in many areas residents were rescued from roofs of homes that became uninhabitable. The hurricane‚Äôs howling winds stripped 15-foot sections off the roof of the Superdome, where as many as 10,000 evacuees had taken shelter.

And experts say that understanding the failings is essential in planning the next generation of flood protection for a rebuilt New Orleans, and for systems nationwide.\n\nThe head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Michael D. Brown, was stripped of his post amid fears within the Bush administration that its delayed response to the disaster could do lasting damage to both President George W. Bush‚Äôs power and his legacy. But more important to some members of the administration, it dented the administration‚Äôs aura of competence. In the end, the federal government‚Äôs response was seen as too little and too late. In the wake of the storm, the region‚Äôs grinding poverty, longstanding corruption and political ineptitude ‚Äî particularly in the Big Easy ‚Äî were exposed along with the inadequacies of federal, state and local agencies. Gradually,¬†the region stabilized as aid was meted out and many of its residents returned. Rulings on the Army Corps of Engineers In November 2009, Judge Stanwood Duval Jr. of federal District Court ruled that poor maintenance of a major navigation channel,¬†the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet or MR-GO, by the Army Corps of Engineers led to some of the worst flooding after the hurricane. It was the first time that the government was held liable for any of the flooding that inundated the New Orleans area after Aug. 29, 2005, vindicating the long-held contention of many in the region that the flooding was far more than an act of God. While the government is generally immune from flooding claims resulting from failures of flood control projects, Judge Duval ruled that damage related to the 76-mile channel was different because its purpose was navigation, not flood protection, even though it was lined with levees. The government appealed the decision, asking the full circuit to rehear the case. In September 2012, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that the government is immune from lawsuits for decisions made by the corps that might have left the¬† MR-GO vulnerable. ‚ÄúMR-GO‚Äôs size and configuration greatly aggravated the storm‚Äôs effects on the city and its environs,‚Äù wrote Judge Jerry E. Smith, writing for a three-judge panel, adding that the federal tort claims act ‚Äúcompletely insulates the government from liability.‚Äù In March, the same panel had ruled that the government was liable for some of the flooding, affirming the 2009 ruling by Judge Duval. Seven years to the week after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans was hit by another potentially deadly storm. Isaac was a Category 1 hurricane that caused severe flooding through a wide area of Louisiana and Mississippi. In New Orleans, though, the the $14.5 billion in levee defenses put in place since 2005 passed its first test. But a Category 1 storm with surges of 10 to 14 feet presented challenges less severe than the new ring of defenses were designed to meet. Nearly Seven Years Later, Police Shooters Sentenced On April 4, 2012, five former police officers were sentenced to lengthy prison terms in federal court in New Orleans for the shootings of six unarmed civilians, two of whom died, in the days after Hurricane Katrina, and for orchestrating a wide-ranging cover-up afterward. The five former police officers were convicted in August 2011 on a range of counts including federal civil rights violations and lying to investigators. On Sept. 4, 2005, as much of New Orleans still lay submerged in floodwaters, Kenneth Bowen and Robert Gisevius, then sergeants, and Anthony Villavaso and Robert Faulcon, then officers, jumped in a Budget rental truck and raced with other officers to the Danziger Bridge in eastern New Orleans, responding to a distress call on the police radio. As soon as they arrived, witnesses at the trial said, they began firing on members of the Bartholomew family, who were trying to find a grocery store. A 17-year-old family friend named James Brisette was killed, and four others were severely wounded. The police then began to chase two brothers, Lance and Ronald Madison, who was 40 years old and mentally disabled, who were trying to get to the other side of the bridge. Ronald Madison was shot in the back by Officer Faulcon and then stomped on by Sergeant Bowen as he lay dying. A cover-up began immediately and eventually grew to include made-up witnesses and a planted handgun. Sgt. Arthur Kaufman, a veteran investigator, was charged with overseeing much of the cover-up. He was sentenced to six years. The four who were involved in the actual shooting were sentenced to terms ranging from 38 to 65 years.",

working emergency rooms beachfront homes wrecked and major stretches of the coastal highway flooded and unpassable it came on mississippi like a ton of bricks gov haley barbour said at a midday news conference its a terrible storm president bush promised extensive assistance for hurricane victims and the federal emergency management agency was expected to be working in the area for months assessing damage to properties and allocating what is likely to be billions of dollars in aid to homeowners and businesses in alabama louisiana and mississippi the governors declared search and rescue their top priority but they said high waters and strong winds were keeping them from that task particularly in the hardesthit areas the governors sent out the police and the national guard after reports of looting and officials in some parts of louisiana said they would impose a curfew hurricane katrina was downgraded from category 5 the most dangerous storm to category 4 as it hit land in eastern louisiana just after 6 am and in new orleans officials said the storms slight shift to the east had spared them somewhat the city is below sea level and there had been predictions that the historic french quarter would be under 18 or 20 feet of water still no one was finding much comfort here with 100 mph winds and water surges of up to 15 feet officials said early in the day that more than 20 buildings had been toppled i cant say that weve escaped the worst gov kathleen babineaux blanco said i think there is still damage that can be inflicted on the city we dont even know what the worst is preliminary damage estimates from the hurricane which raked across southern florida last week as a category 1 storm before reaching the warm waters of the gulf of mexico and making its run at the gulf coast ranged from 9 billion to 16 billion only hurricane andrew which ripped through parts of florida louisiana and mississippi in august 1992 was costlier with nearly 21 billion in insured losses beyond the property damage caused by flooding and the high winds hurricane katrina also dealt a blow to the oil industry and the lucrative casinos that have been the economic engine for the region both oil production on offshore platforms and gambling in the string of casinos that dot the mississippi gulf coast shut down on sunday as the storm approached since friday oil output in the gulf of mexico has been cut by 31 million barrels closing the casinos cost mississippi 400000 to 500000 a day in lost tax revenue alone and mr barbour said officials had not yet been able to determine the extent of damage to the casinos the storm pounded new orleans for eight hours straight flooding overwhelmed levees built to protect the city from the mississippi river and lake pontchartrain sending muddy water swirling into the narrow streets downtown on the southern shore of the lake entire neighborhoods of onestory homes were flooded to the rooflines with nearby offramps for interstate

the storm without major damage and a third shut down on saturday in anticipation of the hurricane according to entergy nuclear which owns all three the extent of damage to the plant that shut down waterford 20 miles west of new orleans was still unknown late monday afternoon because the wind was blowing too hard to go out and look said diane park a spokeswoman the more sparsely populated

and floodwaters in st bernard the emergency center was submerged and officials estimated that 40000 homes too were flooded parish officials reported in early afternoon that many residents had been driven to their roofs officials estimated 80 percent of new orleans residents had obeyed the order to evacuate but in areas that had been expecting less damage officials were worried and annoyed that large numbers of people tried to ride out the storm in plaquemines and terrebonne parishes south and west of the city officials said they were particularly concerned about commercial fisherman who had decided to remain on their boats my biggest concern is the loss of life said state senator walter j boasso we have a lot of people down there hiding in their attics and i dont know if we will get to them fast enough in mississippi mr barbour said many people suffered from what he called hurricane fatigue deciding not to evacuate this time after having done so in the past only to be spared we pray

flexing the roof like a deck of cards they had decided against evacuating mr haller said judging the storm just a lot of rain we rode the house mr haller said emerging from the waters here his son carrying their dachshund kuddles mr barbour said casinos along the coast near biloxi and gulfport had been hit by surges of more than 20 feet but casino workers could not reach them to survey the damage he said because us 90 had essentially been destroyed along the coast in mobile ala 150 miles east of new orleans thousands of evacuees from mississippi and louisiana were filling shelters and the hotels that had remained open the lowestlying areas of mobile and baldwin counties in alabama were evacuated on sunday night by noon areas south of interstate 10 were already flooding and the storm surge was pushing the water toward the city of mobile and mobile bay as the hurricane progressed downtown mobile which is right on the bay was severely flooded by monday afternoon the water pushing down the main streets around the county courthouse and lapping at the sandbagged doors and windows at the mobile museum water all but covered a number of street signs and parking meters and large heavy planters and some newspaper boxes floated down the streets the main hotels in the city were just a block or two from the worst flooding causing concerns that they too would be flooded at least in the main floors and as power and phone lines went down evacuees were getting restless paul weir said he had not left his home in meraux la just outside new orleans during a storm since hurricane betsy in 1965 and left on sunday morning only after hearing that hurricane katrina was a category 5 he drove with his wife daughter and four friends to mobile with roads clogged with other residents fleeing what is normally a threehour drive took 12 by monday afternoon the family was obsessing about what they would find when they got home if i was home i wouldve went on a roof for two days just like everybody else said susan weir mr weirs wife said id rather be in that situation than here honestly this is expensive and ive only got a credit card with a 2000 limit at the ramada hotel in downtown mobile edith frieson sat anxiously in a soggy room wondering why her husband had not returned he left maybe three hours ago to go down and see if he could check the house said mrs frieson who lives on dauphin island a narrow barrier island south of mobile the island was already flooding on sunday afternoon like most storms hurricane katrina weakened as it came onshore and by monday evening the national hurricane center had downgraded it to a tropical storm the center of the storm had moved its heavy rains toward jackson miss but state officials said the hurricane had been an unusually large one causing a wide swath of damage and they expected to be dealing with damage for days if not weeks in louisiana ms blanco pleaded with residents who had evacuated not to rush back the roads are flooded the power is out the phones are down and there is no food or water and many trees are down she said wherever you live it is still too dangerous for people to return home she continued if you evacuated and youre in a shelter if youre with friends and family please please stay there stay safe michael d brown the director of the federal emergency management agency reminded people that most injuries from hurricanes occurred after the storm had passed be careful mr brown said standing next to the governor at a news conference dont get in that water watch for downed power lines if youre going to use a chainsaw know how to use a chainsaw if youre going to have a generator know how to exercise and operate the generator be very very careful the storm is not over mr brown also discouraged fire and emergency agencies outside the storm area from sending in crews unless they had been asked even before the hurricane hit the new orleans area fema had positioned 23 of its disaster medical assistance teams and 7 search and rescue teams around the region it also delivered generators and stockpiles of water ice and readytoeat meals it even sent in two teams of veterinarians to provide care to any injured pets or other animals as of early monday about 52000 people were in 240 shelters in alabama mississippi louisiana florida and texas with the majority in

Emergency workers feared that they would find more dead among people who had been trapped in their homes and in collapsed buildings.\n\nJim Pollard, a spokesman for the Harrison County emergency operations center, said many of the dead were found in an apartment complex in Biloxi. Seven others were found in the Industrial Seaway.\n\nPacking 145-mile-an-hour winds as it made landfall, the storm left more than a million people in three states without power and submerged highways even hundreds of miles from its center.\n\nThe storm was potent enough to rank as one of the most punishing hurricanes ever to hit the United States. Insurance experts said that damage could exceed $9 billion, which would make it one of the costliest storms on record.\n\nIn New Orleans, most of the levees held, but one was damaged. Floodwaters rose to rooftops in one neighborhood, and in many areas emergency workers pulled residents from roofs. The hurricane's howling winds stripped 15-foot sections off the roof of the Superdome, where as many as 10,000 evacuees took shelter.\n\nSome of the worst damage reports came from east of New Orleans with an estimated 40,000 homes reported flooded in St. Bernard Parish. In Gulfport, the storm left three of five hospitals without working emergency rooms, beachfront homes wrecked and major stretches of the coastal highway flooded and unpassable.\n\n\"It came on Mississippi like a ton of bricks,\" Gov. Haley Barbour said at a midday news conference \"It's a terrible storm.\"\n\nPresident Bush promised extensive assistance for hurricane victims, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency was expected to be working in the area for months, assessing damage to properties and allocating what is likely to be billions of dollars in aid to homeowners and businesses.\n\nIn Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, the governors declared search and rescue their top priority, but they said high waters and strong winds were keeping them from that task, particularly in the hardest-hit areas.\n\nThe governors sent out the police and the National Guard after reports of looting, and officials in some parts of Louisiana said they would impose a curfew.\n\nHurricane Katrina was downgraded from Category 5 - the most dangerous storm - to Category 4 as it hit land in eastern Louisiana just after 6 a.m., and in New Orleans officials said the storm's slight shift to the east had spared them somewhat. The city is below sea level, and there had been predictions that the historic French Quarter would be under 18 or 20 feet of water.\n\nStill, no one was finding much comfort here, with 100 m.p.h. winds and water surges of up to 15 feet. Officials said early in the day that more than 20 buildings had been toppled.\n\n\"I can't say that we've escaped the worst,\" Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco said. \"I think there is still damage that can be inflicted on the city. We don't even know what the worst is.\"\n\nPreliminary damage estimates from the hurricane - which raked across southern Florida last week as a Category 1 storm before reaching the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and making its run at the Gulf Coast - ranged from $9 billion to $16 billion. Only Hurricane Andrew, which ripped through parts of Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi in August 1992, was costlier - with nearly $21 billion in insured losses.\n\nBeyond the property damage caused by flooding and the high winds, Hurricane Katrina also dealt a blow to the oil industry and the lucrative casinos that have been the economic engine for the region. Both oil production on offshore platforms and gambling in the string of casinos that dot the Mississippi Gulf Coast shut down on Sunday as the storm approached.\n\nSince Friday, oil output in the Gulf of Mexico has been cut by 3.1 million barrels. Closing the casinos cost Mississippi $400,000 to $500,000 a day in lost tax revenue alone, and Mr. Barbour said officials had not yet been able to determine the extent of damage to the casinos.\n\nThe storm pounded New Orleans for eight hours straight. Flooding overwhelmed levees built to protect the city from the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, sending muddy water swirling into the narrow streets downtown. On the southern shore of the lake, entire neighborhoods of one-story homes were flooded to the rooflines, with nearby off-ramps for Interstate 10 looking like boat ramps amid the waves.\n\nAlong the lake were snapped telephone poles, trees blocking roads and live wires scattered over the roads. In one cabin, a family was cooking a chicken dinner over charcoal briquettes on a hibachi. They had lost power like everyone else in the area.\n\nWindows were blown off condominiums, hotels, office buildings and Charity Hospital, sending chards of glass into the winds. Fires broke out despite torrential rain, some ignited, the authorities said, by residents who lighted candles after the electricity went out.\n\nThe storm knocked out telephone and cellular service across swaths of the gulf region, and officials in New Orleans said parts of the city could remain without power for weeks.\n\nTwo nuclear plants near the path of Hurricane Katrina appear to have weathered the storm without major damage, and a third shut down on Saturday, in anticipation of the hurricane, according to Entergy Nuclear, which owns all three. The extent of damage to the plant that shut down, Waterford, 20 miles west of New Orleans, was still unknown late Monday afternoon because the wind was blowing too hard to go out and look, said Diane Park, a spokeswoman.\n\nThe more sparsely populated parishes east of New Orleans, meanwhile, got hit much harder than anyone had expected.\n\nMs. Blanco said Plaquemines, Orleans, St. Bernard, Jefferson and St. Tammany Parishes had been \"devastated by high winds and floodwaters.\" In St. Bernard, the emergency center was submerged, and officials estimated that 40,000 homes, too, were flooded.\n\nParish officials reported in early afternoon that many residents had been driven to their roofs.\n\nOfficials estimated 80 percent of New Orleans residents had obeyed the order to evacuate. But in areas that had been expecting less damage, officials were worried - and annoyed - that large numbers of people tried to ride out the storm.\n\nIn Plaquemines and Terrebonne Parishes, south and west of the city, officials said they were particularly concerned about commercial fisherman who had decided to remain on their boats.\n\n\"My biggest concern is the loss of life,\" said State Senator Walter J. Boasso. \"We have a lot of people down there hiding in their attics, and I don't know if we will get to them fast enough.\"\n\nIn Mississippi, Mr. Barbour said many people suffered from what he called \"hurricane fatigue,\" deciding not to evacuate this time after having done so in the past only to be spared.\n\n\"We pray that those people are O.K.,\" he said. \"But we don't know.\"\n\nIn Diamondhead, Miss., Don Haller and his 17-year-old son, Don Jr., were left clinging to the remains of their house when a 23-foot surge of water hit it, flexing the roof like a deck of cards.\n\nThey had decided against evacuating, Mr. Haller said, judging the storm \"just a lot of rain.\"\n\n\"We rode the house,\" Mr. Haller said, emerging from the waters here, his son carrying their dachshund, Kuddles.\n\nMr. Barbour said casinos along the coast near Biloxi and Gulfport had been hit by surges of more than 20 feet. But casino workers could not reach them to survey the damage, he said, because U.S. 90 had \"essentially been destroyed.\"\n\nAlong the coast in Mobile, Ala., 150 miles east of New Orleans, thousands of evacuees from Mississippi and Louisiana were filling shelters and the hotels that had remained open.\n\nThe lowest-lying areas of Mobile and Baldwin Counties in Alabama were evacuated on Sunday night. By noon, areas south of Interstate 10 were already flooding, and the storm surge was pushing the water toward the city of Mobile and Mobile Bay as the hurricane progressed.\n\nDowntown Mobile, which is right on the bay, was severely flooded by Monday afternoon, the water pushing down the main streets around the county courthouse and lapping at the sandbagged doors and windows at the Mobile Museum. Water all but covered a number of street signs and parking meters, and large, heavy planters and some newspaper boxes floated down the streets.\n\nThe main hotels in the city were just a block or two from the worst flooding, causing concerns that they, too, would be flooded, at least in the main floors. And as power and phone lines went down, evacuees were getting restless.\n\nPaul Weir said he had not left his home in Meraux, La., just outside New Orleans, during a storm since Hurricane Betsy in 1965, and left on Sunday morning only after hearing that Hurricane Katrina was a Category 5. He drove with his wife, daughter and four friends to Mobile; with roads clogged with other residents fleeing, what is normally a three-hour drive took 12.\n\nBy Monday afternoon the family was obsessing about what they would find when they got home.\n\n\"If I was home, I would've went on a roof for two days just like everybody else,\" said Susan Weir, Mr. Weir's wife, said. \"I'd rather be in that situation than here, honestly. This is expensive and I've only got a credit card with a $2,000 limit.\"\n\nAt the Ramada Hotel in downtown Mobile, Edith Frieson sat anxiously in a soggy room wondering why her husband had not returned. \"He left maybe three hours ago to go down and see if he could check the house,\" said Mrs. Frieson, who lives on Dauphin Island, a narrow barrier island south of Mobile. The island was already flooding on Sunday afternoon.\n\nLike most storms, Hurricane Katrina weakened as it came onshore, and by Monday evening the National Hurricane Center had downgraded it to a tropical storm. The center of the storm had moved its heavy rains toward Jackson, Miss.\n\nBut state officials said the hurricane had been an unusually large one, causing a wide swath of damage, and they expected to be dealing with damage for days if not weeks.\n\nIn Louisiana, Ms. Blanco pleaded with residents who had evacuated not to rush back.\n\n\"The roads are flooded, the power is out, the phones are down and there is no food or water, and many trees are down,\" she said.\n\n\"Wherever you live, it is still too dangerous for people to return home,\" she continued. \"If you evacuated and you're in a shelter, if you're with friends and family, please, please stay there. Stay safe.\"\n\nMichael D. Brown, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, reminded people that most injuries from hurricanes occurred after the storm had passed.\n\n\"Be careful,\" Mr. Brown said, standing next to the governor at a news conference. \"Don't get in that water. Watch for downed power lines. If you're going to use a chainsaw, know how to use a chainsaw. If you're going to have a generator, know how to exercise and operate the generator. Be very, very careful. The storm is not over.\"\n\nMr. Brown also discouraged fire and emergency agencies outside the storm area from sending in crews unless they had been asked.\n\nEven before the hurricane hit the New Orleans area, FEMA had positioned 23 of its disaster medical assistance teams and 7 search and rescue teams around the region. It also delivered generators, and stockpiles of water, ice and ready-to-eat meals. It even sent in two teams of veterinarians to provide care to any injured pets or other animals.\n\nAs of early Monday, about 52,000 people were in 240 shelters in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida and Texas, with the majority in the Superdome in New Orleans.",

overturned on interstate 49 near opelousas the police said killing one person and injuring 17 others admissions to the astrodome were halted after about 11000 people had been accepted fewer than half of what was planned because officials felt it had become crowded enough the superdome where upward of 25000 people had sweltered in conditions described as unfit for animals was mostly emptied though 1500 were still there late friday they had renamed the place rife with overflowing toilets and reports of murder and rape the sewerdome edgar john thead 68 who sat with his 65yearold wife said he had been in line for the buses at 4 am but had to withdraw because his diabetic wife could not stand the heat ill be the last one in line he said throughout new orleans thousands of people many of them among the citys poorest and most marginalized residents were still unsure when and how they would get out an estimated 20000 were said to be at the fourstory convention center which at some points apparently attracted as many refugees as the superdome but was ignored much longer by rescue operations conditions there were even worse than at the superdome with armed thugs seizing control and the authorities said repulsing squads of police officers sent to retake it on friday morning people huddled in small groups inside the center or sat on orange folding chairs outside a gruesome mockery of an actual convention amid overflowing toilets an elderly women and a teenage boy were having seizures in the arms of relatives evacuees said that seven dead bodies littered the third floor they said a 14yearold girl had been raped there was a pervasive feeling of abandonment the trucks kept passing us up they just kept going further east said louis martin sr a truck driver who had been at the

soft applause while others jeered a woman ran alongside the van shrieking we dont need food get us out of here throughout the city where it was dry enough people wandered in dazes along st charles avenue clumps of people trudged with plastic bags of belongings some had fled the violence of the convention center others searched for vans outside the hyatt hotel next to the superdome scores of

with her two small children since monday she said she saw a rape and heard that a girls throat had been cut the quickest way out of the city on friday seemed to be the airport after government officials arranged for more than a dozen airlines and cargo operators to volunteer planes to fly people to safety but the lines never seemed to diminish as soon as one flight took off seven or eight helicopters would land on the tarmac with additional batches of survivors airport authorities did not know where the helicopters came from helicopters just appear said carolyn lowe a deputy director of the airport other cities and states continued to extend interim refuge and other forms of aid for the affected areas philadelphia announced that it was willing to take in a thousand families from new orleans and detroit offered refuge as well new york florida ohio oklahoma georgia california utah virginia and washington were among other states offering to provide general support or take refugees some states promised to allow children of evacuees to enroll in their schools during his tour of the area president bush kissed two weeping women who said they had lost everything in biloxi and he then walked down the street with his arms around them speaking about the rescue and relief efforts before leaving washington mr bush acknowledged that the results are not acceptable and pledged to do more saying the 105 billion in aid authorized by congress was but a down payment on the disaster relief in washington members of the congressional black caucus called the federal response shameful and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle promised hearings on what had gone wrong that there was much peril remaining in new orleans was without question before daybreak an explosion tore through a warehouse along the mississippi river a dozen blocks or so from the french quarter and a fire at an oil storage facility across the river sent a plume of smoke across the city the situation was terrifying at some of the citys hospitals for much of the day doctors nurses and patients at charity hospital had to plead for help for more than 100 patients who were later evacuated after violence had earlier prevented rescuers from getting in six patients had died during the wait for evacuation staff members were still inside and some were reportedly keeping others alive with intravenous fluids all were evacuated by the end of the day those who call new orleans home and cherish its idiosyncratic stamp on the american landscape could only guess at what their city would look like and how broken it would be when the day came that the waters went away the army corps of engineers kept at the repair work on the broken levees that had allowed lake pontchartrain to thunder into the bowllike city after it seemed that damage from the hurricane had ceased and after three days of delays the corps and a swelling army of private contractors slowly began to set the stage for draining the hundreds of billions of gallons of floodwaters from the city the plan was to close the holes that the storm tides had opened and break open new holes in places where the levees were

the 300foot breach in a wall of the 17th street canal through which most of the floodwaters passed at the same time heavylift helicopters lowered hundreds of huge sandbags into the south end of the

storm front move in on us general strock said efforts to set life right again persisted throughout the gulf coast as hundreds of thousands went on without electricity and in many cases homes relatives still sought feverishly to find loved ones the number of deaths remained unknown with estimates continuing to run into the thousands researchers who flew over 180 miles of coast between pensacola fla and grand isle la said that along the shore for blocks inland nothing remained but concrete slabs and chunks of asphalt often they said it was impossible to tell what had been there before the storm

western side of the state fared well everything east of bayou lafourche to the mississippi line was ruined the area accounts for twothirds of the states oyster harvesting or 181 million a year with

Seven bodies were found in the Industrial Seaway, a canal that runs from the Gulf of Mexico to the Back Bay in Gulfport.\n\nAt least three people were killed by falling trees in Mississippi, and two were killed in a traffic accident in Alabama.\n\nEmergency workers feared that they would find more dead among people trapped in their homes and in collapsed buildings.\n\n\"Some of them, it was their last night on Earth,\" Terry Ebbert, chief of homeland security for New Orleans, said of people who ignored orders to evacuate the city of 480,000 over the weekend. \"That's a hard way to learn a lesson.\"\n\nWhile Katrina proved to be less fearsome than had been predicted, it was still potent enough to rank as one of the most punishing hurricanes ever to hit the United States. Insurance experts said that damage could exceed $9 billion, which would make it one of the costliest storms on record.\n\nIn New Orleans, most of the levees held, but one was damaged, and floodwaters rose to rooftops in one neighborhood. Katrina's howling winds stripped 15-foot sections off the roof of the Superdome, where as many as 10, 000 evacuees were sheltered.\n\nSome of the worst damage reports came from east of New Orleans, where an estimated 40,000 homes were reported flooded in St. Bernard Parish. In Gulfport, Miss., the storm left several hospitals without working emergency rooms, beachfront homes wrecked and major stretches of Mississippi's coastal highway flooded and impassable.\n\n\"It came on Mississippi like a ton of bricks,\" said the state's governor, Haley Barbour. \"It's a terrible storm.\"\n\nPresident Bush promised extensive assistance for hurricane victims, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency was expected to be working in the area for months, assessing damage to properties and allocating aid.\n\nIn Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, the governors declared search and rescue their top priority but said that high waters and strong winds were keeping them from that task, particularly in the hardest hit areas.\n\nThe governors sent out police and National Guard troops after reports of looting.\n\nThe federal government began rushing baby formula, communications equipment, generators, water and ice into hard-hit areas, along with doctors, nurses and first aid supplies.

Kathleen Babineaux Blanco. \"I think there is still damage that can be inflicted on the city.\"\n\nPreliminary damage estimates from Katrina ranged from $9 billion to $16 billion. Only Hurricane Andrew, which ripped through parts of Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi in August 1992, was costlier, resulting in nearly $21 billion in insured losses.\n\nThe storm pounded New Orleans for eight hours straight. Flooding overwhelmed the levees built to protect the city from the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain, sending muddy water swirling into the narrow and meandering streets downtown. Wide stretches of lowlands beyond the city were transformed into lakes.\n\nWindows blew off condominiums, hotels, office buildings and Charity Hospital, sending shards of glass into the winds. Fires broke out, some sparked by residents who lit candles after the power went out.\n\nThe storm knocked out phone service and cell phone service across swaths of the region.\n\nThe more sparsely populated parishes east of here, meanwhile, got hit much harder than anyone had expected.\n\nBlanco said that Plaquemines, Orleans, St. Bernard, Jefferson and St. Tammany parishes were \"devastated by high winds and floodwaters.\" In St. Bernard, the emergency center was submerged, and officials estimated that 40, 000 homes were flooded.\n\n\"I've never encountered anything like it in my life. It just kept rising and rising and rising,\" said Bryan Vernon, who spent three hours on his roof, screaming over howling winds for someone to save him and his fiancee.\n\nAlong the coast in Mobile, Ala., 150 miles east of New Orleans, thousands of evacuees from Mississippi and Louisiana were filling shelters and the hotels that had remained open.\n\nThe lowest-lying areas of Mobile and Baldwin counties in Alabama had been evacuated Sunday night. By noon, areas south of Interstate 10 were already flooding, and the storm surge was pushing the water toward the city of Mobile.\n\nDowntown Mobile was severely flooded by Monday afternoon, the water pushing down the main streets of town around the county courthouse. Water all but covered many street signs and parking meters; large planters and newspaper boxes floated down the streets.\n\nPaul Weir said he had not left his home in Meraux, La., just outside New Orleans, during a storm since Hurricane Betsy in 1965, and left Sunday morning only after hearing that Katrina was a Category 5. He drove with his family and friends to Mobile; with roads clogged, what was normally a three-hour drive took 12. By Monday afternoon the family was obsessing about what they would find at home.\n\n\"If I was home, I would've went on a roof for two days just like everybody else,\" said Weir's wife, Susan. \"I'd rather be in that situation than here, honestly. This is expensive, and I've only got a credit card with a $2,000 limit.\"\n\nThe storm hammered Alabama's coast with huge waves and tree-bending winds. Water swirled in the streets of Gulf Shores, where an all-day curfew was declared.\n\nTwo people died in a wreck attributed to heavy rains.\n\nStately homes in a well-to-do section of Mobile Bay were awash in brown baywater storming over docks and porches.\n\nAt least 400,000 homes and businesses lost power.\n\nIn New Orleans, up to 20 feet of water was standing in one poor neighborhood on the city's east side. Winds up to 100 mph shattered scores of windows on high-rise office buildings and ripped holes in the roof of the Superdome, where up to thousands of refugees had sought shelter. A 50-foot water main broke, making it unsafe to drink the city's water without first boiling it.\n\nIn coastal St. Bernard Parish, an estimated 40,000 homes were flooded. \"Some 370,000 customers in southeast Louisiana are without power.\n\nA 22-foot storm surge was recorded in Bay St. Louis. Gulfport Memorial Hospital in Biloxi experienced major damage.\n\nAt least 50 people were killed in Harrison County. Three other people were killed in the state by falling trees.\n\nThe Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said about 8,500 people are in 79 shelters. American Red Cross shelters are filled to capacity.\n\nSeveral of Mississippi's beachfront casinos were flooded.\n\nMore than 200,000 customers of one utility lost power, but total outages in the state were unclear.\n\nKatrina hit the southern tip of Florida on Thursday as a Category 1 hurricane, killing 11 people. Initial estimates peg the insured wind damage from that first strike at $600 million to $2 billion.\n\nWhen the storm made landfall Monday in Louisiana, its fringes flooded streets in the Florida Panhandle and eroded beaches.\n\nThe Chronicle and Associated Press",

the 17th street canal see below lake pontchartrain is entering the city and becoming lake new orleans this is what we all feared the cable news networks have not really caught on yet to what is happening confirmed from the wwl website mayor ray nagin reports the twin span bridge is totally destroyed and that 80 of the city is underwater more from nola a large section of the vital 17th street canal levee where it connects to the brand new ÔøΩhurricane proofÔøΩ old hammond highway bridge gave way late monday morning in bucktown after katrinaÔøΩs fiercest winds were well north the breach sent a churning sea of water coursing across lakeview and into midcity carrollton gentilly city park and neighborhoods farther south and east as night fell on a devastated region the water was still rising in the city and nobody was willing to predict when it would stop im not sure if they really mean late monday morning or if that should read late monday night or perhaps early tuesday morning which would jive better with the hospital officials story she said the water had been rising fast for about two hours on the other hand maybe the breach was a trickle at first and has gotten progressively worse either way this is very bad this should be a streaming video of the mayors comments though its not working for me new orleans is flooding 8302005 013000 am est posted by brendan loy there is a twoblocklong breach in the lake pontchartrain levee and the water in downtown new orleans is rising at the rate of one inch every 5 minutes according to karen troyercaraway vice president of the tulane university medial center she said she got the information about the breach from the state police having herself witnessed the rising water for the last two hours the breach is at 17th street canal she says which is at the geographical border between orleans and jefferson parish the breach is on the orleans parish side so its dumping all the water from the lake into orleans parish and its essentially running down canal street and there are whitecaps on the street its flowing so fast the water is rising so fast i can not begin to describe it and she says the rate of water rise is increasing the hospital is in downtown new orleans the central business district they did not have any substantial street flooding during the storm but now they are contemplating an air evacuation because the ground floor is submerged and the second floor where the emergency generators are located will be submerged soon if the water keeps rising at this rate they have been on emergency generator power since 200 am it sounds to me like the worstcase scenario or something very like it may happen after all is there anything that can stop lake pontchartrain from flooding the city now that there is such a substantial breach this is a catastrophe and its happening right now at least 40000 homes in new orleans flooded 8292005 112700 pm est posted by brendan loy fema director

cant get help shes breaking down she can barely hold herself together enough to talk to aaron brown we reporters are wacky thrillseekers sometimes but when you stand in the dark and you hear people yelling for help and no one can get to them its a totally different experience one of the reasons they cant get to people is because some of the naturalgas and electrical lines are still live and its too dangerous to take boats around in those areas according to cnn photojournalist mark biello could be hundreds of deaths by tomorrow biello water still rising slowly not dramatically like before but still rising lots of dogs and cats also stranded on rooftops along with humans biello says an important question what about the snakes there has been looting in new orleans assholes meanwhile wsdu is reportedly showing footage of a fire spreading from house to house in metairie also cnn is now reporting that conditions at the superdome are getting progressively worse there is some considerable tension among the population inside according to ray bias an emergency worker at the dome and hes not sure how much longer the current situation will remain tenable in comments chris writes people will not be going back home for a long long time to much of new orleans even if the water drops which will take a long time because three of the huge pumps are out there is now sewage waste pollution disease carring agents and vectors of all kinds everywheremany of the older houses will have to be condemned many of the people living in them before will not be able to afford to rebuild the roads rail system and infrastructre of all kinds is severely damaged i heard at least one major bridge on 10 is comprimised that sounds right to me he also criticizes news anchors for constantly saying people are asking when they can go home as if the big story here is the impatience of the evacuees dont they realize that this just delays the reality of what all those people must face they will be in camps or refugees possibly for many months update i10 bridge story confirmed sections of the interstate 10 twin bridges linking st tammany and orleans parishes over lake pontchartrain have been

under seven feet of water evacuees are being told not to come back heres a summary of the mississippi damage hurricane katrina brought catastrophic damage from the coast to hattiesburg gulfport fire chief pat sullivan said downtown buildings were imploding or collapsing particularly in the 19th street area coastwide there were reports of homes and buildings knocked off their foundations by storm surges as high as 28 feet katrina was not overhyped 8292005 074500 pm est posted by brendan loy lets be clear about something i dont want to hear any of this crap about how the media and local officials overhyped this storm first of all the damage along the mississippi coastline was catastrophic the storm surge was worse than camille and basically entire sections of coastline are gone and that was from a weakened katrina secondly new orleans was hit very very hard at least in terms of property damage its too soon to say what the human toll will be but it could have been much much worse unimaginably worse and that is not just hype there are two reasons new orleans was not destroyed but merely devastated two reasons this was not an apocalyptic lostcityofatlantis scenario but merely a really bad flood those reasons are 1 a lastminute northward turn and 2 a lastminute sudden weakening the likes of which i have rarely seen before yes several recent hurricanes have weakened as they approached the gulf coast but this one really weakened fast particularly the lefthand side of the eyewall and look at all the damage it still did i watched both things happen in the wee hours of this morning and believe me neither of them were preordained to happen both of them happened in the final 69 hours before landfall and if either one of them had not happened wed be looking at a very different situation right now we wouldnt be rescuing people from their rooftops because the rooftops would be submerged along with the rest of the city up to 2030 feet this is not a hypothetical scenario it almost happened anyone who suggests that this storm was overhyped is contributing to a deadly culture of complacency that will dissuade people from evacuating the next time around for there will be a next time around new orleans was spared the big one today this was a big one but not the big one but someday the worst will happen it is inevitable its a matter of when not if this should be a wakeup call not an excuse to become complacent and arrogant new orleans should learn from this storm and actually come up with a viable plan to deal with a direct hit from cat 45 hurricane which this ultimately was not shore up the levees wall off a portion of the city whatever something has to be done and sitting around carping about how this storm was overhyped is obscenely

3by5foot chunk according to the wdsu katrina blog authorities are moving people to a different part of the dome getting underneath the terrace level moving away from the open area rain and wind is now starting to pour into the superdome no panic but obvious concern everyone is just kind of looking up in awe that this is supposed to be the safest place in new orleans and now the superdome is giving way to this superstorm theres nowhere for these folks to go this is where theyre going to be whether the roof comes off this dome or not and new orleans is still about an hour away from its closest approach to the eyewall brian williams msnbc katrina has opened at least two holes along one seam in the roof just about six minutes ago the wind peeled one section and now it has opened a second section rain is pouring in through the open section and inside the whole dome now there is mist swirling around but it is not as if the structural integrity of the superdome is in any danger update 917 am the national guard told reporters at a news conference in baton rouge la that the holes in the roof at the superdome are only minor a representative of the national guard blamed the strong

from nola as dawn approached monday the story was the same across metro new orleans heavy wind gusts soaking rain some reports of damage and widespread reports of power outages damage was expected to be significant as one caller told wwl radio early monday the smell of pine is in the air referring to the snapping of pine trees on the north shore also even as bands of heavy rain accompanied by 100mph winds moved into the new orleans area this morning bending trees in half and plucking camper tops from pickup trucks the national hurricane center warned that hurricane katrina still has its biggest punch to come national hurricane center lead forecaster martin nelson warned that slight wobbles left or right as the eye moves northward will make little difference in the height of storm surge south and east of the city and in lake pontchartrain because the storm already has been pushing surge water ahead of it into louisianas southeastern wetlands and the lake for so long there will be storm surge flooding to the west of the eye because of the packing of water thats occurred as katrina drives to the coast he said once over land the western side will see that water rapidly exit driven by the southern counterclockwise winds on that side of the storm watching the progress of the storm from jefferson parishs emergency operations center in marrero walter maestri sounded an early note of optimism at 345 am as katrina jogged a bit off course but he also cautioned that conditions could deteriorate as the day progresses it looks like weve done fairly well he said we have had no reports of serious wind damage and we dont see any indication of tidal surge problems but of course its still really early the next four to five hours will tell the tale us 90 underwater 8292005

twc has lowered its storm surge estimate for no and the lake from 1622 feet to 1015 feet now twc is saying downtown mobile is going to flood pascagoula mississippi civil defense reportered a wind gust to 113 mph within the past hour at their office according to the nhc 700 am update this has quickly gone from being primarily a new orleans issue to being primarily a mississippialabama issue new orleans to be spared 8292005 065200 am est posted by brendan loy barring a major lastminute wobble it does now definitely appear that hurricane katrinas eye and eyewall will pass just to the east of new orleans thus sparing the city the worst of the storm radar here whether the storm surge and waves will nevertheless be enough to overwhelm the levees and if so to what extent remains to be seen but compared to the general despair of 24 and even 12 hell 6 hours ago things are definitely looking up for the possibility that new orleans as we know it will survive to see another day if the worst is averted hopefully this will serve as a wakeup call and not an excuse to become complacent and react slowly and skeptically to future storm warnings superdome reportedly loses power 8292005 064600 am est posted by brendan loy power and thus air conditioning is out at the superdome according to a commenter citing local media in baton rouge meanwhile in gulfport the water is rising substantially landfall for real this time 8292005 062700 am est posted by brendan loy landfall officially occurred at 610 am according to twc wtf 8292005 060700 am est posted by brendan loy confirming the weakness of katrinas western eyewall the highest wind gust recorded thus far at grand isle is 77 mph which while not exactly a pleasant day at the park is also not indicative of being in or very near the eyewall of category 4 hurricane im really confused how can a hurricane have a minimum central pressure of 917 mb lower than andrew and yet be this disorganized how can katrina weaken as much as she has without the pressure rising more steeply is there something im not understanding here because this seems bizarre to me ps in the peanut gallery on dr jeff masters s blog a couple of commenters are crying conspiracy noting that the sudden weakening began during the nightly satellite blackout and suggesting that perhaps the government secretly weakened the hurricane somehow i believe the dod knows why the entire nw portion of katrinas eyewall disapeared in 1 radar loop just hours prior to landfall funny how she was so healthy prior to the black out thats when they went in so they could not be noticed and blamed if it went wrong and caused her to explode in intensity katrina looks less impressive now than ivan did prior to making landfall she will begin to fall apart now the us govt will never allow a cat5 storm to make landfall ever again near a metro area she will dramatically weaken and make landfall in a relatively unpopulated area e of the nhc projected path for the history books few things will add up about this storm the wind pressure differencethe last minute jog to the e or the dissappearence of the strongest portion of the storm completely off radar in one loop all during the satellight blackout just hours before making landfall very interesting stuff even more interesting will be the explanations we will hear tommorrow by the way i wonder how many cat 4 storms ever had central pressures in the 26s while still being listed as a cat4 a 100 mb difference exists between cat4 hurricane charley 145 mph and cat4 katrina right now a cat4 with 12 of an eyewall and pressures in the 26s i hope tommorrow the proper questions are asked trust me the kat was declawed and we should all be greatful obviously i dont buy into the conspiracy theory as one skeptic responded if they had that technology why would they wait so long just because we dont understand it yet doesnt make it a secret government plot occams razor dude heh anyway i just found the conspiracy theory rather entertaining here are some facts about past government attempts to control or weaken hurricanes all of which have spectacularly failed flooding at one no hospital power running low at another 8292005 054900 am est posted by brendan loy sean rajki whose wife mary is a nurse on duty in the neonatal intensive care unit at west jefferson medical center on the west bank of the mississippi river reports via email i just heard from mary 512 am she is ok but the hospital is on its last leg of backup power how absurdly inadequate they heard that at east jefferson in metairie across the river from them that there was flooding on the lowest level of the hospital confirmed on wwl tv they are all both shifts heading to their unit nicu and will continue to work some of the babies two i think are on ventilators so they will have to be handbagged from the moment the power goes out until she said the national guard is at the hospital so that if evacuation needs to happen they have some help she seemed reassured that the guard is there also she said that some people reported some scary noises coming through the building hopefully just the noise of the storm i am amazed she called me on her cell phone told her to turn it off after we hang up to conserve her battery pray earlier he wrote i am stuck at home in baton rouge my parents are here but the full scale of what is about to hit new orleans with my wife there in the way is quite a burden she is the love of my life and i cant even think about losing her by the way she is three months pregnant with our first child i know this will be bad no matter what katrina isnt going to turn around and go home it would take a miracle today to keep all the people safe please pray for mary and the others landfall 8292005 054100 am est posted by brendan loy the weather channel and cnn are officially declaring landfall correction stu ostro said its not quite officially landfall yet new orleans radar broken 8292005 052800 am est posted by brendan loy there has not been a new radar image from the new orleans radar for 40 minutes so that may be all she wrote as far as that radar site goes the mobile radar doesnt give us as good a view of the eyewall structure but at least the images are current landfall is imminent heres an extreme closeup update the new orleans radar is back it just took a little hiatus i guess river rising in baton rouge high winds in jefferson parish 8292005 052100 am est posted by brendan loy cnns anderson cooper is reporting that the mississippi river has risen significantly in baton rouge in the last halfhour can that be from the stormsurging gulf waters flowing upstream from the delta which katrina is currently pounding if so surely the river is rising much more in new orleans which is further downstream meanwhile the winds have gotten much worse in the last 20 minutes in jefferson parish with doors blowing out and such according to wwl another report from gulfport 8292005 051700 am est posted by brendan loy lisa boone reports in again from near gulfport ms via email we have just lost power at 430 fortunately the generator kicked on and so far so good we are getting tropical storm force gusts and have had several inches of rain the local tv coverage now says that the storm will hit us at category 3 strength strong category 3 one presumes still predicting a very large tidal surge they have shown pictures of the water rising at the beach you might want to add their stream to your list they are httpwwwwloxcom weve had a couple tornado warnings set to expire within minutes now things will still get much worse before they get better but they are now saying it wont be another camille and for people who rode out camille and lived through the aftermath that is a huge relief i cant figure how to get a direct link to the wlox stream but if you go to their homepage you can get it nearing the delta 8292005 044900 am est posted by brendan loy i wish there was a storm surge gauge at the mouth of the mississippi river because the rightfront quadrant of the eyewall is absolutely pummelling that area right now ill tell you one thing water is definitely not flowing out of the mississippi into the gulf right now radar here the eye will come ashore over those mississippi delta swamplands very shortly but hmm is that really considered a landfall its barely land trying to restrengthen 8292005 043100 am est posted by brendan loy heres an extreme closeup of the eye it looks like the eyewall is trying to close itself back off but its running out of time over the water its still confoundingly wobbling left right left right update yup katrina is definitely trying to pull herself back together at the last minute check out the infrared and water vapor satellite loops obsessing over the wobbles 8292005 041600 am est posted by brendan loy now it looks like it wants to wobble nne in the last 20 minutes or so argh this is a very close call nhc close call for no 8292005 040600 am est posted by brendan loy its going to be very close as to whether the surge will be high enough to overtop those levees richard knabb national hurricane center meteorologist on cnn update the 400 am discussion is out and it emphasizes that katrina should not be underestimated even as it weakens a bit some fluctuations in intensity are possible right up until landfall occurs howeverit appears that katrina will make landfall as a category 4 hurricane later this morning the cloud pattern in satellite imagery has eroded on the west side due to dry air entrainmentand the eyewall has opened up to the south and southwest in radar imagery howeverthe water remains quite warm underneath the centerand convection can easily redevelop and the eyewall close off again before landfall occurs some disruption of the circulation will occur once the center moves over southeastern louisiana howeverthe forecast track keeps the eye close enough to warm water near the louisiana and mississippi coasts the upperlevel outflow pattern remains quite impressive and even contains a rare 200 mb indraft anticyclone to the east near tampa bay the combination of the outflow regime and the close proximity to warm water may be enough to keep katrina a major hurricane when it reaches the louisianamississippi border area this afternoon just because katrina is no longer a catgeory 5 hurricane does not mean that extensive damage and storm surge flooding will not occur this is still an extremely dangerous and potentially deadly hurricane katrina update 8292005 040100 am est posted by brendan loy pressure now up to 917 mb winds down to 150 mph according to the 400 am advisory still waiting for the new discussion looking again at the radar this time superimposing the 253 am eye on top of the 347 am radar and then drawing arrows extrapolating from the eyes movement during that 54minute period if anything katrina appears to be moving more to the west not less it could yet wobble back north but man its going to be a closerun thing live from new orleans 8292005 034700 am est posted by brendan loy paradecam in new orleans is still working and not surprisingly its looking very windy and rainy too soon to say whether eye will miss new orleans 8292005 033200 am est posted by brendan loy i know its dangerous to read too much into radar wobbles but frankly at this point a wobble here or there could make the difference between a catastrophic flood and well a badbutnotcatastrophic flood so i took a look at the last 15 frames ie 77 minutes from the new orleans composite radar and i superimposed the 326 am eye on top of the 209 am radar image and then drew lines to figure out what direction the eye has been moving during that time period heres what i came up with and its not like most of that westerly component occurred early in the 77minute period there has definitely been a continued westerly component to the motion in recent radar frames so i think its too early to say that the eye and eyewall will pass east of new orleans update cnns meteorologist just said new orleans may be back into the eyewall landfall with that little westward wobble personally i think its more like new orleans always was in the eyewall landfall zone but we briefly misinterpreted a northward wobble as indicating otherwise another mans opinion 8292005 032000 am est posted by brendan loy in his final update of the night steve gregory agrees with me about katrinas weakening trend latest storm surge calculations from the usgs hazards site are calling for an 1822ft storm surge i believe this may prove to be too high the new orleans levees are likely to be breached but not of catastrophic proportions but they will be breached causing major flooding however the odds are going up that the eye will pass just east of downtown new orleans satellite imagery clearly shows a loss of outflow and eroding away of the deep layer moisture as the trof from the west is making a significant impact on the storm and a change in heading to nne 010 deg that i do not believe is a wobble positive note many of these areas are reporting water temps in the 8385 deg range down considerably from the high 80s this morning this will help slow any potential intensification my current and last forecast until morning landfall will result in 120mph sustained winds and gusts to 150mph below hurricane camille this will occur just ene of the eye wall so the worst wind damage will be experienced slidell to gulfport with the smaller communities east of a line from east new orleans southward to woodland storm surge will be under around 1518 feet across lake borgne and 1620 feet near the lams state line im not sure about the nne motion im still seeing some nnw components to the motion on radar but the rest of his forecast sounds right to me especially the 120mph sustained winds oops 8292005 030700 am est posted by brendan loy katrina is wobbling to the northnorthwest again on the last several radar frames so much for due north im recalling something i wrote on friday if katrina gets close enough a lastminute wobble could save or doom the big easy good news 8292005 025200 am est posted by brendan loy the weather channel says the hurricane hunter recon aircraft confirm what the radar is saying that the south and southwest side of the eyewall is a bit ragged frankly i dont think this is really a 155 mph hurricane anymore i could be wrong and remember im not a metereologist just an amateur hurricane buff but i really think this thing is weaker than the nhc is saying naturally they dont want people to let down their guard the lastminute weakening processes that we all hoped for are indeed happening dry air shear eyewall replacement whatever it is some factors have conspired to disrupt katrinas circulation hopefully that trend will continue remember the eyewall has several more hours before it reaches heavily populated areas so if the weakening trend continues that would be excellent news in terms of the amount of wind damage that will occur it will still be severe but not the kind of catastrophic andrewtype everythinggetsflattened damage that the nws described earlier today by way of comparison heres what andrew looked like on radar when it hit however the bigger concern here is the flooding of new orleans and from everything ive read even a category 3 hurricane would be enough to top the levees moreover the weakening of the west side of the storm wont help with that because its the easterly winds ahead of the storm on the east side that will do most of the work in flooding lake pontchartrain so unless the experts who studies these scenarios are wrong i think new orleans is still going to flood again this is just one amateur weather buffs opinion and i could be wrong due north 8292005 024200 am est posted by brendan loy the hurricane center is now saying that the eye is moving due north if that holds it looks like the downtown area of new orleans would maybe be hit by the far western side of the eyewall depending on exactly how wide the eyewall is of which i am not certain a northnortheasterly turn would really help again remember the winds and rain around the eyewall are undoubtedly more severe than they appear on radar right now i believe that the radar has trouble penetrating the eyewall and it has generally been my experience that hurricanes often dont look as impressive on radar as they really are latest radar here storm surge update 8292005 023200 am est

posted by brendan loy no pundit muses there is a schrodingers cat quality to watching the spinning red ball does the new orleans that i know even exist right now hours before landfall surely the buildings are there right now and the people who remained are fine right now but in a sense some of those buildings have already fallen and some of those people have already met tragedy indeterminacy tonight determinacy tomorrow i am in a stunned fog resigned not that my life will change in the morning but that my life has already changed perhaps a little perhaps a lot but even if i have a relatively intact house to return to there will be friends who dont and there may be friends who arent commingled with my resignation is an optimism and resilience whatever happens well happens wherever my starting point happens to be tomorrow is just that a starting point not without pain not without tears not without doubts a fine place to take a step forward yes i am praying and hoping for miracle a weakening an eastern deviation and that may yet come do you believe in miracles i do in other news heres a picture of people packed inside the superdome west side of storm erodes down to high cat 4 8292005 015200 am est posted by brendan loy wow the west side of the storm really does look very ragged all of a sudden is that a patch of dry air caused by the counterclockwise flow blowing off the land perhaps this could help new orleans at least a bit if it holds and if the satellite picture is representative of the wind speeds at the surface though im suspecting the city will still flood as the storm surge is coming in from the east where the storm still looks very strong so i dont want to get peoples hopes up but this is at least a sliver of hope update yup dry air check out the water vapor view heres the latest view how deeply entrained into the circulation that patch of dry air gets could be crucial remember new orleans figures to be probably on the lefthand side of the eye update as as 200 am katrina is down to category 4 with 155 mph sustained winds thats the very top end of category 4 status but could it be lower were waiting on new data from recon plane the weather channel guys says there is erosion of the cloud cover on the western side of the storm but the radar not really reflecting that heres another water vapor view again dont get your hopes up this

posted by brendan loy discussing the superdome in comments on a previous post todd observes i can not even begin to imagine what a hellhole that place will soon become paul at wizbang is imagining its a near certainty the electricity will go out about midday monday the dome has backup power but it is only for lighting no environmental controls and the backup lighting is not full power the dome is about 20 stories high but people will be scattered all thru it if the worst happens and at this point it seems implausible that it wont the bottom 2 stories will fill with water dirty nasty foul water full of chemicals and raw sewerage further the bathroom facilities are only expected to function for the first day so in rough terms 40000 people will be trapped in a building with no plumbing little light and no air conditioning the temps after the storm rolls thru will probably be in the low 90s considerably hotter in the building there is an elevated paved deck that surrounds the dome it will most probably be above water but inaccessible until probably daylight tuesday once the people can get out to the deck they will still be trapped there because the city will be underwater they will be an island we have no idea how long it will take to remove the water from the city ive seen estimates from 10 weeks to 10 months yes months there is a helipad maybe 2 where choppers can land to drop potable water food tents and other supplies but sanitation will be scarce to put it mildly we really have no idea how long people will be there in theory they can be removed by boat but how do you move 40000 people by boats that will be navigating their way thru a flooded city and where do you put them and this is assuming the building has no structural problems these are all guesses obviously weve never done it before but it is pretty much commonly accepted these people will face days or probably weeks of hellish conditions few of us can imagine and to think that some reporters are going there voluntarily of course maybe their news helicopters can airlift them out speaking of which isnt that hypothetically an option for everyone granted it would take a while but hat tip instapundit

of course all the people and places that we love in new orleans ill check in later bearing down 8282005 112900 pm est posted by brendan loy heres the latest look at katrina on satellite and radar again do not make the mistake of thinking that the southern side of katrina is weak just because it looks ragged on radar thats typical of a hurricane thats still a ways away from the coast in fact if im not mistaken i believe the radar can have a tough time penetrating the torrential rains on the near side of the eyewall even as the storm gets closer anyway the satellite is much better gauge of the strength of the south side which actually appears to be the strongest part of the storm pressure is up from 904 mb to 908 mb thats good news but keep it in perspective camille made landfall at 909 mb and andrew made landfall at 922 mb this is still a monster and there is no reason to believe it wont continue to be a monster ill be here all night 8282005 110200 pm est posted by brendan loy i

home to their families somewhere else in a city that isnt destroyed theyre the real victims here blech katrinas exact intensity uncertain eyewall replacement cycle possible 8282005 100600 pm est posted by brendan loy the 1000 pm nhc discussion notes that there is some confusion about the strength of katrina right now and also that an eyewall replacement cycle may be starting there are conflicting signals regarding the intensity of katrina the noaa aircraft near 00z reported a peak flight level wind of 155 ktwhich would normally correspond to 140 kt at the surface the pressure remains extremely low904 mb at last report on the other handthe steppedfrequency microwave radiometeror sfmrsuggested winds were in the 120130 kt rangeand limited dropsonde data also suggested something a little below 140 kt there are enough questions about the performance of the sfmr at these speeds for me to stick with the standard 90 percent adjustment for now there have been some modest changes in the structure of katrina over the last several hours recent microwave passes show that an outer eyewall is in the formative stagesand the latest ir images show a less welldefined eyewall with more evidence of outer banding the noaa hurricane hunters also reported an erosion of the eyewall in the southwest quadrant these observations suggest that there could be some weakening of katrina prior to landfall all this is relativehoweverand katrina is still expected to be of at least category four intensity when it reaches the coast an eyewall replacement at this point is not all good newsas they are generally accompanied by a broadening of the wind fieldso that even as katrina weakens there could be an increase in the area that experiences major hurricane force winds the discussion also notes that while there is great significance for the city of new orleans in the details of the tracktrack anomolies of 3050 miles are still possible even 1218 hours out gassing up

minutes after posting this i saw on cnn that tomorrows timespicayune is indeed out click for fullsize pdf version as for whether there will be a timespicayune on tuesday the real qusetion as squid

by brendan loy katrina has shut the french quarters legendary hurricane party bar it takes a mean mean storm to shut down the hurricane party at mollys at the market but katrina did it at about 6 pm sunday the french quarter bar notorious for staying open during hurricanes despite dire warnings and curfew calls was the last in the french quarter to close said jim monaghan jr owner of the bar at the corner of ursulines and decatur streets i thought about it long and hard he said but i dont want 100 people in here if something happens in the past the bar has remained open and usually chock full of regulars defying the storm and soothing their nerves with drink we would have stuck it out if it was a category two or three but theres 175 mph winds out there and i dont want to be liable if somebody does something stupid in here tonight monaghan said and theres a bunch of drunks wandering around here at nearby cafe lafitte tip andrews knew it was time to leave when he saw the green shutters on the mustardcolored building close when they close you know its bad the bourbon street resident said sunday as he took his two dogs gigi and dijon for a last walk before heading north they never board up on a related note i got an email this afternoon from houston hardin who said a friend from louisiana who evacuated north into alabama ran into a fellow louisianan at a gas station who was upset that he couldnt buy booze at that county in alabama on sundays heh 160 mph 8282005 073400 pm est posted by brendan loy but still 904 millbars update steve gregory writes katrina has gone steady state and has been at this intensity for almost 8 hours the eye diameter has actually gone up a bit to 28nm which is truly remarkable for a storm of such intensity there are no indications that the storm is or will soon begin any type of eye wall replacement cycle the expansion from 22nm to 28nm is probably responsible for the slightly lower wind speeds being observed at flight level near the core even though the pressure has not changed 167kts vs 160kts but then he adds at the moment satellite imagery and the recon data shows that the eyewall is clearly expanding it never was able to get lower than 20nm early this morning last night i conjectured that we may have seen an eye wall replacement cycle start this evening and if it went slowly the storm would weaken some before making landfall this is in addition to the potential for some light wind shear impacting the system before landfall at the risk of hitting enter on this only to see katrina begin a real eye wall cycling begin i am wondering if what we are going to actually see is a pulsation effect where the exiting eye wall expands out to say 40nm and then shrinks back down towards 20nm by morning and because there are absolutely no other known environmental variable except some light shear in the nw quadrant by morning this would result in some additional easing of winds during the next few hours followed by an increase back up to as much as 175mph winds again by daybreak if this process actually unfoldsi dont think i will be going to get much sleep tonight but even if my eye wall pulsation cycle theory i just created out of thin air comes to pass there still is the issue of increasing wind shear affecting the storm in the last 6 hours before land fall as the developing trof in the central us which led to katrinas curve northward to begin with could simply over power the storms massive circulation just enough to weaken katrina anyway but given the immense size and intensity of this once per century type storm there may be no stopping this storm since super storms like katrina create their very own self sustaining environment and can deflect small outside influences such light wind shear or areas of dry air the consequences of the delayed evacuation order 8282005 072500 pm est posted by brendan loy fellow blogger matt drachenberg of overtaken by events is deeply worried about his motherinlaw who is trapped in a nursing home just west of new orleans he writes i just had a very frank conversation with the administrator of jefferson healthcare where my motherinlaw is trapped they were forced to make a decision yesterday as far as evacuation mr ray was honest enough to tell me that had he had all of the information he would have made a different decision but as it stands my wifes mother will be riding out katrina in a onestory bulding with a broken pelvis requiring a serious regimen of prescription medication i really wanted to get angry about this conversation however once i realized that should my wife lose her mother mr ray would also be dead i found it impossible to be upset i thanked him for his service and his commitment and said that hed be in our prayers there are people in that facility that make less in a year than a lot of people make in a week of blogads but theyre staying with the patients to which theyve made a commitment read that again they made their decision yesterday and would have decided differently if they had better information and explain to me again how the mayor of new orleans didnt completely fk this up does anyone doubt that if he had ordered a mandatory evacuation yesterday morning the nursing home would have made a different decision and matts motherinlaw would be safe now in other news jolie a louisianan who commented here under

comments and wanted to add it here yes the penchant for understatement has been driving me crazy for the last two days the media has really dropped the ball on this along with the local government sometimes it is necessary to recognize that the normal policy of lets try not to spread panic must give way to a policy of okay lets face it panic is completely appropriate at this point so that people realize exactly what theyre dealing with barring a lastminute change of intensity or track which grows more unlikely with each passing moment this will be the worst hurricane in american history in terms of the extent of death and destruction that it will cause there is no use comparing it to previous hurricanes sunset over katrina 8282005 055400 pm est posted by brendan loy by the time the sun rises over this monster tomorrow morning shell be ravaging the coastline quite possibly causing devastation thats unprecedented in modern american history our only hope is a welltimed eyewall replacement cycle and even that might not be enough to save new orleans and so far theres no sign of such a cycle though the pressure seemingly has finally bottomed out rising from 902 mb to 903mb to 904 mb over the last few hours fleeing the storm 8282005 043100 pm est posted by brendan loy ken of no pundit who left new orleans at my urging in the wee hours of this morning emailed that he has reached galveston good others who waited until the mayors belated evacuation order are not so lucky if youre still in new orleans thinking about leaving its getting very close to the point where its too late if indeed that point has not already come tropical stormforce winds are expected to begin overnight tonight sometime not too long after midnight jim cantore cited 800 pm as the time by which you should be hunkered down depending on the traffic reports in the direction youre thinking about heading it may be time to start thinking about vertical evacuations heading up into high floors of office buildings or what have you and riding it out then again im not sure how well those buildings will withstand 200 mph wind gusts the superdome is also an option argh there are no words for the type of calamity that this thing is going to be update mike writes the following be careful of vertical evacuations higher floors mean higher winds and the frictional forces of air to ground contact abate the experts on the no cbs affiliate are stating that 2nd to 4th floor windowless rooms are good but any higher causes additional danger due to increasing winds that offsets the advantage of being out of the water rising tide 8282005 041500 pm est posted by brendan loy the storm surge is already beginning nothing significant yet but its low tide and the water isnt receding which is never a good sign the next high tide will be considerably higher see also here and more generally here lake pontchartrains water level is rising too but thats nothing to what itll look like in 12 hours winds down to 165 mph pressure still 902 mb 8282005 035200 pm est posted by brendan loy katrinas maximum sustained winds are down to only 165 mph according to the 400 pm advisory oddly this is true even though the pressure remains at 902 mb so im not sure what to make of it could this be the start of a weakening trend an eyewall replacement cycle perhaps we can only hope and pray update ah it hasnt weakened at all the nhc has merely reevaluated the data it sounds like katrina was probably never really 175 mph to begin with from the discussion data from the steppedfrequency microwave radiometer instrument on board the aircraft suggest that the surface to 700 mb flight level wind ratio is not quite as large as we typically useand the initial intensity is adjusted slightly to 145 kt well damn its not a weakening trend then just an adjustment in the estimation formula the discussion goes on to note that hurricanes do not maintain such great intensity for very long but that ignores the scary possibility that katrina is an annular hurricane either way there are no obvious largescale mechanismssuch as increased vertical shearto weaken katrina the hurricane is likely to make landfall with category 4 or 5 intensity i have to say this at some point 8282005 034700 pm est posted by brendan loy i dont mean to trivialize what is going to happen to new orleans and environs by

were more intense pressurewise were hurricane allen in 1980 899 mb the great labor day hurricane of 1935 892 mb and hurricane gilbert 888 mb only the 35 hurricane made landfall at that intensity allen and gilbert weakened somewhat before coming ashore hopefully katrina will do the same but its very hard to see any reason why she would weaken substantially with the pressure dropping to 902 mb i think the winds may yet have some further increasing to do unbelieveable though that might seem the record for maximum sustained winds in the atlantic is 190 mph we could see katrina reach that model guidance for intensity is not encouraging writes charles fenwick at eye of the storm latest ships output is for 180 mph winds in 12 hours with no indication of weakening before landfall as for the track the 12z runs of gfs gfdl and nogaps models do not provide much hope for new orleans heres the gfs for 700 am tomorrow 175 mph sustained winds 8282005 094800 am est posted by brendan loy so says the 1000 am advisory gusts to 215 mph pressure at 907 mb this is going to be an unprecedented event in the history of the city of new orleans and we want everybody to get out mayor nagin okay now im really going to take that nap see you in a few hours mandatory evacuation for new orleans 8282005 092600 am est posted by brendan loy mayor nagin has finally ordered everyone out the storm surge will most likely top our levee system he says the live footage of cars streaming out of the city on both side of the interstate with the superdome and the city skyline in the background superimposed on cnns splitscreen with the mayor and the governor ordering everyone out of the city is really very very eerie strikingly apocalyptic naptime 8282005 084200 am est posted by brendan loy i stayed up all night watching katrina blow up from a cat 3 into a cat 5 and with another marathon night and morning of hurricaneblogging ahead i need to sleep now ill try to wake up in time for the 400 pm advisory at the latest hopefully before then in the mean time you can follow the long collection of links at left to stay abreast of the storm in particular check out eye of the storm dr jeff masters and steve gregory for the latest and of course the national hurricane center ill be back in a few hours katrina likely to strengthen further 8282005 073100 am est posted by brendan loy heres the latest on katrina minimum central pressure is down to 908 mb making katrina the sixth most intense hurricane in the recorded history of the atlantic basin maximum sustained winds are still 160 mph with gusts to 195 mph hurricane force winds extend up to 85 miles away from the center and tropicalstorm force winds go 185 mph out and the strike probability for new orleans is at 29 and rising with each advisory the visible satellite picture is just incredible dr jeff masters says katrina is likely to strengthen even further he says she is in the midst of a truly historic rapid deepening phasethe pressure has dropped 34 mb in the 11 hours ending at 7am edt and he suggests that at the rate katrina is deepening she could easily be the third or fourth most intense hurricane ever later today and even if the pressure doesnt fall any further the winds are likely to increase to catch up to the rapidly falling pressure and could approach the alltime record of 190 mph set in camille and allen winds of this level will create maximum storm surge heights over 25 feet and this storm surge will affect an area at least double the area wiped clean by camille which was roughly half the size of katrina katrina has continued to expand in size and is now a huge hurricane like ivan damage will be very widespread and extreme if katrina can maintain category 5 strength at landfall so can she maintain category 5 strength until landfall normally the answer would be no but charles fenwick raises the scary possibility that katrina might be something called an annular hurricane which i must admit id never heard of before meaning that it might be able to avoid eyewall replacement cycles and maintain category five status all the way to landfall annular hurricanes do not fluctuate as rapidly as normal major hurricanes the most recent case was ivan which retained category five status for 30 consecutive hours the telltale sign of an annular hurricane is that the convection is uniform making a perfect circle ie there are no spiraling bands just a donut that is almost exactly the case with katrina as one can see from infrared satellite another feature is a larger than average eye average being 14 miles the message from the recon plane shown in my last full update shows that katrinas eye is 25 nautical miles in diameter so it is well above average as far as conditions associated with annular hurricanes go some of the conditions are most certainly there average sea surface temperatures associated with them are 269¬∞ c katrina is certainly on the more favorable side of that ref weak vertical wind shear is another key factor that is certainly the case in the immdiate vicinity of katrina so enough of the theory what does this mean practically it means that the situation has gotten even worse if katrina is indeed annular then the chances of her retreating down to say category three status are nil if we make the somewhat unlikely presumption that she has reached her maximum strength and again if she is annular then the averages of such hurricanes suggest that she would only weaken to 145 mph at landfall that would be a storm with charleylike intensity but on a much larger scale as charley was puny compared to the present size of katrina this could prove to be the greatest american natural disaster of our lifetimes the sort of thing that will be remembered for generations assuming for the moment that katrina is not an annular hurricane dr masters offers a good overview of the possibilities katrinas intensity at landfall is likely to be category 4 but could easily be category 3 or 5 she will undergo another eyewall replacement cycle before landfall and this will weaken her maximum winds by 20 30 mph for a 12hour period additionally some increase in shear is possible in the 12 hours prior to landfall which could weaken katrinas winds another 10 20 mph if we are extremely lucky both factors will conspire to knock katrina down to a category 3 and she will hit at low tide given that the storm is so large and is already pushing up a huge storm surge wave in front of it even a weakened category 3 katrina hitting at low tide will cause an incredible amount of damage a stretch of coast 170 miles long will experience hurricane force winds given the current radius of hurricane force winds around the storm a direct hit on new orleans in this bestcase scenario may still be enough to flood the city resulting in heavy loss of life and 30 billion or more in damage an angry rant 8282005 072500 am est posted by brendan loy what the hell is the point of even having such a thing as mandatory evacuations if youre not going to order them right now or better yet about 24 hours ago for new orleans gulfport and biloxi dont the officials down there get it one of the most intense hurricanes in recorded history is 24 hours away from quite possibly destroying their cities if its not appropriate to order a mandatory evacuation now when would it ever be appropriate to do so a huge stillstrengthening category 5 hurricane a highconfidence forecast track an extremely vulnerable densely populated area in the very center of the track bottom line this is nuts hundreds or perhaps thousands of people are going to die because their local officials inexplicably refuse to pull the trigger and tell them they have to get out sunrise over cat 5 katrina 8282005 065100 am est posted by brendan loy the sun is just rising over monstrous hurricane katrina for the fullsize wide view click here and zoom in category five 160 mph 8282005 062000 am est posted by brendan loy well that was quick 910 millibars 160 mph source twc update and as if that wasnt scary enough the water with the greatest total heat content is still ahead katrina could get even stronger this thing could rival the 1935 keys hurricane before it finishes deepening as for how strong it will be when it comes ashore that will depend entirely on the timing of those totally unpredictable eyewall replacement cycles 915 millibars katrina will be a cat 5 soon 8282005 061200 am est posted by brendan loy according to the latest reconaissance data katrinas minimum central pressure is down to 915 mb thats lower than andrew was at landfall 922 mb and almost as low as camille 909 mb a pressure of 915 mb equates to category five intensity it may take the winds a few hours to catch up but i expect that by the 1000 am advisory or a couple of hours thereafter at the latest well be looking at a category five hurricane if it made landfall right now katrina would be the thirdmost intense hurricane ever to hit the united states quote of the day 8282005 060500 am est posted by brendan loy if youre not scared you should be jim cantore the weather channel update heres an audio clip of what cantore said and heres a picture of him with his classic bugeyed look 150 mph and counting 8282005 050400 am est posted by brendan loy the hurricane center just upped katrinas max winds to 150 mph says the 400 am discussion the intensity forecast anticipates that katrina could approach category five status prior to landfall the ships guidance actually does forecast 160 mph at 24 hours but it is also possible that internal structural changes ie eyewall replacement cycles could cause fluctuations in the intensity so the official forecast peaks at 155 mph category five begins at 156 mph ed while the details of the landfall intensity can not be not known at this time katrina will be a very dangerous hurricane at landfall hurricaneforce winds now extend out 85 miles from the center and tropicalstorm force winds extend 185 miles out this is a huge storm as well as an enormously powerful one a wide swath of territory is going to suffer severely when it strikes with an eye that big and development this explosive the mornings first visible satellite pictures should be very dramatic ill be watching for them here click to zoom last chance 8282005 125700 am est posted by brendan loy if you are on the central gulf coast especially in new orleans do not wait for daylight leave now there will be mass panic when the stragglers wake up in the morning and find out that katrina is cat 4 or maybe cat 5 by then and 24 hours from landfall the roads will fill up very quickly now is your last best chance to beat the rush get the hell out katrina now a strong cat 4 145 mph winds 8282005 124800 am est posted by brendan loy talk about rapid intensification shortly after 1215 am cdt 0515z an air force reconnaissance aircraft reported that maximum sustained winds in hurricane katrina had increased to near 145 mph category four on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale details will follow shortly in a special advisory to be issued at approximately 1 am cdt0600z cripes and shes still got nearly an entire day of perfect conditions ahead hat tip cfr update 124 am the full advisory is out now hurricaneforce winds extend outward up to 70 miles from the center thats up from 45 miles three hours ago and there are wind gusts to 170 mph according to the marine advisory update 256 am weatherblogger steve gregory writes on the most recent sat imagery the eye appears to be nearly 50nm across if the eye was to shrink down to 15nm we would probably see a storm as strong as camille 35foot wave heights over the gulf according to the weather channel my personal prediction i think it will definitely get to category 5 later today whether it makes landfall as a cat 5 will depend on eyewall replacement cycle timing it will probably go through at least one more cycle before landfall but will that cycle be just before landfall or long enough before landfall that it has time to restrenghten again after the cycle is over ps katrina has just become a category 4 hurricane and on cnn theyre talking about martha stewart cnn headline news is showing a clip of p diddy fox news is on commercial msnbc has stone phillips babbling about some humaninterest story and we wonder why some people arent taking this storm seriously enough a success story 8282005 124100 am est posted by brendan loy well ive successfully helped convince one person in new orleans to evacuate woohoo a few hours ago i sent ken of no pundit the analysis by charles fenwick of eye of the storm indicating that all the elements are in place for katrina to become a category five a few minutes ago ken wrote back consider me convinced i am leaving in the next hour or two for galveston where i have friends as much as id like to believe that no will slip past another one and boy our city has charmed many residents into believing it can never happen this one seems to have too many perfect storm elements your links were the clincher blogs are good for rapid education hes making a wise choice others in the crescent city and environs should follow suit get out thats a lot of isobars 8282005 121500 am est posted by brendan loy unisyss forecast surface map for 36 hours from now based on the gfs global model is rather ominous hat tip coriolis wind and heres the 42hour gfs map on a lighter note 8282005 121200 am est posted by brendan loy the weather channels stephanie abrams is filing reports from gulf shores al in a notentirelyunflattering gray tshirt is she planning on having a wet tshirt contest with herself when the katrinas rain bands roll in update thanks to bill woods heres a photo no place to go no way to get there 8272005 115300 pm est posted by brendan loy che of the shattered prayer is one of those thousands of new orleanians with no place to go and no way to get there she writes fear is very frustrating when its a helpless fear when you know from the bottom of your sinking heart that there is absolutely nothing you can do except pray except maybe put your head between your knees and kiss your ass goodbye fear is lonely when you see other people in their cars heading out of town packing up together boarding up their houses together going to the store to buy beer together when your friends who live elsewhere just dont understand why youre so fing afraid and fear is sorrowful when your best friend your cat isnt very wellprotected by the powers that be when the shelters dont allow pets my most grievous fear is for my cat earlier on a lighter note she wrote about the supplies she needed to buy bottled water food that doesnt have to be cooked batteries beer maybe its kind of a tradition in new orleans to get drunk for a hurricane god forbid anyone should be sober and alert during a lifethreatening emergency heh in all seriousness pray for che because she doesnt want to leave her cat whose name is bea and cant take her to a shelter she plans to hunker down in my rickety little cottage and hope for the best the best being not getting covered in 20 feet of water update good news che has found herself a ride out of town my neighbors have all decided to leave and are kind enough to take me with them were leaving first thing in the morning several carloads full im relieved but still frightened i dont know what will be waiting when i return there is something that feels primal and instinctual about fleeing ahead of the storm since the earliest ages of prehistory people have looked out to sea and said its comin up a bad cloud as they say in middle georgia then started running in the other direction no shame in it get me the hell out of here no shame at all no pundit adds his two cents on that point by the by its not wrong to leave when you dont know whether things could go wrong and you can still get out it is dreadfully wrong to wait until you are certain you must get out and you cant well said pressure drops again 8272005 110100 pm est posted by brendan loy 936 mb and looking very impressive on satellite if its not a category four yet it will be very soon ps charles fenwick writes while the traditional worst case refence for a hurricane is camille the potential path of katrina makes me reach further back for such a reference 105 years to be specific i am referring of course to the galveston storm of 1900 if katrina bears on new orleans that is the sort of devestation we will see while the death toll need not be high inaction by individuals and the government could lead to that pray for last minute shear pray for an ever so slight delay in the sharpening of the turn to the north such that katrina heads towards the less populated areas of the coast various lord of the rings movie quotes come unbidden to my mind like there is always hope aragorn or courage is the best defense you have now gandalf alas this is not a fantasy movie the death and destruction wherever it may occur new orleans would be the worst scenario by several orders of magnitude but any landfall by this thing will be bad will be very real nhc urges no mayor to issue mandatory evacuation 8272005 105800 pm est posted by brendan loy okay so let me get this straight the governor calls the mayor during dinner and basically says hey idiot call the fin hurricane center it took a phone call from the governor to convince him to make this call well anyway the mayor calls the nhc and they basically tell him get everyone out of your city now so now finally the mayor is apparently planning to order first mandatory evacuation in city history tomorrow morning about damn time story new orleans mayor ray nagin said he may call for the firstever mandatory evacuation in city history after talking with the head of the hurricane center who said a storm surge of 2025 feet could be expected with major hurricane katrina nagin said he would consider ordering evacuations by sunday morning and may employ buses and trains to help get people out of the city in an interview on eyewitness news nagin said his saturday night dinner was interrupted by an urgent call from governor kathleen blanco who asked nagin to call the hurricane center nagin said the hurricane center chief told the mayor that if it was possible at all he should order an evacuation due to winds that could reach 145 miles per hour sustained and 170 mile per hour gusts nagin said he would put his wife and family on a plane and he urged everyone to do anything they could to get out all models say this storm will land right on top of new orleans he said nagin said he would call churches and urge them to have their congregations adopt seniors or someone who doesnt have transportation and get them out i dont want to wake up one day and not have done all i could do with a catastrophe on top of us um well all you could might have included already having ordered a mandatory evacuation by now instead of waiting until 24 hours before the hurricane hits it also might have included calling the hurricane center on your own initiative argh i am not remotely impressed with mayor nagin at the moment this one is different 8272005 100800 pm est posted by brendan loy axodys has a good roundup of new orleans bloggers posts my favorite is this dear evacuation monkeys this one is different you officially have my permission to freak out heh indeed hurricane warnings up barometric pressure down 8272005 095200 pm est posted by brendan loy hurricane katrinas minimum central pressure is down to 939 mb thats the lowest its been yet and it corresponds to category 4 strength but it may take the winds a few hours to catch up with the pressure especially given katrinas newfound huge geographic size officially the winds are still at lowend category 3 strength or 115 mph i think that will change by the 400 am advisory and certainly by the 1000 am advisory i expect katrina will be a category 4 hurricane 131 mph i wouldnt be at all surprised if shes a highend category 4 or even a category 5 by afternoon or evening all the conditions for rapid intensification are there now its just a matter of watching and waiting to see if it happens or perhaps more precisely how bad it is meanwhile most of the hurricane watches have been upgraded to hurricane warnings the blueandpink zones on the far east and far west are hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings the red area is under a hurricane warning how to not get caught on the highway during a major hurricane 101 8272005 092500 pm est posted by brendan loy traffic isnt terribly bad on the roads leading out of new orleans right now according to jeff morrow on the weather channel specifically he says the road to baton rouge is pretty clear so now is still a good time to evacuate when the idiot mayor finally announces the mandatory evacuation order tomorrow morning that will change dr jeff masters 20 chance of new orleans calamity 8272005 085900 pm est posted by brendan loy the weatherbloggers are kicking into high gear dr jeff masters has another excellent post we may be on the verge of a rapid deepening phase since the shear and dry air on the northwest side of the hurricane appear to be lessening and the hurricane is moving over a deep layer of warm water of almost 90f the areal size of the hurricane continues to expand and katrina is growing from a medium sized hurricane to a large hurricane where the pressure will bottom out after this deepening phase is anyones guess and i believe something in the 915 925 mb range is most likely hurricane andrew was 922 mb at landfall camille was 909 mb ed which would make katrina a strong category 4 or weak category 5 hurricane by tomorrow afternoon the deepening phase may last longer than usual for a major hurricane since katrina is expanding in size and thus has more mass to spin up after this phase of rapid deepening another eyewall replacement cycle will occur and the timing of that cycle will be worth billions of dollars and perhaps many lives there is no way to predict when this eyewall replacement cycle will occur another major factor will be the timing of the tidesif katrina hits at high tide there will be billions more in damage there is still the possibility too that the trough that is now steering katrina to the north will also create enough shear to reduce her to a category 3 storm at landfall this is what happened to hurricane ivan last year new orleans finally got serious and ordered an evacuation but far too late actually they didnt even order it they merely suggested it ed there is no way everyone will be able to get out of the city in time and they may be forced to take shelter in the superdome which is above sea level if katrina makes a direct hit on new orleans as a category 4 hurricane the levees protecting the city will be breached and new orleans which is 6 10 feet below sea level will fill with water on top of this 6 feet of water will come a 15 foot storm surge and on top of that will be 20 foot waves so the potential for high loss of life is great given the current track and intensity forecast id put the odds of this at about 20 katrina could cost 100 billion spike oil prices to 75barrel 8272005 085700 pm est posted by brendan loy on top of everything else hurricane katrina could be economically devastating costing the insurance industry countless billions and sending gas prices even higher than they already are lets start with the latter issue steve gregory writes hurricane katrina is heading for prime oil producing real estate in the north central gulf unless the forecasts prove very wrong as in landfall 250 miles to the east or the storm is much weaker oil prices will jump tremendously on monday last year ivan took out fully 6 of the entire us annual production of oil and a fair amount of this years record high prices has to do with the threat of another ivan on friday the market thought katrina would be a cat 2 in the florida panhandle and priced oil accordingly if katrina stays on course prices will jump 35 per barrel monday morning further increases to 75bbl may follow tuesday if there are reports of serious infrastructure damage on par with that done last year by ivan by far the most expensive hurricane to affect the us oil producing industry as far as the potential for direct costs from hurricane damage dr jeff masters says katrina could be the costliest hurricane ever if she hits new orleans as a category 4 hurricane insurers estimate that katrina already did about 1 to 4 billion in damage total damage is roughly double insured damage this is a shocking number for a category 1 hurricane and bodes ill for the residents of new orleans and the us insurance industry if katrina makes a direct hit on new orleans as a category 4 storm which would likely cost 100 billion but new orleans amazing run of luck could well continue at the expense of mississippi or alabama or florida like camille in 1969 katrina may come ashore far enough east of new orleans to largely spare it only time and eyewall replacement cycles will tell another camille 8272005 081500 pm est posted by brendan loy because no one else seems willing to say this im going to keep screaming it until my face turns blue katrina could be another camille metereology student charles fenwick of eye of the storm explains why if you were writing a book on hurricanes and wanted to get examples of the factors needed to create a category five hurricane you would not have to search hard for all exist right now low shear doesnt get lower than this parts of katrina are in areas of sub5 knot shear high amounts of heat potential red freaking hot right in the middle of katrinas path a wellorganized already powerful hurricane here you go can i guarantee a category five no is katrina going to try her damndest to make it yes the only things limiting her are space time and the sole weakness of a powerful hurricane an unpredictable eyewall replacement cycle that temporarily reduces its strength one eyewall replacement cycle is ending now katrina has probably a solid day of intensification ahead i expect to see some amazing pressure drops overnight tonight andor tomorrow a welltimed second eyewall replacement cycle occuring shortly before landfall but not too long before because then it will have time to restrengthen now appears to be the only thing that can the gulf coast from a calamity significantly worse than any of the recent hurricanes that have struck there and there is no guarantee that such a lucky event will occur if you think you can ride out katrina because you survived ivan and dennis youre wrong you need leave and you need to do it now before its too late as fenwick writes if you are living on the coast or an otherwise lowlying area inside the danger cone portrayed in the national hurricane center forecast and you do not have plans to leave then you are putting your life in grave danger there is still time to secure life and property but it is quickly running out for the residents of the northern gulf coast now is the time to take decisive action to do both steve gregory also has an excellent post about eyewall replacement cycles and whats going on with katrina katrina strengthening again 8272005 075600 pm est posted by brendan loy the barometric pressure is dropping again 1000 am 940 mb 100 pm 949 mb weakening because of eyewall replacement cycle 400 pm 945 mb 700 pm 944 mb latest recon data 941 mb the wind speeds often take a number of hours to catch up with the pressure katrina never reached its full potential as a 940 mb hurricane prior to the eyewall replacement cycle which i think is why the winds never dropped below 115 mph even as the pressure rose so now that the pressure is back down in the 940 mb range i expect it wont be long before the winds start ramping up tell it like it is jim 8272005 075400 pm est posted by brendan loy watching the weather channel jeff morrow is in new orleans stephanie abrams is in gulf shores alabama jim cantore is in biloxi mississippi trying to position himself to be in the heart of the rightfront quadrant or as he calls it home cantore seems to be the only person on the the weather channel who is willing to utter the dread words category five good for him people along the coast need to realize exactly what theyre dealing with here there is a substantial chance that this could be not just another ivan not just another betsy but another camille will hearing that scare people yes and thats good the important thing here is not to prevent panic its to cause just enough panic to convince people to leave the mayor of new orleans is an idiot 8272005 073400 pm est posted by brendan loy i cant emphasize enough what a bad decision i think it is for new orleans mayor ray nagin to delay the mandatory evacuation order until tomorrow morning according to the weather channel lots of tourists in the french quarter are happy the evacuation is only voluntary and are planning to stay in town until it becomes mandatory idiots those people may find themselves stuck on a highway with 180 mph wind gusts howling around them of course if that happens they wont actually be stuck for long nor will they be on the highway landfall is expected to occur around midday monday so by waiting until tomorrow morning mayor nagin will be giving people scarcely 24 hours to get out perhaps hes hoping to ease the evacuation traffic jams by starting things off with a trickle but thats awfully risky will ray nagin go down in history as the mayor who fiddled while new orleans drowned could be watches extended east track inches west warnings tonight 8272005 065300 pm est posted by brendan loy sorry for the lack of updates i had a headache earlier and needed to rest that turned into a threehour nap luckily or unluckily for new orleanians not much changed while i was asleep katrina is still at 115 mph shes still in a concentric eyewall cycle but seems to certain to strengthen once its over and the forecast track still looks like a worstcase potential doomsday scenario for new orleans katrinas sustained winds are still expected to reach 145 mph at landfall with gusts to 180 mph and it is still possibile that shell get even stronger than that becoming just the fourth category five hurricane in recorded history to make landfall on the united states mainland hurricane watches as expected have been extended eastward to the alabamaflorida border but that doesnt indicate an rightward lurch in the track the nhc simply put the louisiana warnings up a few hours early to give new orleans and vicinity more time to prepare the track has actually edged eversoslightly to the left but the belowsealevel city of new orleans is still directly in the crosshairs for some reason that i cant even begin to comprehend the evacuation order for new orleans is only voluntary at this time the mayor says he might issue mandatory evacuations tomorrow morning depending on what the forecast says what is he waiting for the forecast calls for a direct hit this is the story weve been fearing for decades and if he waits until 24 hours before landfall to order people to leave it may very well be too late people getting stuck on the highways while a category five hurricane makes landfall is one of the most horrifying scenarios imaginable memo to new orleanians who are thinking about riding it out 8272005 034600 pm est posted by brendan loy dr jeff masters puts the odds of a catastrophic filling the bowl scenario ie the destruction of new orleans at approximately 10 percent so heres the question you should be asking yourself if you live in the big easy or anywhere inside the bowl and are hesitant to evacuate if you knew there was a 10 percent chance terrorists were going to set off a nuclear bomb in your city on monday would you stick around or would you evacuate thats essentially equivalent to what youre dealing with here i sure as hell would leave tulane vs usm 8272005 031100 pm est posted by brendan loy college football resource points out that the tulane and southern miss football teams are scheduled to play each other next sunday sept 4 on southern misss campus in hattiesburg ms whether that game actually occurs will depend on several things including how badly hattiesburg 75 miles inland is hit by katrina and perhaps more importantly whether there is still a tulane university come next sunday traffic moving north of no 8272005 025000 pm est posted by brendan loy i just talked to tom grace the blog reader who emailed me last night saying he and his family would be leaving new orleans this morning they are indeed on the road halfway to jackson ms their destination is memphis he said theres moderate traffic moving at 65 mph hes going to call back later when hes off the road so i can give him the necessary information so he can file audioblog reports heres what he emailed me a few hours ago before leaving we have the house almost buttoned up and the car half packed we will be leaving new orleans within a couple of hours have to pick up my 87 yo mom then head north across lake pontchartrain where we will meet up with my wifes family before taking i12 to memphis at the moment we are planning to take both cars though we may leave one of them on the north shore in covington la which might be a safe place for it i just want to leave early before the lemmings as i call them most people will decide to leave about the same time then it could take 10 hours to get 30 miles as it did for my son and his family last year when they waited just a few hours to evacuate for hurricane ivan anyone else in katrinas path or in the process of evacuating from it please feel free to email me if youd like to file some firsthand reports either by audio or if

campus as soon as possible if you can leave with your parents today do so if you have friends or relatives with whom you can seek shelter do so now students who are unable to leave new orleans should contact their resident assistant immediately for university assistance no students will be allowed to occupy residence halls after 6 pm today katrina a critical moment 8272005 022000 pm est posted by brendan loy were at a critical moment in hurricane katrinas development right now the next few hours are probably the last best chance for a serious disruption that could ultimately prevent katrina from making landfall as a monster hurricane weatherblogger steve gregory explains katrina is currently in a presumably temporary weakening cycle due to an eye wall replacement that began 5 hours ago in all likelihood katrinas max winds at the surface are now of only cat 2 intensity katrina will complete the eye wall replacement cycle and the eye will again begin to shrink down by this evening note katrinas eye wall cycling that has resulted in a 50nm wide eye leaves katrina in a vulnerable state and dry air intrusion could take place during the next 6 hours which will trash the intensity forecast until this evening we really wont know for sure there will be a period of time on sunday when the shears will approach zero and the outflow to the nnw of the storm will be enhanced by the high level southwesterly winds ahead of the developing trof this 1218 hour period of perfect environmental conditions and winds including even warmer waters associated with the loop current and the semipermanent pool of warm water in the gulf south of louisiana will provide ideal conditions and the opportunity for katrina to rapidly intensify and the ability to attain strong cat 4 if not cat 5 intensity assuming she manages to reintensify this evening so what happens in the next six hours or so is absolutely critical hopefully some dry air will get in there and mess things up katrina a cat 3 expected to be 145 mph at landfall 8272005 125800 pm est posted by brendan loy katrina officially became a major hurricane overnight with 115 mph winds and her expected intensity at landfall was upped to 145 mph moreover according to the 1000 am discussion it is not out of the question that katrina could reach category 5 status at some point before landfall also at 1000 am the nhc issued a hurricane watch for southeastern louisiana including new orleans and lake ponchartrain this is not a test said new orleans mayor ray nagin evacuation orders for the city will be issued very soon already nearby placquemines and st bernard parishes have urged people to leave according to the states plan new orleans and orleans parish call for evacuations after the lowlying areas to allow people who live south and east of the city to get on the road first and head for safety mayor nagin urged new orleanians to get their supplies get their medications in order clean up storm drains and get ready because it looks as if were going to get hit the hurricane center will likely expand the hurricane watches eastward to cover the mississippi and perhaps alabama coastlines as well later today it sounds like they did follow my advice and fudge the normal timetable a bit for new orleans where hurricane preparedness is a uniquely difficult prospect it bears repeating just what were dealing with here the potential destruction of a city and the deaths of many thousands who are unable or unwilling to evacuate dr jeff masters puts the odds of this scenario at one in ten id hate to be an emergency management official in new orleans right now katrina is pretty much following the nhc forecast and appears likely to pass very close to new orleans im surprised they havent ordered an evacuation of the city yet while the odds of a catastropic hit that would completely flood the city of new orleans are probably 10 that is way too high in my opinion to justify leaving the people in the city if i lived in the city i would evactuate now there is a very good reason that the coroners office in new orleans keeps 10000 body bags on hand the risks are too great from this storm and a weekend away from the city would be nice anyway right go new orleans needs a full 72 hours to evacuate and landfall is already less than 72 hours away get out now and beat the rush youre not going to have to go to work or school on monday anyway if an evacuation is ordered not everyone who wants to get out may be able to do soparticularly the 60000 poor people with no cars and it only gets worse in addition to increasing in strength katrina has also substantially increased in size as you can see for yourself here hurricaneforce winds now extend outward up to 40 miles and tropicalstormforce winds up to 150 miles from the center thats up from 25 and 85 miles respectively just 12 hours ago katrina will deliver a widespread damaging blow wherever she comes ashore says dr masters okay now for the good news such as it is katrina hasnt strengthened since she reached 115 mph about eight hours ago shes been going through an eyewall replacement cycle and its possible she might weaken a bit this afternoon though im not sure if thats good or bad news as it might cause people to become dangerously complacent only to have katrina blow up into a monster tomorrow also according to the discussion there is a possibility that southerly or southwesterly shear could affect katrina starting at 48 hrand as always happens in hurricane of this intensity additional concentric eyewall cycles could occur that would be good although 48 hours from now shell already have come ashore wont she hmm hurry up shear those two things wind shear and eyewall replacement cycles are the only factors that might prevent katrina from being another charley or worse another camille at landfall water temperatures arent going to do the trick as they did with opal and dennis the seasurface temperatures near the shoreline have warmed since july theres a patch of water due south of new orleans that is extremely warm and deep that could easily be the engine that boosts katrina to cat 5 during the final hours before landfall which of course would be very very very bad 110 mph 8272005 022800 am est posted by brendan loy hurricane katrina now has maximum sustained winds of 110 mph putting her on the threshold of category 3 im going to bed now by the time i wake up i expect her to be a major hurricane the big one 8272005 010000 am est posted by brendan loy heres an excellent essay written in 2002 about the mortal threat that new orleans faces if you live in new orleans here is the official evacuation info from the louisiana state police that youll probably be needing tomorrow if theres a storm surge into lake pontchartrain this stormsurge gauge located here will see it as will these waterlevel monitors 1 2 3 more data here and here finally here are some traffic cams from the new orleans area could get interesting tomorrow update i just got an email report from tom grace a resident of metairie la just west of new orleans he writes i just got back from tieing up my boat putting out extra lines and fenders and generally preparing her as best i could for katrina in case she comes here we are in the process of putting things together to load into the car so we can leave in the morning we have reservations in memphis the closest place we could find a petfriendly hotel wish us luck we will need it our press reports that because of the gradual destruction of the barrier islands which used to provide protection for us our city now faces extreme danger from even a category 2 storm in the past it was believed that we faced that danger only from a category 3 or stronger storm see for example here and here more later if we get a chance good luck tom and family and thanks for the email hurricane guestbloggers wanted 8272005 122700 am est posted by brendan loy anyone in hurricane katrinas path whether staying behind or preparing to evacuate if you would be interested in guestblogging here please email me i can make it possible for you to guestblog via cell phone if you are evacuating whatever the situation id love to have some firsthand reports evacuate 8262005 112200 pm est posted by brendan loy im not a meteorologist im just an amateur weather enthusiast a lawstudent blogger who happens to be a hurricane buff but if i lived in new orleans i would definitely leave at this point tonight barring a major change in the forecast i expect the evacuation orders to come tomorrow that will produce massive traffic jams and general confusion my advice beat the rush get out now for it is imperative to get out katrina probably wont destroy new orleans but it could so if anyone in new orleans is reading this id personally advise you to get the hell out of dodge models cluster on nearworstcase track 8262005 095600 pm est posted by brendan loy the 1000 pm discussion of hurricane katrina is pretty much all bad news lets start with the new forecast track which has once against shifted to the left and is now very very close to being the doomsday scenario for new orleans heres a closer view this is pretty much the very track that disaster planners have feared for years the one that features a major hurricane moving in from due south of the city with the eye passing next to new orleans but just to the east thus literally blowing the overflowing lake pontchartrain into the city turning the big easy into a modernday atlantis heres what it might look like here are some maps heres my entirely unofficial rendering of a closeup of the nhcs track using google maps and based on the forecast latitude and longitude points for 48 and 72 hours and a conservative estimate of recurvature compare and contrast with camille and betsy both of which were further from new orleans than this would be this is not good people and it gets worse it is worth noting that the guidance spread has decreased and most of the reliable numerical model tracks are now clustered between the eastern coast of louisiana and the coast of mississippi this clustering increases the confidence in the forecast great a highconfidence forecast for a track that could kill 100000 people and utterly destroy a major american city oh and another bad thing after leveling off this afternoon and evening katrina is strengthening again shes up to 105 mph now the official forecast brings her to 130 mph at landfall with 160 mph gusts one computer model thinks shell have sustained winds of 140 mph another says 150 mph barring some unexpected intervening force this thing is going to be a monster the water out there is very warm and very deep and the atmosphere is very conducive to strengthening theres nothing standing in katrinas way except well the gulf coast i expect hurricane watches and massive evacuations tomorrow if i can glean any good news out of this discussion it might be this katrina continues to move stubbornly toward the westsouthwest or 250 degrees at 7 knots along the eastern side of a very strong deeplayer mean high centered over texas i like that word stubbornly because when hurricanes are moving stubbornly it often means the forecasts will continue to be wrong because the computer models really are not understanding the dynamics of whats going on in this case that might mean katrina will continue to move further west than expected and perhaps new orleans will be spared as landfall occurs west of the city in the central parishes this is actually my personal forecast but bear in mind im not a meterologist i just play one on the internet bottom line new orleans is in serious trouble if katrina follows the nhcs projected path caveat hurricane forecasting is an inexact science 72hour predictions have a substantial margin of error the entire northern gulf coast should be keeping a very close eye on katrina i am focusing on new orleans because a direct hit there would be catastrophic in a way that no other scenario would be not because other areas are safe if you live anywhere from western louisiana to the central florida panhandle you should be watching katrina closely ps charles fenwick writes residents of coastal southeast louisana mississippi and western alabama need to start taking action tomorrow morning to prepare for the arrival of what will be a dangerous hurricane due to the warming of the gulf of mexico that has taken place throughout the summer there is far more fuel for the hurricane as it approaches the coast dennis ran out of gas as it were during his last hours over the water this is much less likely to be the case for katrina as deep warm waters extend almost all the way to land state of emergency in louisiana 8262005 094400 pm est posted by brendan loy the governor of louisiana has declared a state of emergency good residents of new orleans and the surrounding areas need to realize now just how serious the threat from hurricane katrina really is much of the media seems convinced that this is still exclusively a florida issue which is just not true drudges headline is katrina could be cat 4 at second fla strike which is ridiculous considering the current expected landfall is along the alabamamississippi border and thats on the eastern edge of the computermodel guidance thats not to say a florida landfall isnt still possible it certainly is but people need to be making preparations right now all along the northern gulf coast especially new orleans update welcome instapundit readers scroll down for my complete coverage of katrina also click here to read about what the hurricane could do to new orleans if shes strong enough and makes a direct hit on the city bottom line tens of thousands could die heres a look at the computermodel guidance right now remember the worstcase scenario is a hurricane moving in from due south of the city and thats what the computer models are forecasting right now check out the gfs my wild guess katrina will spare new orleans making landfall west of the city over the central parishes a la andrew honoring the troops 8262005 075700 pm est posted by brendan loy this is a nice story hat tip david humbled by katrina 8262005 055400 pm est posted by brendan loy the 400 pm forecast track has hurricane katrina aiming for mobile bay which would be apocalypse lite really bad but an order of magnitude less bad than a direct hit on new orleans however the mobile scenario is on the east end of the guidance envelope according to the discussion we could easily see some further westward drift in the nhcs predicted track at 1000 pm and 400 am bottom line the forecast is very much in flux and its far too early to know where this thing is headed if you stop and think about it for a moment theres something incredibly humbling about the situation were in right now watching and waiting to see where katrina goes a week from now the city of new orleans a great industrialized city in the most powerful nation in the history of the world might be annihilated or it might be devastated but not destroyed or it might be mildly damaged or it might be perfectly fine we have absolutely no control over and a very limited ability to predict which of these scenarios will occur we are utterly at natures mercy which scenario occurs annihiliation devastation mild damage or no damage at all will be determined when you boil it down to the bare essentials by the movements of countless air and water vapor molecules through the atmosphere over the gulf of mexico and elsewhere the vagaries of atmospheric dynamics will determine the fates of thousands of human beings a miniscule variation in the upperlevel pressure gradient right now could alter katrinas track enough that 72 hours from now it ends up 100 miles east or west of where it otherwise would have been that is more than enough to differentiate life from death city from no city indeed as charles fenwick points out even 30 miles here or there can separate a close call from a direct hit the difference between absolute disaster major damageor annoyance is within the margin of forecast error at 12 hours right down to the bitter end the air molecules control our fate if katrina gets close enough a lastminute wobble could save or doom the big easy if youre a religious person i guess those atmospheric dynamics might seem a bit less random but then devastating natural disasters have happened before and theyll happen again so im not sure how comforting the idea of the guiding hand of god is in this situation i tend to say things like pray that new orleans is spared because im really not sure what else to say or do prayer is the only thing that even has the potential to work anyway supposing there is a god or some sort of higher power which i firmly believe and supposing he makes a habit of intervening in our everyday lives of which i am far less certain the fact remains that his decisions are just as inscrutable as the molecules random movements and thus its just as humbling regardless of whose mercy were at natures or gods either way we do not control our own destinies nearly to the extent that we like to believe that might sound a bit depressing but like casey i find it aweinspiring in a way he said it in the context of the forces that shaped the earth billions of years ago but it applies here too i find our fragility both beautiful and humbling daunting and inspiring were here because this indifferent world of ours somehow worked out just right but were simultaneously subordinate to these cycles of destruction and when lucky creation that are much larger than any one species new orleans in peril 8262005 015700 pm est posted by brendan loy at the risk of being alarmist we could be 34 days away from an unprecedented cataclysm that could kill as many as 100000 people in new orleans such a scenario is unlikely the conditions would have be just right or rather just wrong but imho its not nearly unlikely enough to feel good about things if i were in new orleans i would seriously consider getting the hell out of dodge right now just in case once the evacuation orders are issued if it comes to that itll inevitably be an absolute madhouse despite officials best efforts more here some computer models are taking katrina on a worstcase scenario track almost due north over the marshlands and straight into the belowsealevel city or just to its west if the hurricane is strong enough and category 4 is looking more and more likely that could very possibly flood the bowl breaching the lake pontchartrain levees and turning the city and the east bank of jefferson parish into a lake as much as 30 feet deep fouled with chemicals and waste from ruined septic systems businesses and homes trapping hundreds of thousands of people in buildings and in vehicles while high winds and tornadoestear at everything left standing source and even if evacuation orders are issued lots of people wont leave hence the prediction of between 25000 and 100000 deaths in a worstcase direct hit i and everyone else had the same fear when ivan was approaching last september that storm ultimately took a righthand turn and hit near the floridaalabama border georges in 1998 was also a close call but it too veered right at the last minute will katrina do the same maybe but increasingly the computer models are suggesting not note the distinct westward shift in the gfs models predicted landfall point between last night and this morning and the gfs is not alone according to charles fenwick at eye of the storm every global model plus the gfdl shifted its track to the west its forecast to the west in its 12z run forecasts are now in a fairly tight cluster between eastern louisana and mississippi while it is generally unwise to hop onto one run of the models as the gospel it is meaningful when every model makes the same type of shift this definitely shifts the area of concern much further west than i had been figuring caveat hurricane forecasting is an extremely inexact science especially when were talking about what will happen in 72 hours hence my statement that the new orleans scenario is unlikely it would be statistically unlikely even if the big easy were directly in the center of the nhcs forecast track because these things can and usually do change thats why the highest coastal strike probability percentages at this point are under 20 katrina is going to hit somewhere along the gulf coast but the actual odds of her taking any particular track even the most likely one are still quite low because there are just so many possibilities but despite that fact if new orleans is anywhere near the center of the risk area residents need to prepare as if there is a 100 chance of a direct hit because the 90 chance it wont happen isnt going save their lives if the 10 chance it will happens to come true anyway it will be very interesting to see what the national hurricane centers discussion at 400 pm est says presumably this new computermodel guidance will cause them to shift the official forecast track substantially to the west but how far west and how long will they wait before issuing watches and warnings normally watches go up approximately 48 hours before the leading edge of the storm is expected to hit but i wonder whether the nhc might fudge that a bit and issue watches earlier if new orleans looks like the target in light of the timeconsuming logistical nightmare that a citywide evacuation would be on the other hand an evacuation that ultimately proves to have been unnecessary is economically costly and more importantly may have a vigilancelowering boy who cried wolf effect especially since it would be the second time in as many years so this is going to be a tough call for the nhc heres hoping they get it right and heres praying that new orleans is spared katrina intensifying rapidly cat 4 by monday 8262005 110600 am est posted by brendan loy the national hurricane center issued a special advisory a halfhour ago indicating that hurricane katrina has rapidly strengthened into a category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph and further intensification seems inevitable given the rapid improvement in the inner core structure and the sharp pressure droprapid intensification seems likely for the next 12 hours or so afterwardssteady intensification to near category four strength by 72 hours appears to be in order given the very warm gulf waters beneath the hurricane and the vertical shear forecast to decrease to less than 10 kt by 48 hours so where will this soontobeamonster hurricane go the computer models are all over the map more here according to the 1000 am discussion the nogaps and gfdn models have made a large jump to the west over louisianawhereas the majority of the nhc models take katrina inland over the northeast gulf coast ie alabama or the florida panhandle the official forecast track remains in the right portion of the model guidance envelope my new orleans nervousness increases a picture share

well that didnt take long 8262005 074900 am est posted by brendan loy as of 400 am est katrina is a hurricane again she was a tropical storm for exactly four hours heres the latest forecast track its shifted slightly to the left but the florida panhandle is still seen as the likely target most of the computer models agree though the exact location is up in the air which is not surprising for a landfall thats 3 to 4 days away the intensity forecast conservatively brings katrina to 105 mph at landfall but the discussion says it is certainly possible that katrina could attain major hurricane status ie 111 mph before making landfall somewhere on the northern gulf coast katrina turns south stays strong 8252005 110900 pm est posted by brendan loy hurricane katrina has turned southwestward and sped up a bit so she will emerge over the gulf of mexico in just a few hours radar loop here thats good for south florida which will get less rain than expected but bad for wherever this hurricane heads next katrina hasnt weakened much at all during her brief sojourn over the florida peninsula even now as the center nears the states west coast shes still at 75 mph the nhcs forecast that katrina would only attain minimal category 2 strength over the gulf was based on the premise that she would weaken to 50 mph first so her failure to significantly weaken is distinctly bad news and should substantially change the intensity forecast with steady intensification expected once the center reemerges over water i suspect katrina will be at least category 3 at second landfall update charles fenwick at eye of the storm writes more than four hours over land and still a hurricane remarkable now its more than five hours but fenwick offers a good explanation for why katrinas southerly course is taking her over the everglades the difference between the everglades and open water is slight regarding the track steve gregory says there is is still way too much uncertainty with the exact timing of the turn northward and the entire gulf coast from louisiana eastward to tampa could ultimately be at risk for the next and final landfall of katrina dr jeff masters says an area from new orleans to cedar key florida at risk in the center of this risk area lies the uss very own hurricane magnet the pensacola region where ivan and dennis struck i can certainly understand pensacolans being nervous what makes me nervous is that katrinas southwestward turn and refusal to weaken makes a new orleans doomsday scenario considerably more plausible than it seemed just a few hours ago still unlikely but more likely than it was update 1217 am katrina has finally weakened to a tropical storm as of midnight est approximately six hours after making landfall but that wont last long shes already got her

by brendan loy one of the cases in our initial assignment for professor garnetts freedom of speech class brown v california department of transportation was particularly interesting for me because i was living in california when the case was decided and i wrote an oped column about it more than two years before starting law school in which i disagreed with the district courts ruling which was later affirmed by the ninth circuit in the case that we read naturally i just had to dig up my old article to see what i had written here it is it was published in the usc daily trojan on february 13 2002 the case revolves around two peace activists who sued the state department of transportation aka caltrans and won after their peaceprotest signs were taken down from a stateowned freeway overpass while american flags were allowed to remain up on that same overpass and other overpasses across the state this was during the initial months after 911 when as youll recall american flags were spontaneously showing up everywhere it was also during the afghanistan phase of the war on terror caltrans claimed it was implementing a viewpointneutral safety policy the court disagreed alas part of my dt article appears to have been based on a faulty premise i thought caltranss policy banned signs but allowed all flags not just the american flag according to the case that we read earlier this week thats not true only american flags were allowed thats what i get for trusting the la times instead of reading the case myself so that invalidates some portions of my argument eg stating that the activists could have put up a peace flag instead of a sign reading at what cost but the latter and more important part of my argument still holds water excerpt lest we forget we all live in the united states of america of which the stars and stipes are the universal national symbol waving the flag is not necessarily an endorsement of any particular president policy or military action the flag is the symbol of our republic its constitution and its ideals including the right of the people to oppose their governments policies neither the bush administration nor the antiwar movement owns the american flag and the flag is not on its face an endorsement of either certainly many who favor the war on terrorism use the flag as their symbol but there is no reason why those who oppose the war could not also wave the flag and with just as much justification they are just as patriotic just as american as the wars proponents they are following the constitution by exercising free speech and petitioning the government for a redress of grievances but many refuse to accept the flag for what it is instead of claiming it as their ownwhich it isthey read into it everything that they disagree with and conclude that all flagwavers are robotic bush cronies every american flag becomes the enemy judge whyte apparently bought into this logic as well the premise that underlies his ruling depends on it after all if the flag is accepted as a universal symbol of american ideals and the american constitution then it is in total harmony with the at what cost banner but if it is regarded as a symbol of support for the war then it is a viewpoint in opposition to the banner and both must be treated equally the american flag should not be considered equal to other banners and signs whether those banners and signs support or oppose the present government a support our troops sign and an at what cost sign must have the same constitutional standing but a flag is something else entirely it is intrinsically neutral in a political debate the only thing it stands for is the ability of both sides to engage in the debate im not certain if i would make the same argument today as relates to the courts decision i do personally believe strongly that the flag should be a neutral symbol in debates over specific government policies but that doesnt necessarily mean that in the real world it is or that it is perceived as such by the majority of the public so perhaps judge whyte and later the ninth circuit was indeed correct to rule that the governments action was not viewpointneutral in this context on the other hand i must admit the 2005 lawstudent brendan still finds the 2002 editorialcolumnist brendans argument relatively compelling if i do say so myself either way its interesting for me at least to read what i had to say about this case back when i was a mere news junkie and journalistintraining and not yet a law junkie and lawyerintraining read the whole thing computer models still confused about katrina 8252005 122800 am est posted by brendan loy the 1100 pm discussion on tropical storm katrina notes this forecast is rather difficult since one of the more reliable modelsthe gfsshows that the cyclone barely touches the east coast of florida before moving northwardwhile the outstanding gfdl moves katrina south of due west across extreme south florida and the keys as a very intense hurricane the gfdl scenario would be very dangerous for south florida this appears to be unrealistic at this time but because of the good past performance of this modelwe must pay close attention to future model runs the gfdl track is the green line on this map heres the official track back into the law school groove 8242005 104400 pm est posted by brendan loy alex explains why

could be a major hurricane at landfall 8242005 064000 pm est posted by brendan loy russell may have been on to something when he wrote yesterday that tropical storm katrina then just a nascent tropical depression could become a monster hurricane before landfall the official forecast calls for katrina to hit south florida as a category 1 hurricane with 80 mph winds on friday but the latest nhc discussion raises the possibility that she may reach major hurricane status with the improved banding featuressymmetrical upperlevel outflowand relatively weak shearat least steady intensification of a normal rate of 10 kt per 12 hours until landfall occurs seems justified this is similar to the ships intensity modelbut much less than the now very bullish gfdl model which brings katrina to 111 kt 130 mph borderline category 34 just before landfall it should be pointed out that with ssts near 31c and a low shear environment conditions are favorable for possible rapid intensification to occur between now and landfall this is suggested by the ships model experimental rapid intensification outputwhich indicates a 57 percent probability of that occurring the only inhibiting factor is the dry air that surrounds katrina and has been working its way into the innercore region and eroding the deep convection if the dry air mixes out within the next 12 hoursthen intensities would likely be higher than the official forecast is indicating theres also the matter of reemergence over the gulf of mexico charles fenwick at eye of the storm writes it is a bit soon to rate the probabilities of the scenarios however it is worthwhile for residents of the gulf coast from mobile alabama to st marks florida to be aware of the possibility of a significant hurricane affecting their area in six days fenwick also notes that thanks to katrina the 2005 atlantic hurricane season has now given rise to the earliest recorded formation dates for the fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth tenth and eleventh named tropical storms of the season thats eight consecutive earliest ever records details here however the twelfthstorm record is august 28 and nothing else looks too likely to develop at the

south florida will certainly want to keep a close eye on this because if it were to become become organized it could intensify fairly quickly but not so much that it would be a dire threat fellow

existing cyclonethe old namenumber is retained tropical depression twelve has a complex genesis that likely includes a midlevel remnant of former tropical depression ten a review of satellite and rawinsonde data over the past week or so suggests that a second disturbance approached and combined with the midlevel remnant of tropical depression ten on 20 august because it is impossible to determine which of these two systems is associated with todays genesiswe have elected to use the designation twelve rather than ten for the new depression this situation differs from last years

hold few things sacred and will make fun of almost anything in keeping with that spirit i made a joke in a post below about smith college which evidently upset some people i wont repeat it but suffice it to say the comment was intended entirely in good fun ive had a couple of friendsrelatives straight and gay alike who went to smith and made similar jokes and thats where i pick it up from i dont think theres anything inherently wrong with making such a joke so long as its made in the right spirit but its all a matter of context and i understand the concerns that are being raised along those lines in light of the sometimes tense nature of the gayrights debate as notre dame perhaps its unwise to repeat such jokes on a blog thats widely read here especially during the first week of school as some people on either or both sides of the debate may not understand that i really and truly am just kidding even with a smiley face next to the comment so i removed it i apologize to those who were offended the fallacy of moral authority 8232005 101000 am est posted by brendan loy liberal columnist jonathan chait takes issue and rightfully so with the idea that cindy sheehans views their correctness and their importance should be judged on the basis of her personal tragedy everybody of course ought to feel horrible for sheehan and to honor her sons bravery but sheehans supporters dont just want us to sympathize with her they believe that her loss gives her views on the iraq war more sway than the views of the rest of us as maureen dowd wrote in the new york times the moral authority of parents who bury children killed in iraq is absolute one of the important ideas of a democratic culture is that we all have equal standing in the public square that doesnt mean stupid ideas should be taken as seriously as smart ones it means that the content of an argument should be judged on its own merits the left seems to be embracing the notion of moral authority in part as a tactical response to the right for years conservatives have said or implied that if you criticize a war you hate the soldiers during the clinton years conservatives insisted that the president lacked moral authority to send troops into battle because he had avoided the draft as a youth or later because he lied about his affair with monica lewinsky so adopting veterans or their mourning parents as spokesmen is an understandable countertactic it was a major part of the rationale behind john kerrys candidacy the trouble is plenty of liberals have come to believe their own bleatings about moral authority liberal blogs are filled with attacks on chicken hawk conservatives who support the war but never served in the military a recent story in the antiwar magazine nation attacked my new republic editor peter beinart a supporter of the iraq war for having no national security experience as if nation editors routinely served in the marine corps the silliness of this argument is obvious there are parents of dead soldiers on both sides conservatives have begun trotting out their own this week what does this tell us about the virtues or flaws of the war nothing can i get an amen read

mohammad atta before 911 but a second officer has come forward to publicly claim that indeed it did atta was identified by able danger by januaryfebruary of 2000 says navy captain scott j phillpott however pentagon spokesman lawrence di rita said that while colonel shaffer and captain phillpott were respected military officers whose accounts were taken seriously thus far weve not been able to uncover what these people said they saw memory is a complicated thing hmm this discrepancy is the exactly sort of thing youd think the 911 commission would have wanted to investigate no meanwhile mickey kaus continues to advance the multiple attas theory the presence of two mohamed attas in praguethe 911 hijacker and a pakistani businessman with the same namewithin days of each other mayjune 2000 helped confuse investigators after 911 but that means of course that there were not two attas but three attas potentially on abledangeresque datamining radar screens prior to 911 1 the future 911 hijacker 2 the abu nidal terrorist extradited to israel 3 the pakistani businessman who flew to prague from saudi arabia but the three attas defense while interesting is emphatically not what the

out actually i dont think either side of the debate is going to be terribly happy about this to the gayrights crowd being 2 on such a list is still not exactly something to celebrate while to the maintain our catholic identity crowd getting demoted in this manner could be seen as yet another sign albeit small of georgetownesque slippage but dont worry fellas its all monks fault im sure father jenkins will get us back to 1 in no time other lists where notre dame appears 1 everyone plays intramural sports 2 students pack the stadiums behind maryland 4 students pray on a regular basis behind byu wheaton and grove city college 6 jock schools 8 future rotarians and daughters of the american revolution 12 dont inhale ie not much marijuana use 12 best campus food 12 more to do on campus than offcampus 20 school runs like butter ps the best party school is the university of wisconsin with ohio university lehigh and ucsb close behind and here i thought jen and soren were only in santa barbara for the ugly dogs indiana is 6 up from 15 last year the hoosiers were 1 in 2002 and 3 in 2003 maryland is 20 on the best party schools list but surely would be 1 on the best riot schools list if only such a list existed usc only shows up on two lists diverse student population 15 and students pack the stadiums 16 yet again east coast bias screws over the trojans more rankings info here and here pps im not sure if the law school rankings like the undergrad ones are new but notre dame law school comes in at 4 on the students lean to the right list behind ave maria regent and byu ppps

many of those who are like this street protester would probably oppose any solution that might actually deal with it effectively the sort of people who take to the streets protesting something like darfur are generally the same sort of people who are viscerally hostile toward military action and naively hopeful that kumbaya sounding internationalist solutions that have failed in the past will succeed this time around i realize thats a gross generalization but its also true as i recall the abovelinked protesters handouts called for urging congress to pass a resolution to urge the un to pass a resolution or something to that effect but michael totten is paying attention and he has no illusions about what needs to be done every day 500 black african muslims are murdered by islamists in sudans northwestern region of darfur the total number of dead now exceeds 400000 thats 133 september 11ths the us is airlifting 1200 rwandan troops for humanitarian relief its a nice gesture but thats all it is a token gesture actually stopping a genocidal regime and its death squads will take a lot more than a handful of rwandan troops it would require a fullscale military intervention by western powers the un where state sovereignty trumps human rights will never authorize anything of the sort if the west through nato or an ad hoc coalition of the willing doesnt put a stop to this soon the genocide wont likely end until it is complete so many cried out in unison after the holocaust never again never however turned out not to mean never again was the operative word terry georges recent film hotel rwanda ought to make short work of any doubts about that most everyone seems to agree these days that the entire world the us nato the un everybody failed rwanda president clinton later apologized for his part yet hardly anyone dares compare sudan and rwanda even though the similarities between the two could not be any more obvious hardly anyone wants to think about this i know hardly anyone wanted to think about bosnia either hardly anyone wanted to think about rwanda most of us will regret it later though if sudan does in fact become the next rwanda well regret it even

gondorian msm dems condemn aragorn 8202005 012800 am est posted by brendan loy watching the fellowship of the ring with becky earlier tonight my mind jumped ahead to the scene in return of the king where aragorn sends away the army of the dead after the victory at the pelennor fields but before the final battle at the black gates and it occurred to me that if gondor were a democracy with a free press the reaction surely would not have been very favorable gondor wins then army deserts invincible soldiers allowed to depart in apparent strategic blunder by king minas tirith was miraculously saved from certain destruction yesterday by the lastminute arrival of a mysterious army of the dead but defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory when the armys commander who claims to be the rightful king of gondor sent away the apparently invincible army instead of launching an immediate attack on saurons remaining forces i did what i had to do said the commander aragorn son of arathorn but with thousands of enemy troops believed to be lurking in nearby mordor and gondors regular army decimated by the disastrous days of battle that preceded the dead armys arrival many were unconvinced some even questioned aragorns motives this guy shows up on the same day that lord denethor dies saves gondor and then leaves us defenseless said democratic leader pelosi daughter of

the school year which starts monday regarding the website i am hoping to complete the switch to a new server and new blogging software wordpress by sunday thats not a promise but its my plan stay tuned cindy sheehan 8182005 123900 pm est posted by brendan loy i havent been following this whole cindy sheehan business very closely and i havent posted anything about it largely because i find it to be more spectacle than substance borne mostly out of the medias desperate need to find something to talk about in the midst of the annual august news drought rather than out of any desire to engage in serious discussion of the complex and deeply important issues at stake in iraq right now that said i do have a few passing thoughts about the matter and i thought id share them with yall as flamewar fodder if nothing else 1 i gather that some people on the right have been calling cindy sheehan a traitor or words to that effect thats outrageous dissent is not treason vigorous dissent is not treason even irrational vigorous dissent with which you disagree very very strongly is not treason and finally here comes the important controversial one dissent which happens as an unwelcome side effect to give aid and comfort to the enemy still is not treason it cant be treason if it were all wartime dissent would be potentially treasonous because domestic opposition always has the potential to embolden the enemy and declaring wartime dissent to be de facto treasonous would be an absolutely unacceptable result wartime dissent must be allowed it is necessary for the health of the republic for our freedom the very thing the troops are fighting for we must not allow ourselves to go down the road of saying that otherwise legitimate dissent is treasonous merely because it the unwanted side effect of pleasing our enemy saying that nothing which pleases our enemy can ever be right is just as foolish as saying that anything which displeases our enemy must always be right for example nuking mecca now if the dissent in question consists of saying i hope american troops die or if the intent of the dissent is to embolden the enemy then sure that s treasonous perhaps not legally but morally but if all youre saying is our policies are horrible were doing a very bad thing our president is a very bad man and our troops should come home this instant you might be an idiot but youre not a traitor 2 i gather that some people on the left are under the impression that cindy sheehan is immune to criticism that shes basically untouchable and should not under any circumstances be branded a crazy loony liberal or whathaveyou because her son died in iraq thats incorrect anyone who steps into the public limelight in the politically charged fashion that sheehan has clearly opens himself or herself up to be lambasted by political opponents any other conclusion would allow sympathetic figures on either side of any issue to render their political opponents completely defenseless clearly sheehan is trying to exploit her status as a sympathetic figure for political gain and its working and im not saying theres necessarily anything wrong with her doing that but to suggest that people should tread lightly on her public activism because of her personal loss is wrong if michael moore had made fahrenheit 911 in response to the death of his son in iraq would everyone have been obligated to refrain from criticizing its lies deceptions and faulty conclusions or to turn the tables a bit suppose zell millers antidemocrat tirade at last years republican national committee had been inspired by some sort of personal tragedy like perhaps his daughter having been driven off a bridge by ted kennedy or something would we have been forbidden because of sympathy from pointing out that hes a demogogic blowhard of course not and cindy sheehan doesnt get that privilege either not once shes stepped into the public eye and made a spectacle of herself for good or ill to tie together points 1 and 2 a healthy democratic discourse requires that cindy sheehan be allowed to harshly criticize the war effort without being branded a traitor and it also requires that the wars supporters be allowed to respond to her criticisms with equal harshness without being branded insensitive assholes finally 3 i dont see any particular reason why president bush should be obligated to meet with someone who calls him the biggest terrorist in the world im very sorry that she lost her son in iraq and im sure bush is too but if presidents were somehow morally obligated to meet with every wingy ideologue who experienced a personal tragedy that can be attributed to administration policy well lets just say i think that idea is nuts i mean what if some rightwing nutjob clintonhater had lost a son in bosnia to the extent that liberals and the msm are acting like bush is doing something outrageous by refusing to meet with sheehan and moreover acting like its obvious that its outrageous as jon stewart has been implicitly doing in his discussion of the issue on the daily show this week their premise is at the very least poorly thought out in the extreme and thats all i have to say about

a mountain 40 miles from athens is still baffling investigators and there is some suggestion that the greek governments almost immediate denial of terrorist involvement may have been premature in london the british pilots union urged greek authorities to release preliminary findings for the sake of the aviation industry there have been several apparently conflicting reports and a number of statements that just dont add up capt mervyn granshaw head of the british airline pilots association said without elaborating there is a concern in our industry to learn as quickly as possible what happened if there is too much delay the speculation will increase from the first the greek government has said the cause of the crash was likely technical failure and not terrorism but with so many unanswered questions industry experts said wednesday it was too soon to tell until they can absolutely rule it out theyve got to consider a terrorist act or some sort of sabotage as a potential factor said richard healing former member of the national transportation safety board two greek air force f16 jets were scrambled after the helios flight lost radio contact flew by the airliner over the aegean sea the f16 pilots reported seeing the pilots seat empty and the copilot slumped over the controls possibly unconscious according to the greek government the government also said the f16 pilots saw two unidentified people in the cockpit trying to regain control of the plane authorities have not released the fighter pilots account of the passenger jets final 23 minutes of flight or how it crashed but greek staterun and private media quoting anonymous defense ministry officials have said the f16 pilots also saw someone in the cockpit ‚Äî probably a man ‚Äî take control of the plane as it flew in a gradually descending holding pattern apparently on autopilot at about 37000 feet near athens airport that person then banked the plane away from athens lowering it first to 2000 feet and then climbing back up to 7000 feet before the plane apparently ran out of fuel and crashed for those maneuvers to happen someone who knew how to work the airplane had to have been in control said paul czysz emeritus professor of aeronautical engineering at st louis university the lack of air traffic control contact also was suspicious he added obviously he didnt want to contact the tower he said its happened before on oct 31 1999 the pilot of an egyptair flight from new york to cairo apparently directed the plane into the atlantic ocean off the coast of nantucket a crash that killed 217

prevented but thats not historically significant 8172005 123600 pm est posted by brendan loy the military source at the center of the able danger controversy the man who was infuriated by the legalisticpolitical obstructionism that prevented him from warning the fbi about mohammad attas terrorist cell in 2000 and who was subsequently ignored by the 911 commission when he told them what had happened has come forward publicly identifying himself as lt col anthony shaffer and elaborating on his story in a manner that puts the lie to the commissions preposterous assertion that the incident is not historically significant excerpt colonel shaffer said in an interview on monday night that the small highly classified intelligence program known as able danger had identified the terrorist ringleader mohamed atta and three other future hijackers by name by mid2000 and tried to arrange a meeting that summer with agents of the washington field office of the federal bureau of investigation to share its information but he said military lawyers forced members of the intelligence program to cancel three scheduled meetings with the fbi at the last minute which left the bureau without information that colonel shaffer said might have led to mr atta and the other terrorists while the sept 11 attacks were still being planned i was at the point of near insubordination over the fact that this was something important that this was something that should have been pursued colonel shaffer said of his efforts to get the evidence from the intelligence program to the fbi in 2000 and early 2001 he said he learned later that lawyers associated with the special operations command of the defense department had canceled the fbi meetings because they feared controversy if able danger was portrayed as a military operation that had violated the privacy of civilians who were legally in the united states it was because of the chain of command saying were not going to pass on information if something goes wrong well get blamed he said well guess what chain of command something went wrong and youve got some serious explaining to do the 911 commission also has some serious explaining to do the commission was set up in large part to answer the question how could this have happened and frankly i dont see how anyone can possibly deny that colonel shaffers uncontradicted account is the single most significant piece of information that has yet emerged with regard to the issue of how 911 could have happened forget all those tenuous speculative hindsightis2020 stories about how we wouldacouldashoulda seen the attack coming forget about the phoenix memo and the moussaoui affair this is the big magilla we had the 911 mastermind in our sights more than a year before the attacks and we did nothing and why did we do nothing not because we failed to connect the dots not because our intelligence services were asleep at the switch but because meddling lawyers concerned not about the dictates of the law but rather about the vagaries of public relations forced the investigators to cancel their meeting with the fbi and yet despite all that the 911 commission ignored colonel shaffers account he told them about this but they didnt put anything in their report about it not one word and now faced with the reality of their outrageously flagrant omission the cochairmen of the commission are telling us that the able danger fiasco is not historically significant this is both tragedy and farce i am truly and utterly flabbergasted sacrilege of the day 8172005

had emailed glenn reynolds of instapundit fame a link to my porn post i spontaneously announced i just instawhored myself to glenn becky laughed and said that should be in the dictionary figuring that google is the blogospheric equivalent of a dictionary i looked it up and lo and behold its not there the noun instawhore is there but not the verb form there is no mention of instawhored or instawhoring i think i just made up a new word now if youll excuse me i have to go instawhore my post about my invention of the word instawhore ps the origin of my new word is of course the verb to link whore my verb to instawhore is just a rather specific version of that concept much like the instalanche or as i stubbornly insist on continuing to call it instaboost pps actually looking up the definition i guess to link whore is a slightly different concept it involves shamelessly placing lots of links on your site to someone else s site presumably someone with more traffic than you in hopes that theyll link back but the concepts are certainly related putin goes supersonic oneupping bushs silly flightsuit act 8162005 064400 pm est posted by brendan loy vladimir putin i have a bigger than you george bush at least thats what im getting from this ideologues decry sensible idea of xxx domain 8162005 063000 pm est posted by brendan loy it strikes me as extraordinarily stupid for the bush administration or anyone else concerned about the prevalance of internet porn to object to the creation of a xxx domain reserved exclusively for porn sites they say they dont want to create a virtual redlight district but whereas the alternative to reallife redlight districts is to outlaw prostitution outlawing pornography is simply not an option in this country because of the first amendment so what exactly is the bushies alternative to a virtual redlight district hoping online porn magically disappears clearly thats not going to happen its one of the most lucrative industries in the world today period for those of us living in the realm of reality its obvious that there are just two realistic options leaving porn sites on the same domains as all other websites or confining them to a zone where people will be far less likely to accidentally stumble upon them the domain name being be a dead giveaway that hey this link goes to a porn site what do the bushies and other conservatives hope to accomplish other than making themselves feel pious by jettisoning a realistic solution in favor of more pointless censorious prattle what good will it do to essentially stick our heads in the sand pretending that perhaps porn will go away if we condemn it loudly enough all the while leaving it out in the open for everyone to see even little kids even by accident this strikes me as utterly stupid even by the standards of an administration that insists on the superiority of abstinenceonly education as usual joe lieberman is a lonely voice of reason hardly a propornography libertine the saintly senator and antismut crusader told a federal commission in 2000 pdf that an xxx domain is necessary as i understand it you are weighing the pros and cons of creating a special domain to accommodate xrated or other forms of adult content and segregate it away from kids this idea which would in effect establish a virtual redlight district has a lot of merit for rather than constricting the nets open architecture it would capitalize on it to effectively shield children from pornography and it would do so without encroaching on the rights of adults to have access to protected speech in doing this we would ask the arbiters of the internet to simply abide by the same standard as the proprietor of an xrated movie theater or the owner of a convenience store who sells sexuallyexplicit magazines lieberman is often accused of being overzealous when it comes to these sorts of issues but his stance here seems eminently reasonable note that he explicitly mentions the importance of free speech whereas the administrations stance seems totally nonsensical except from the perspective of trying to score points with their base i am willing to stand corrected on this if i am misunderstanding some aspect of the issue but as things currently stand i really dont see how the bushies position makes any logical sense update heres the family research councils take to some this may initially seem like a good idea but it is one that has been considered and rejected as ineffectual for years this will not require pornographers who are on the com domain to relocate to the xxx domain some naively suggest that passing a new law to force pornographers to move to xxx will solve the problem but that will not work either law means nothing to hardcore pornographers there already is a law prohibiting them from selling hardcore porn on the internet anywhere on the internet yet they have been doing if for years well im not sure what the frcs definition of hardcore is its my understanding that only obscenity can be banned and that is a very very limited type of hardcore porn but regardless it seems to me that this is a case of letting the great be the enemy of the good what if we can get 99 of porn sites to move to xxx or even 90 to a rational antipornography advocate isnt that better than 0 ps perhaps its the nomenclature that they dont like instead of xxx how about nsfw pps no comments from the peanut gallery about the phrase the bushies position but actually now that i mention it they do seem to have a rather missionary zeal quote of the day 8162005

howard dean needs to grow a brain 8152005 050600 pm est posted by brendan loy doctor screech strikes again as of today it looks like women will be worse off in iraq than they were when saddam hussein was president of iraq hollerin howard makes a simple but catastrophic mistake in his thought process here he is clearly considering only the legal status of women in the old vs the new iraq and concluding therefrom that they will be worse off in the new one but thats absurd for the obvious reason that peoples wellbeing under tyrannical regimes like saddams is not determined by legal niceties authoritarian governments often have constitutions that guarantee all sorts of rights to the people china is a great example of this but these constitutions arent worth the paper theyre printed on theyre meaningless because under a government like saddams the tyrant and his henchmen completely control the entire machinery of government including the legal system therefore the only people who actually get to redeem their rights are the people who are in the tyrants good graces so while it may be true that women had more legal rights under saddams government than they will under the new interim iraqi constitution and if so i dont deny that thats a problem that absolutely does not mean that they will be worse off i am not an expert on iraq by any means but i venture to guess that most shiite and kurdish women would disagree rather strongly with deans statement even many sunnis would probably take issue with it in fact im thinking the only women who will truly be worse off are the women who were connected to the baath party and were therefore relatively safe from the saddamites cruelty the rest of the countrys women are going to be better off in the new iraq because everyone whether male or female is going to be better off in the new iraq that howard dean can not grasp this is really rather unsettling one need not have supported the war to recognize that saddams regime was very very bad and even a deeply imperfect replacement government is still an improvement whether the us had sufficient justification to bring about that improvement and whether it was necessary and prudent to do so is a separate issue now having lambasted dean let me switch sides and take issue with the republican national committees response to his latest gaffe the rnc said deans wild assertion that iraqi women would be better off living under saddam hussein than democracy is not only counterproductive to meaningful debate it demeans the hard work of american servicemen and women serving in iraq ugh if anything is counterproductive to meaningful debate its the rncs bullying deans statement is actually quite beneficial to meaningful debate since it is so easily rebutted why look at the little minidebate ive having with myself right here the rncs statement on the other hand attempts to suppress debate by chilling dissent implying that no one should utter anything which might suggest that our brave militarys hard work has been for naught but thats crap deans statement isnt wrong because it demeans the hard work of american servicemen and women serving in iraq its wrong because its wrong if deans statement were factually true then he would be absolutely right to say it regardless of whether or not it is appreciated by our brave hardworking soldiers and i mean that with all sincerity i really do we ought not blind ourselves from unpleasant realities merely because we want to support the troops indeed thats not supporting them at all thats subverting the very thing theyre fighting for our freedom which includes the freedom nay the duty to criticize our government when it deserves to be criticized if it were true that our brave militarys hard work has been for naught and i dont at present believe this but i also dont exclude the possibility that it may heaven forbid become true then it wouldnt demean our troops to point this out to the contrary it would be our civic duty to point this out and to hold accountable the administration which allowed our militarys hard work to be squandered what would demean our troops would be to pretend like nothing is wrong and continue to support the bumbling fools in washington whose mistakes ruined their gallant efforts so valid criticisms can and should be made and the rnc should stop implying otherwise deans criticism however is not a valid one indeed its a profoundly stupid one poorly thought out in the extreme not to mention politically tonedeaf the good bad doctor should be summarily fired from his dnc leadership position for saying something so utterly dumb of course he should have been summarily fired several months ago for saying various other equally dumb things hell he never should have been hired in the first place so i dont hold out much hope that it will finally happen now remembering the blackout 8152005 015200 pm est posted by brendan loy a truly momentous event passed yesterday without my notice the second anniversary of the great blackout of 2003 i was in new york during the blackout and it is one of my favorite events to reminisce about the ultimate i was there moment for someone who really really likes to be there when interesting things happen actually the blackout is more than that its one of my very favorite life experiences period that may seem odd but id always thought that it would be really cool to be in new york city during a massive power outage like the one they had in 1965 and on august 14 2003 i found out that i was right it was really cool i blogged the whole thing of course starting with this proxy post typed out by my dad from unaffected connecticut unfortunately the chaotic state of the blog archives at the moment makes it a little difficult to navigate through everything but if you start with the abovelinked post and keep clicking the next post link you can read and see and hear everything i posted like this moblog post from times square and much later these cool satellite pics of the blackouts effects and this map of how i got home and theres lots more on the other hand if you only have 15 minutes to kill rather than three hours you can go straight to my blackout story excerpt i was working in a 13thfloor loft in tribeca when the lights went out initially i thought it was just my half of the loft that had lost power i soon realized the other half was also in the dark then one of my bosses richard proclaimed i have no idea where he got his information that the whole building a 17story structure that is also home to mariah carey was out of power i started typing out a cell phone photopost to the blog announcing that our office had lost power and we had reports that the whole building might be out in the midst of my typing this my other boss lyn came in and said that one of richards employees had said the whole city plus long island and new jersey was out my immediate reaction was extreme skepticism i asked who the employee had heard this from and where that person had gotten his information lyn didnt know so i typed something into my cell phone that was extremely wishywoshy on the point of whether the city was out of power i had a better sense that something might really be wrong though when my attempt at moblogging failed as i was unable to get through on my cell phone it began to seem more and more plausible that the whole city was out of power and that like on 911 everyone was reaching for their cell phones at the same time jamming the network we had no tv and no internet of course and it took quite a long time before somebody got a batterypowered radio out i didnt even think of radio as a source of information in fact until someone mentioned it even so it quickly became clear from the glut of traffic the honking and the sirens that were visible andor audible outside our windows that something was happening beyond just our building the extent became clear when i finally got through via phone to my dad in what one of my coworkers later described as a surreal moment i repeated aloud the names of affected cities that my dad was reading to me from a cnn article detroit cleveland boston albany toronto ottawa that really was a dramatic moment heres another excerpt from several hours later scott will and i sat around outside for a while eventually concluding that we would head toward the greenwich village apartment of one of scotts friends on the way there though we stopped at a grocery store where as someone carrying a bag from the store informed us they were giving away all sorts of perishables for free or very reduced prices we got a ton of free milk several salads and a bunch of other stuff for a total of 190 finally as the sun began to set we started walking in earnest toward the apartment in the village where scott and will stayed over last night but i decided i didnt want to hole myself up inside just yet this was a onceinalifetime experience and i wanted to really experience it i had always wondered somewhat jealously what it must have been like for new yorkers in 65 and 77 to see this city in the dark and now was my chance so without any clear idea where i would be sleeping or what i would do once it got fully dark i started walking toward times square it goes on from there of course read the whole thing naturally i took a lot of photos during the blackout you can view them here unfortunately only the thumbnails are visible the links to the fullsize versions are broken as are many other links on that

was declared renegade when it entered greek air space and failed to make radio contact causing two f16 air force jets to scramble to investigate the plane was on a flight from larnaca to prague with a stop in athens when it came down 40 km 25 miles north of the greek capital greek authorities ruled out hijacking or terrorism links to the crash greek defense ministry officials said 90 minutes elapsed between the alert being raised at 1030 am and the plane crashing at 1203 pm greek government spokesman theodore roussopoulos said f16 pilots sent to investigate reported that with the pilots out of action there may have been a lastgasp effort by others on the plane to bring it back under control the f16s saw two individuals in the cockpit seemingly trying to regain control of the airplane roussoupoulos told reporters it was not known if they were passengers or other crew the f16s also saw oxygen masks down when they got close to the aircraft the aircraft was making continuous righthand turns to show it had lost radio contact a passenger on the doomed plane said in an sms text to his cousin in athens the pilot has turned blue cousin farewell were freezing the defense ministry said it suspected the planes oxygen supply or pressurisation system may have malfunctioned which could have led to death within seconds for all on board okay a couple of things first of all if the alert was raised at 1030 am and the plane crashed at 1203 pm thats not nearly an hour its more than an hour and a half secondly the abovequoted text message and the sighting of people trying to take control of the plane does not lend itself to a death within seconds hypothesis either way the whole thing is creepy and of course horribly sad understanding the enemy 8132005 114500 pm est posted by brendan loy theres a lot of talk on the left about understanding the terrorists and their motives however as i pointed out elsewhere on this blog recently the preferred method of understanding is generally to listen to liberal intellectuals explain why the terrorists hate us which in my experience really means listening to liberal intellectuals explain why they think the third world ought to hate us this is a grave mistake if our goal is true understanding of the people who want to kill us noam chomsky may be very upset about various things but hes exceedingly unlikely to fly a plane into a building anytime soon which makes his views considerably less important to understand than say mohammad attas or ayman alzawahiris as victor hanson says throughout this war we have an understandable if ethnocentric habit of ignoring what our enemies actually say instead we chatter on dont listen and in selfabsorbed fashion impart our own motives for their hatred we live on the principles of the enlightenment and so worship our god reason thus assuming that even our adversaries accept such rational protocols as their own so they talk on and on of beheading suicide bombing another holocaust and blowing thousands of us up while we snooze now and again waking in the midst of a war to regurgitate abu ghraib guantanamo bay flushed korans the abusive patriot act and the latest quip of donald rumsfeld as we try to assess the causes of islamists venom toward the west it seems wiser to listen to what they say rather than what we say they say of course we cant be certain that any individual statement from an islamist is an honest one its clear that the terrorist leaders like all good politicians are only too happy to cite popular grievances that will appeal to their base regardless of whether the hardcore terrorists really care about those grievances but if we read their statements closely and discerningly we can get a much better idea of their motives than ward churchill or noam chomsky can possibly provide by ticking off a laundry list of liberal grievances against the west nor i hasten to add lest i be accused again of only criticizing liberals than george w bush can possibly provide by simplistically declaring that they hate freedom and so forth in other words liberals are right that we need to understand our enemy and that conservatives arent making that enough of a priority but entirely wrong in terms of how theyre going about it there may be kernels of truth in what the farlefties say and there is certainly some truth imho in what bush says but neither side has it entirely right because both sides are doing too much talking and not enough listening my strong suspicion is that if we listened closely enough wed begin to understand that the enemy is even more frightening and grotesque than many of us currently suspect and a lot more of us would grasp it vital necessity of a broadlydefined war on terror or global struggle against violent extremism or whatever theyre calling it today it all goes back to hitchens its them or me or perhaps more to the point it all goes back to sheikh omar bakri mohammed who would like to see the islamic flag fly not only over number 10 downing street but over the whole world everybody understand that because im hearing it loud and clear alan sullivan sums all of this up very succinctly too many westerners ignore the jihad as they might ignore unruly children at a restaurant our enemies are not children nor are they inferior theyre just dickheads heh indeed ps more here the truth is after 911 were not engaged in nation building were engaged in planet building i completely agree with hitchens on this point we should consistently act against internationalist totalitarian ideologies out of both principle and realism if you dont fight them now you fight them later we cant live on the same planet as them and im glad because i dont want to are you listening king abdullah tropical update 8132005

fridaycatblog yesterday the 911 commission lied people died 8132005 052500 pm est posted by brendan loy captains quarters blog has some truly excellent coverage of the ongoing snowballing debacle surrounding the 911 commission and able danger the militaryintelligence operation that identified mohammad atta and his new yorkbased terror cell in 2000 much remains obscured in the fog of war or is it the fog of bureaucracy but one thing is now perfectly clear lee hamilton and other members of the 911 commission were extremely deceptive at best and outandout lied at worst when initially asked whether they were briefed about able danger their story has changed so many times in the last few days i simply can not think of any innocent explanation for it captain ed provides a succinct summary this constant shifting of the story underscores the massive credibility deficit that the commission has now earned first they never heard of able danger then maybe a lowlevel staffer told them about the program but not the atta identification next the military met with the commissioners but didnt specify the atta identification now we finally have confirmation that the commission itself not just its lowlevel staff knew that military intelligence had identified mohammed atta as an alqaeda operative a year before 911 instead of reporting it the commission buried it if you have a halfhour or so to bring yourself up to speed on something thats really quite important i highly recommend the captains quarters coverage all relevant posts are on the linked page although reading em in the proper sequence is a bit annoying as you have to scroll down to the bottom and then keep scrolling up and down and up again but its worth it the bottom line is that it looks like the commission decided early to pin blame on the intelligence community rather than the bureaucracy which stripped it of its ability to act in the interests of our security potential leads which did not fit into that preconceived story line were summarily dismissed or at the very least not investigated as thoroughly as they should have been as ed writes instead of saying to themselves hey wait a minute this changes the picture substantially and postponing the report until they could look further into able danger they simply shrugged their shoulders and published what they had why able danger proved that at least some of the intelligence work done by the us provided the information that could have helped prevent or at least reduce the attacks on 911 they had identified the ringleader of the conspiracy as a terrorist agent even if they didnt know what mission he had at the time what does that mean for the commissions findings it meant that the cornerstone of their conclusions no longer fit the facts able danger showed that the us had enough intelligence to take action if the government had allowed law enforcement and intelligence operations to cooperate with each other it also showed that data mining could effectively identify terrorist agents so what did the commission do it ignored those facts which did not fit within its predetermined conclusions it never bothered to mention able danger even one time in its final report even though that absolutely refuted the notion that the government had no awareness that atta constituted a terrorist threat it endorsed the idea of data mining which would die in congress as the total information awareness program without ever explaining why and while the clinton policy of enforcing a quarantine between law enforcement and intelligence operations came under general criticism their report never included the fact that the wall for which commission member jamie s gorelick had so much responsibility specifically contributed to attas ability to come and go as he pleased building the teams that would kill almost 3000 americans and when confronted with this revelation this week the commission lied about their knowledge of the program and attempted to impugn rep curt weldons integrity instead heres what lee hamilton one of the commissions cochairs had to say just yesterday on the topic the sept 11 commission did not learn of any us government knowledge prior to 911 of surveillance of mohammed atta or of his cell said hamilton a former democratic congressman from indiana had we learned of it obviously it wouldve been a major focus of our investigation that statement from hamilton has since been shown to be a sly clintonesque deception at best does a uniformed militaryintelligence officers report count as us government knowledge and an outright lie at worst like so many cornered politicians before them hamilton and other members of the commission are engaging in an unseemly bit of flipflopping with regard to the facts of what happened that is intolerable and the 911 commission report is now officially damaged goods nothing from that commission has a shred of credibility until we get to the bottom of this as captain ed asks what else got left out because of inconvenience the able danger fiasco raises all sorts of questions some of which relate to iraq which we perhaps thought were answered but which now clearly merit at least a second look since the historical record on which weve been relying is obiovusly deeply flawed im inclined to agree with captain ed when he says we need to start rethinking this from the beginning dump the preconceived notions and gather all of the evidence together to understand what really happened to us on 911 and also until we have officials with some accountability look into the evidence instead of a panel comprised of people like former clinton official jamie gorelick who allegedly played a major role in constructing the bureaucratic wall which prevented intelligencesharing who have axes to grind and actions to minimize we will never get a clear factual look at the performance of our intelligence services and the constraints put on them by bureaucrats more interested in political correctness than in national security side note this is really an excellent example of the useful function which the blogosphere at its best can perform the mainstream medias reports on a complicated developing fastchanging story like this with multiple strands of incomplete but important information often connected by one part circumstantial evidence and two parts speculation are inevitably going to fall short of promoting a full understanding of what the hell is going on for one thing there isnt enough space in a newspapers pages to do such a story justice whereas an obsessed blogger has no space restraints and possibly fewer time restraints as well secondly and more importantly unbiased newspaper and tv reporters are limited in their ability to connect the dots because doing so requires expressing a length opinion about what are the most plausible answers to the various unanswered questions such speculation even if wellfounded wellsourced and logically sound will generally be seen to violate objectivity if its coming from the reporters brain it would need to come from an outside source and unless youre going to quote that source for multiple consecutive paragraphs youre never going to get a thorough analysis that way so if youre getting your news about able danger from a newspaper or heaven forbid a cable news channel youre really getting a rather superficial look at what is going on todays headline might be commission denies knowing about atta tomorrows headline might be commission admits knowing about atta but what does it all mean all youre getting is a bunch of disconnected snapshots by contrast a good blogger like captain ed can delve deeply into the known facts and can speculate openly about the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns and all that but if its done right as it is in this case his speculation is fully transparent with its factual basis explained completely and its logical underpinnings outlined articulately that means a reader with a different interpretation of the facts can look at what ed has written and draw his own conclusions and post it in eds comments or on his own blog thus a real dialogue can occur and intelligent readers can come away with a much better grasp on the situation than from reading an incomplete newspaper report the incompleteness of which may very well mislead by omission now of course an unintelligent or lazy reader may look at captain eds blog ignore the caveats like does any of this constitute proof no and conclude something unwarranted like this able danger thing proves that saddam attacked us on 911 but thats not a strike against captain ed or against blogs generally its a strike against unintelligent lazy readers who could and would jump to similarly unjustified conclusions from reading the paper or watching tv likewise coverage by an unintelligent or lazy blogger or one who is not merely biased which we all are but is so biased that it hampers hisher ability to think rationally will also be unhelpful and perhaps even harmful to a full understanding of the issue but the same can be said of lazy journalists and i would contend that the informal meritocracy which allows good blogs to gain wide audiences ie prominent bloggers link those who say goodinteresting things readers stick around if the blog stays goodinteresting go elsewhere if it doesnt generally works better than the formalized attempts at meritocracy in many journalistic institutions the system that for example made jayson blair a bigname reporter and that to this day keeps letting the utterly pedestrian maureen dowd write weekly columns for the nations most prominent newspaper of course bloggers generally rely on others specifically the mainstream journalists we love to bash to do the actual reporting well unless the reporting involves some form of internet research which incidentally is a rich reporting tool that mainstream journalists often fail to use as productively as they should and bloggers often pick up the slack here but thats fine the blogosphere need not replace the mainstream media in order to be recognized as serving a thoroughly worthwhile purpose we supplement the msm theyre better at the reporting but we are often better at the analysis which in a story like this is at least as important as the reporting kiss irene goodbye 8132005 030900 pm est posted by brendan loy barring a totally unexpected reversal irene is no longer a threat to the united states mainland or any land for that matter alan sullivan at fresh bilge notes all models now agree that irene will stay well offshore and the storm has already turned more to the north dr jeff masters writes last nights mission by noaas giv aircraft gathered a large highresolution set of data surrounding irene and this data was used to initialize this mornings models these models continue to show that irene will turn to the north and northeast missing the us coast by a wide margin this is a highconfidence forecast due to the excellent data used to initialize the models and the continuity of the model forecasts from yesterday to today irene has also apparently weakened significantly as of the last advisory at 1000 am she was still officially at 70 mph though the nhc expressed some doubt about whether that was perhaps too high but shortly after that advisory was issued the hurricane hunters just paid a visit to irene and found a substantially weaker tropical storm the central pressure was just 1000 mb and maximum flightlevel winds were 40 mph on the west side of the storm thats according to dr masters again so the 400 pm advisory will probably announce that irene is substantially weaker the 400 pm advisory may also announce the formation of tropical depression 10 a thousand miles east of the lesser antilles dr masters has an initial take on the protodepression the storm will continue to move to the northwest or westnorthwest over the next few days not posing a threat to any islands until perhaps wednesday the gfs model moves the storm northwest bypassing the caribbean islands then tracks it on a more westerly course towards the us late next week the storm is headed into an area of very dry air to its northwest which may inhibit its growth and intensification however water temperatures are warm 28 30c ahead of it and vertical wind shear is light so it is likely that it will attain at least tropical storm status if so it will be named jose in other news today is the oneyear anniversary of the florida landfall of hurricane charley the first and arguably worst

island or so we have always thought but thanks to google maps and my 360¬∞ panorama of our island i determined a few minutes ago that we were actually marooned on a desert peninsula heh either way it was definitely a crowning moment in our wonderful history together ah the memories full story here more photos here and here update hmm comparing this satellite map to googles satellite map its clear that the spot where we got stranded is sometimes an island and sometimes part of a peninsula depending on the water level of the lake whether the lowlying isthmus was underwater one year ago tonight making the peninsula an island i dont know i suspect probably not as the water level was quite low when we were there but who knows maybe it was even lower when google took its satellite pictures so its possible anyway that we were on a desert island after all ps look at the righthand side of this picture and youll see the lowlying strip of rock that connects gunsight butte to our island you cant actually see our island it would be off to the right beyond the edge of the photo but you can see the isthmus of the sometimepeninsula on the other hand heres another picture of the same spot taken when the water level was higher no isthmus is visible our island really was an island at that time a child after my own heart 8132005 025600 am est posted by brendan loy paula abdul you are safe

models are now pretty much unanimous in predicting a sharp recurvature out to sea update 3 nope still a tropical storm with 70 mph winds but this is interesting a noaa giv jet aircraft and an air force reserve aircraft have been conducting synoptic surveillance missions around irene this evening dropsonde data from those aircraft indicate a slightly stronger and more westward extension of the midlevel ridge than any of the models were indicating for 1300zwith the ukmet having the closest verification the ridgealbeit somewhat narrowextends from near bermuda westward to north carolina a shortwave trough has moved eastward off the us east coast and a shortwave ridge over the eastern ohio valley is moving eastward to take the place of that trough in the short termthis should build or at least maintain the existing ridge to the north of irenewhich may cause a little more westward motion than forecast for the next 24 hours or so after thatall the models agree that irene will erode the ridge and move slowly northward through the ridge between 7072w longitudeand then turn eastnortheastward by 72 hours howevergiven more ridge showing up in the synoptic dropsonde data there may be a westward shift in the 00z model guidance maybe im wrong about this after all im not a real meteorologist i just play one on tv the internet but a forecast that calls for a storm to erode the ridge and then move through it strikes me as considerably less certain than one that calls for the storm to be passively acted upon by outside forces like wellestablished ridges and troughs put another way tropical cyclones direct interactions with other types of weather systems can be unpredictable what if irene doesnt erode the ridge will she just sit and spin or could she then move west or north still it does seem very likely that irene will float harmlessly out to sea the yettobeofficiallydeclared tropical depression ten potentially tropical storm jose may be a different story heres a

anonymous commenter some of us may start to actually believe that if youd post something that criticizes the right for anything other than their stance on gay rights this is an utterly ignorant attack on me i have posted plenty of things during my 40 months of blogging that criticize the right for all sorts of stuff my archives readily demonstrate this just because some on the left cant handle the idea of someone who criticizes fools and knaves on both sides of the aisle doesnt make me any less of a democrat if im slightly harder on the fools and knaves on my side its only because their actions reflect poorly on me which pisses me off and also perhaps because i feel that i have a better chance of bringing about change in the party that im a part of rather than the one that im screaming at from the sidelines it is perfectly legitimate of course to disagree with specific choices that i make in terms of which instances of foolishness and knavery i choose to criticize and which i dont bother with i dont always make the right choices sometimes i ignore or downplay things that i should be paying more attention to and sometimes i overemphasize things that arent really that big a deal im not perfect and i dont claim to be but the sweeping accusation that i only criticize liberals is simply false and the implication that im therefore not a real democrat is just foolish if i decide to forswear the democratic party and stop voting for its candidates in most elections including both presidential elections since i turned 18 ill let yall know it hasnt happened yet along the same lines as anonymous lawgeek says that i and my cohorts on this blog perpetually attack and critique the left well so far as i know i dont have cohorts i think and speak for myself and no one else speaks for me but with regard to what i perpetually do its true that i attack fellow liberals and democrats when i feel they deserve it which unfortunately is quite often at the moment the democratic party and the left as a whole desperately need to wake up and grapple with reality and im not going to shy away from pointing that out i firmly believe that it is important for the sake of the country and the world to have a vibrant vocal and rational left presenting a reasonable alternative to the conservative agenda at the moment i do not believe we have such a left the vocal left is mostly irrational and the rational left isnt very vibrant or vocal largely because the noisy loonies drown them out i believe that situation needs to be rectified i hope in some small way to participate in the process of rectifying it in contrast to my mom who believes that liberals should focus 100 of our energies on attacking the republicans and not waste our time with internecine warfare i firmly believe that internecine warfare is absolutely necessary at this particular moment in our history the 2004 elections conclusively demonstrated that energy and relentless attacking are not enough to win we libs dems need to clean up our own act before we can possibly hope to convince the public at large that we should be running the country it was for the second consecutive presidential election the left that defeated itself in 2004 it should therefore be a top priority for the left to fix itself but that doesnt mean i dont criticize republicans too thats just ridiculous as i said browse my archives but hey you want something new and specific okay fine yesterday i received a mass email from the national republican party accusing the democrats of election fraud and using the 2004 washington gubernatorial race as an example specifically the email referred to those king county ballots that were found the gops scare quotes not mine and added to the vote tally during the recount hot on the heels of my antinaral tirade i wrote back to the national gop in a rage as someone who followed the washington gubernatorial election quite closely i must say that your use of quotation marks aka scare quotes around the word found in the description of those king county ballots is completely outrageous there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that those ballots were in any way illegitimate they were in fact found and within the recount deadline at that there was never any plausible or credible allegation just a lot of unjustified innuendo that anything was wrong with those ballots there was never any suggestion that anyone forged them or altered them or anything like that yes there were other allegations of fraud in the election but they did not relate to those ballots what happened with those ballots was a simple administrative error the correction of which is precisely why we have recounts and thank god it was fixed before the deadline or hundreds of voters ballots would have gone uncounted i dont care who they voted for votes which are validly cast should count those were real votes cast by real voters and regardless of whether the judges other decisions were right or wrong he was absolutely right to count those ballots by implying without any factual basis that those ballots were fraudulent you sink to the same level as other scurrilous deceitful liars like naral and michael moore shame on you the democrats are wrong to keep harping on the 2000 florida election having been stolen and you are wrong to harp on the 2004 washington gubernatorial election both of these were simply very close elections statistical ties really in which every little tiny error and problem was magnified a thousandfold due to the closeness of the race it is entirely counterproductive and wrong indeed borderline unamerican to dishonestly make unfounded accusations that diminish public confidence in the election process simply for partisan gain leave that crap to jesse jackson will you making legitimate accusations is perfectly right and proper of course but using scarequotes to refer skeptically to those perfectly valid ballots is not a legitimate accusation i lost faith a while ago in the washington state republican partys ability to deal equitably and fairly with this issue but i expect better from the national gop again shame on you ps why do you think we have recounts in the first place if not to correct blatant errors like the accidental failure to count several hundred validly cast ballots pps how would you have felt if those ballots had been found in a republican county would you be casting the same aspersions what if they were military ballots does the hypocrisy never end so there you go brendan loy lambasting republicans when they deserve it just as fiercely as i lambaste democrats when they deserve it and yes i was planning all along to post this email to the blog today even before the abovequoted comments forced the issue this really isnt much of a mystery people just because im not a blind partisan doesnt mean im playing for the other team thats the sort of smalltent mentality that will relegate the democratic party to permanent minority status nor to strike at the heart of whats perhaps the real issue here does the fact i earnestly believe the war in iraq was and is justified mean that i am not a real democrat hawks can be democrats too and so can rational people who dont agree with all the liberal orthodoxies but who agree even less with the conservative ones like i said were a big tent right well im staying under the tent until somebody kicks me out or until it becomes too noxious to stick around and that hasnt happened yet though dick durbin did his best a few weeks ago the bottom line is this i dont call myself a democrat just for rhetorical advantage i call myself a democrat because i am a democrat like i said if that changes i will let you know im honestly not sure who my cohorts would be if lawgeek means the guestbloggers andor the frequent commenters they span the political spectrum from pinko and weenie to capitalista and troglodyte to say nothing of the various ideologues so i dont think it can fairly be said that there is any united ideological crusade going on here come on irene pick a track 8122005 075400 am est posted by brendan loy heres a

district note that the dotted black line is not a computer model but rather the linear extension of irenes current forward motion with the exception of the bamm or as i like to call it the emeril

that us landfall remains possible with capes hatteras and cod the most plausible targets anniversary attack 8122005 024800 am est posted by brendan loy the new york times reports a group of fbi counterterrorism analysts warned this week of possible terrorist attacks in new york los angeles and chicago around sept 11 but officials cautioned on thursday that they were skeptical about the seriousness of the threat the warning grew out of intelligence developed from an overseas source indicating that terrorists might seek to steal fuel tanker trucks in order to inflict mass casualties by staging an anniversary attack officials said several government officials in washington who were briefed on the threat said it was described as credible and specific enough to warrant attention but other law enforcement officials in washington and new york said that while they were aware of the warnings and were concerned about the sept 11 anniversary they remained somewhat skeptical about the latest threat september 11 falls on a sunday this year so presumably any attack would come on sept 9 or sept 12 or some other weekday around then its easier to inflict mass casualties when people are at work crammed into downtown commercial districts and such well unless the target is a football stadium in other 911related news it seems the didactic and inappropriate international freedom center is having some roadblocks placed in its path by the ground zero reconstruction planners good give it the boot put the exhibits about apartheid and iraq somewhere else let the 911 memorial be about 911 irene to new england probably not 8122005 021500 am est posted by brendan loy as of 1000 pm tropical storm irene is still at 50 mph and still posing a vague uncertain threat to north carolina heres the forecast track florida state meteorology student charles fenwick at eye of the storm has an update in which he kindly answers a question from the peanut gallery via comments brendan loy asks what chances i think irene has of affecting new england the scenario is what my virginiacentric state of mind has thought of as the overshoot scenario the storm makes an approach to the outer banks but turns parallel to the coast and runs north until it finds land the most recent example of it in pure form is bob of 1991 which affected my family since we were living in brunswick maine at the time gloria of 1985 is another due to the uncertainties of a five day forecast it is a bit hard to have high confidence in rating the probability of such a scenario but here goes anyway im a bit too young to be familiar with the atmospheric setup that caused those tracks however one can reckon the positioning of high pressure that would have caused such a track it seems like it would take the center to be positioned to be either a little bit further north than is normal or elongated northsouth and somewhat off the coast one thing noticable about these types of storms is that they are very much under the influence of a welldefined steering current as their forward progress increases tremendously as they pass the outer banks looking at what setup appears to be i dont see such a scenario ocurring right now the options plausible to me are a quick turn out to sea or a stallnearstall off the coast that leaves the storm spinning until the next front passes through carrying the storm off to the east i dont think there are any examples of storms approaching the coast slowly in the fashion that some models are creeping irene forward in the midlate term of their forecasts and then lurching to the north in other words irene seems more likely to be an emily or a felix than a bob or a gloria victory 8112005 093600 pm est posted by brendan loy naral has yanked its egregiously offensive

taken a position on the ad why the hell not whats so hard about condemning malicious lies oh right because no one in the democratic party is willing to rock the boat and piss off naral argh what a bunch of wimps so much for sister souljah kudos to prochoice republican arlen specter who did what the dems couldnt bring themselves to do publicly declaring the ad blatantly untrue and unfair perhaps ill vote for him for the democratic nomination in 2008 well said 8112005 085600 pm est posted by brendan loy christopher hitchens on the islamists they gave us no peace and we shouldnt give them any we cant live on the same planet as them and im glad because i dont want to i dont want to breathe the same air as these psychopaths and murders and rapists and torturers and child abusers its them or me its a duty and a responsibility to defeat them he also explains how the left got 911 wrong the september 11 attacks were one of those rare historical moments like 1933 in germany or 1936 in spain or 1968 when you are put in a position to take a strong stand for what is right the left failed this test instead of strongly standing against these nihilistic murderers people on the left such as noam chomsky began to make excuses for these murderers openly saying that bin laden was however crude in his methods in some ways voicing a liberation theology this is simply a moral and political collapse but its not only that its a missed opportunity for the left think of it this way if a group of theocratic nihilists drive planes full of human beings into buildings full of human beings announcing nothing by way of a program except their nihilism and if they turn out to have been sheltered by two regimes favored by the united states and the national security establishment pakistan and saudi arabia to be precise two of only three countries to recognize the taliban and if republicans were totally taken by surprise by this and if the working class of new york had to step forward and become the shield of society in the person of the fire and police brigades it seemed to me that this would have been a good opportunity for the left to demand a general revision of all the assumptions we carried about the postcold war world we were attacked by a religious dictatorship and the working class were pushed into defending elites by the total failure of our leadership and total failure of our intelligence the attack emanated partly from the failure of regimes supported by that same elite national security establishment pakistan and saudi arabia if the left cant take advantage of a moment like that whats it for whats its secularism for whats its internationalism class attitude democracy for you dont get that many measurable historical moments in your life but you must recognize them when they come this was one of those moments and the left collectively decided to get it wrong and i realized at that moment that to borrow a slogan that slightly irritates me but is useful not in my name im not part of that family i wanted to force a split a political split on the left to which a small extent i think succeeded today there is a small proregime change left and im a proud part of it as am i hat tip michael totten who on a not entirely unrelated note also points out that the guardian today published an oped column by an al qaedalinked islamist",

First they never heard of Able Danger. Then, maybe a low-level staffer told them about the program but not the Atta identification. Next, the military met with the Commissioners but didn't specify the Atta identification. Now, we finally have confirmation that the Commission itself -- not just its low-level staff -- knew that military intelligence had identified Mohammed Atta as an al-Qaeda operative a year before 9/11. Instead of reporting it, the Commission buried it. If you have a half-hour or so to bring yourself up to speed on something that's really quite important, I highly recommend the \n\n\n\nThe \n\n Why? Able Danger proved that at least some of the intelligence work done by the US provided the information that could have helped prevent or at least reduce the attacks on 9/11. They had identified the ringleader of the conspiracy as a terrorist agent, even if they didn't know what mission he had at the time.\n\n\n\nWhat does that mean for the Commission's findings? It meant that the cornerstone of their conclusions no longer fit the facts. Able Danger showed that the US had enough intelligence to take action -- if the government had allowed law enforcement and intelligence operations to cooperate with each other. It also showed that data mining could effectively identify terrorist agents.\n\n\n\nSo what did the Commission do? It ignored those facts which did not fit within its predetermined conclusions. It never bothered to mention Able Danger even one time in its final report, even though that absolutely refuted the notion that the government had no awareness that Atta constituted a terrorist threat. It endorsed the idea of data mining (which would die in Congress as the Total Information Awareness program) without ever explaining why. And while the Clinton policy of enforcing a quarantine between law enforcement and intelligence operations came under general criticism, their report never included the fact that the \"wall\" for which Commission member Jamie S. Gorelick had so much responsibility specifically contributed to Atta's ability to come and go as he pleased, building the teams that would kill almost 3,000 Americans.\n\n\n\nAnd when confronted with this revelation this week, the Commission lied about their knowledge of the program and attempted to impugn Rep. Curt Weldon's integrity instead. Here's what Lee Hamilton, one of the Commission's co-chairs, had to say just yesterday on the topic:\n\n\n\n\"The Sept. 11 commission did not learn of any U.S. government knowledge prior to 9/11 of surveillance of Mohammed Atta or of his cell,\" said Hamilton, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana. \"Had we learned of it obviously it would've been a major focus of our investigation.\" That statement from Hamilton has since been shown to be a sly Clintonesque deception at best (does a uniformed military-intelligence officer's report count as \"U.S. government knowledge\"?), and an outright lie at worst. Like so many cornered politicians before them, Hamilton and other members of the Commission are engaging in an unseemly bit of flip-flopping with regard to the facts of what happened. That is intolerable, and the 9/11 Commission Report is now officially damaged goods. Nothing from that Commission has a shred of credibility until we get to the bottom of this. As Captain Ed \n\n\n\nThe Able Danger fiasco raises all sorts of questions -- some of which relate to Iraq -- which we perhaps thought were answered, but which now clearly merit at least a second look, since the \"historical record\" on which we've been relying is obiovusly deeply flawed. I'm inclined to agree with Captain Ed when he all of the evidence together to understand what really happened to us on 9/11.\" And \n\n\n\nSide note: This is really an excellent example of the useful function which the blogosphere -- at its best -- can perform. The mainstream media's reports on a complicated, developing, fast-changing story like this, with multiple strands of incomplete but important information, often connected by one part circumstantial evidence and two parts speculation, are inevitably going to fall short of promoting a full understanding of what the hell is going on. For one thing, there isn't enough space in a newspaper's pages to do such a story justice, whereas an obsessed blogger has no space restraints (and possibly fewer time restraints as well). Secondly and more importantly, \"unbiased\" newspaper and TV reporters are limited in their ability to connect the dots, because doing so requires expressing a length opinion about what are the most plausible answers to the various unanswered questions. Such speculation, even if well-founded, well-sourced and logically sound, will generally be seen to violate \"objectivity\" if it's coming from the reporter's brain; it would need to come from an outside source, and unless you're going to quote that source for multiple consecutive paragraphs, you're never going to get a thorough analysis that way. So if you're getting your news about Able Danger from a newspaper (or, heaven forbid, a cable news channel), you're really getting a rather superficial look at what is going on. Today's headline might be, \"Commission denies knowing about Atta\"; tomorrow's headline might be, \"Commission admits knowing about Atta.\" But what does it all mean? All you're getting is a bunch of disconnected snapshots. \n\n\n\nBy contrast, a good blogger like Captain Ed can delve deeply into the known facts, and can speculate openly about the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns and all that. But -- if it's done right, as it is in this case -- his speculation is fully transparent, with its factual basis explained completely and its logical underpinnings outlined articulately. That means a reader with a different interpretation of the facts can look at what Ed has written and draw his own conclusions (and post it in Ed's comments, or on his own blog). Thus, a real dialogue can occur, and intelligent readers can come away with a much better grasp on the situation than from reading an incomplete newspaper report, the incompleteness of which may very well mislead by omission.\n\n\n\nNow, of course, an unintelligent or lazy reader may look at Captain Ed's blog, ignore the caveats like \"Does any of this constitute proof? No,\" and conclude something unwarranted like, \"This Able Danger thing PROVES that Saddam attacked us on 9/11!\" But that's not a strike against Captain Ed, or against blogs generally -- it's a strike against unintelligent, lazy readers, who could and would jump to similarly unjustified conclusions from reading the paper or watching TV. \n\n\n\nLikewise, coverage by an unintelligent or lazy blogger, or one who is not merely biased (which we all are), but is so biased that it hampers his/her ability to think rationally, will also be unhelpful and perhaps even harmful to a full understanding of the issue. But the same can be said of lazy journalists, and I would contend that the informal meritocracy which allows good blogs to gain wide audiences (i.e., prominent bloggers link those who say good/interesting things; readers stick around if the blog stays good/interesting, go elsewhere if it doesn't) generally works better than the formalized attempts at meritocracy in many journalistic institutions (the system that, for example, made Jayson Blair a big-name reporter, and that to this day keeps letting the utterly pedestrian Maureen Dowd write weekly columns for the nation's most prominent newspaper).\n\n\n\nOf course, bloggers generally rely on others -- specifically, the mainstream journalists we love to bash :) -- to do the actual reporting. (Well, unless the reporting involves some form of Internet research -- which, incidentally, is a rich reporting tool that mainstream journalists often fail to use as productively as they should, and bloggers often pick up the slack here.) But that's fine. The blogosphere need not replace the mainstream media in order to be recognized as serving a thoroughly worthwhile purpose. We supplement the MSM. They're better at the reporting, but we are often better at the analysis -- which, in a story like this, is at least as important as the reporting. \n\n Captain's Quarters Blog has some truly excellent coverage of the ongoing, snowballing debacle surrounding the 9/11 Commission and Able Danger, the military-intelligence operation that identified Mohammad Atta and his New York-based terror cell in 2000. Much remains obscured in the Fog of War (or is it the Fog of Bureaucracy?), but one thing is now perfectly clear: Lee Hamilton and other members of the 9/11 Commission were extremely deceptive at best, and out-and-out lied at worst, when initially asked whether they were briefed about Able Danger. Their story has changed so many times in the last few days, I simply cannot think of any innocent explanation for it. Captain Ed provides a succinct summary:If you have a half-hour or so to bring yourself up to speed on something that's really quite important, I highly recommend the Captain's Quarters coverage . All relevant posts are on the linked page, although reading 'em in the proper sequence is a bit annoying, as you have to scroll down to the bottom and then keep scrolling up and down and up again. But it's worth it.The bottom line is that \"it looks like the Commission decided early to pin blame on the intelligence community rather than the bureaucracy which stripped it of its ability to act in the interests of our security.\" Potential leads which did not fit into that preconceived story line were summarily dismissed or, at the very least, not investigated as thoroughly as they should have been. As Ed writes , \"Instead of saying to themselves, 'Hey, wait a minute -- this changes the picture substantially,' and postponing the report until they could look further into Able Danger, they simply shrugged their shoulders and published what they had.\"That statement from Hamilton has since been shown to be a sly Clintonesque deception at best (does a uniformed military-intelligence officer's report count as \"U.S. government knowledge\"?), and an outright lie at worst. Like so many cornered politicians before them, Hamilton and other members of the Commission are engaging in an unseemly bit of flip-flopping with regard to theof what happened. That is intolerable, and the 9/11 Commission Report is now officially damaged goods. Nothing from that Commission has a shred of credibility until we get to the bottom of this. As Captain Ed asks , \"What else got left out because of inconvenience?\"The Able Danger fiasco raises all sorts of questions -- some of which relate to Iraq -- which we perhaps thought were answered, but which now clearly merit at least a second look, since the \"historical record\" on which we've been relying is obiovusly deeply flawed. I'm inclined to agree with Captain Ed when he says : \"We need to start rethinking this from the beginning, dump the preconceived notions, and gatherof the evidence together to understand what really happened to us on 9/11.\" And also : \"Until we have officials with some accountability look into the evidence instead of a panel comprised of people like [former Clinton official Jamie] Gorelick [who allegedly played a major role in constructing the bureaucratic 'wall' which prevented intelligence-sharing] who have axes to grind and actions to minimize, we will never get a clear, factual look at the performance of our intelligence services and the constraints put on them by bureaucrats more interested in political correctness than in national security.\"This is really an excellent example of the useful function which the blogosphere -- at its best -- can perform.

shortages bodman said the administration will do everything we can do to get fuel available to the rest of the country of tapping the spr bodman said technically its called an exchange of oil that we deliver today and that we will get oil back plus some interest if you will in the future we will be tapping that today interviewed on the fox news fox and friends first bodman was asked if price

appears to be gone what is usually a continuous line of dunes is now just marshy outcrops said ann tihansky a hydrologist with the survey its unbelievable she said after reviewing the results of an aerial video survey it just makes the coastline more and more susceptible because more of that storm surge can move further inland said glenn guntenspergen a us geological survey landscape ecologist who has studied the effect of hurricanes on gulf coast ecosystems with the loss of the islands and wetlands that buffer the region he said it becomes less and less likely for the systems to be able to recover from these kinds of storms the systems as a whole are rapidly losing their ability to recover along with the sewage in the floodwater is a witches brew of chemicals from a variety of sources including leaking fuels and oils from gas stations and submerged cars paints and solvents from small businesses and household cleaners and pesticides from peoples homes but the biggest chemical plants and refineries to the south and east of the city were spared a direct hit by the hurricane if that had happened breaches in large tanks and other industrial facilities might have spewed heavy petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorine gas from the perspective of chemical or environmental contamination it could have been much worse one advantage is that we have so much water in the city and that dilutes out the chemicals pardue said people shouldnt have an irrational fear of chemicals in the water im more concerned about the viral and bacterial things theres going to be a lot of gastrointestinal and public health issues besides the broken sewage systems polluting the floodwaters breached drinking water systems are no longer functioning sam coleman a regional director for epas

september 2 2005 by andrew gray the world has watched amazed as the planets only superpower struggles with the aftermath of hurricane katrina with some saying the chaos has exposed flaws and deep divisions in american society world leaders and ordinary citizens have expressed sympathy with the people of the southern united states whose lives were devastated by the hurricane and the flooding that followed but many have also been shocked by the images of disorder beamed around the world looters roaming the debrisstrewn streets and thousands of people gathered in new orleans waiting for the authorities to provide food water and other aid anarchy in the usa declared britains bestselling newspaper the sun apocalypse now headlined germanys handelsblatt daily the pictures of the catastrophe which has killed hundreds and possibly thousands have evoked memories of crises in the worlds poorest nations such as last years tsunami in asia which left more than 230000 people dead or missing but some view the response to those disasters more favorably than the lawless aftermath of hurricane katrina i am absolutely disgusted after the tsunami our people even the ones who lost everything wanted to help the others who were suffering said sajeewa chinthaka 36 as he watched a cricket match in colombo sri lanka not a single tourist caught in the tsunami was mugged now with all this happening in the us we can easily see where the civilized part of the worlds population is sinking into anarchy many newspapers highlighted criticism of local and state authorities and of president bush some compared the sputtering relief effort with the massive amounts of money and resources poured into the war in iraq a modern metropolis sinking in water and into anarchy it is a really cruel spectacle

multinational firm in south korea said it may have been no accident the us was hit maybe it was punishment for what it did to iraq which has a manmade disaster not a natural disaster said the woman

were overwhelmingly african americans too poor to flee the region as the hurricane loomed unlike some of their white neighbors new orleans ranks fifth in the united states in terms of african american population and 67 percent of the citys residents are black in one of the poorest states in the country where black people earn half as much as white people this has taken on a racial dimension said a report in britains guardian daily luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn in a veiled criticism of us political thought said the disaster showed the need for a strong state that could help poor people you see in this example that even in the 21st century you need the state a good functioning state and i hope that for all these people these poor people that the americans will do their best he told reporters at a european union meeting in newport wales david fordham 33 a hospital anesthetist speaking at a london underground rail station said he had spent time in america and was not

water and boxes of mres meals ready to eat people pushed people yelled the old folks and kids grabbed what they could the young men made out best though some were willing to share their bounty others just kept what they had claimed and shouldered their way through the crowd claudia sims 54 watched from the side her six grandkids all around her they hadnt eaten in 24 hours i cant compete with these people she said one of her little granddaughters waded into the throng and came back with a smile on her face grandma i got food in her tiny hand was her bounty a single mre three minutes after landing the copter lifted off and rose into the air i have seen such scenes before but always on television and always from faraway places in third world nations but not here as i watched the copter go i thought to myself can this really be happening in america end radio host no doubt end times here world net daily september 2 2005 a national talkradio host believes the severity of hurricane katrina is clear evidence that civilization is now in the end times described in the bible i dont think theres any doubt george noory said this morning on his coast to coast am program i think were in it i really do while noory explained he did not mean an imminent end to all life on earth he referred to the book of revelation in the new testament saying current events are the beginning of the end i can not imagine the grief and the horror that the people in mississippi alabama and louisiana are undergoing noory said i see it i hear it but you know what unless it happens to you it really doesnt affect you in this particular case eventually its going to affect everybody in the united states in some form or fashion and as you see the price of oil going up as you see shortages as you see the price at the grocery store going up youre going to realize just how serious a tragedy this really is its time to rethink the priorities of this country first and foremost and i always have in this strange mind i have i always wonder why did this have to happen now think about that for a moment if you believe that there are no coincidences why would this happen i mean why would divine providence want this to happen to us now katrinas storm surge and flooding have some recollecting the postchristmas tsunami which killed 200000 people and left up to 5 million in need of basic services in a dozen indian ocean nations at that time some people reflected on the endtime warning from the gospel of luke where jesus stated and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring luke 2125 noory was joined on the program by former nasa consultant richard c hoagland who called the flooding situation of new orleans a nightmare and a disaster waiting to happen this is such a biblicalproportion catastrophe hoagland said what i am appalled by is the lack of forethought and preplanning to save people from the inevitable it doesnt take a rocket scientist to know that someday this city sitting in a bowl would have this happen to it with catastrophic consequences regarding efforts to lower the water level in the big easy hoagland said it is like trying to bail out the atlantic ocean with not even a teacup but a toothpick end did new orleans catastrophe have to happen timespicayune had repeatedly raised federal spending issues editor publisher august 30 2005 by will bunch philadelphia even though hurricane katrina has moved well north of the city the waters may still keep rising in new orleans late on tuesday thats because lake pontchartrain continues to pour through a twoblocklong break in the main levee near the citys 17th street canal with much of the crescent city some 10 feet below sea level the rising tide may not stop until its level with the massive lake new orleans had long known it was highly vulnerable to flooding and a direct hit from a hurricane in fact the federal government has been working with state and local officials in the region since the late 1960s on major hurricane and flood relief efforts when flooding from a massive rainstorm in may 1995 killed six people congress authorized the southeast louisiana urban flood control project or sela over the next 10 years the army corps of engineers tasked with carrying out sela spent 430 million on shoring up levees and building pumping stations with 50 million in local aid but at least 250 million in crucial projects remained even as hurricane activity in the atlantic basin increased dramatically and the levees surrounding new orleans continued to subside yet after 2003 the flow of federal dollars toward sela dropped to a trickle the corps never tried to hide the fact that the spending pressures of the war in iraq as well as homeland security coming at the same time as federal tax cuts was the reason for the strain at least nine articles in the timespicayune from 2004 and 2005 specifically cite the cost of iraq as a reason for the lack of hurricane and floodcontrol dollars newhouse news service in an article posted late tuesday night at the timespicayune web site reported no one can say they didnt see it coming now in the wake of one of the worst storms ever serious questions are being asked about the lack of preparation in early 2004 as the cost of the conflict in iraq soared president bush proposed spending less than 20 percent of what the corps said was needed for lake pontchartrain according to a feb 16 2004 article in new orleans citybusiness on june 8 2004 walter maestri emergency management chief for jefferson parish louisiana told the timespicayune it appears that the money has been moved in the presidents budget to handle homeland security and the war in iraq and i suppose thats the price we pay nobody locally is happy that the levees cant be finished and we are doing everything we can to make the case that this is a security issue for us also that june with the 2004 hurricane season starting the corps project manager al naomi went before a local agency the east jefferson levee authority and essentially begged for 2 million for urgent work that washington was now unable to pay for from the june 18 2004 timespicayune the system is in great shape but the levees are sinking everything is sinking and if we dont get the money fast enough to raise them then we cant stay ahead of the settlement he said the problem that we have isnt that the levee is low but that the federal funds have dried up so that we cant raise them the panel authorized that money and on july 1 2004 it had to pony up another 250000 when it learned that stretches of the levee in metairie had sunk by four feet the agency had to pay for the work with higher property taxes the levee board noted in october 2004 that the feds were also now not paying for a hopedfor 15 million project to better shore up the banks of lake pontchartrain the 2004 hurricane season was the worst in decades in spite of that the federal government came back this spring with the steepest reduction in hurricane and floodcontrol funding for new orleans in history because of the proposed cuts the corps office there imposed a hiring freeze officials said that money targeted for the sela project 104 million down from 365 million was not enough to start any new jobs there was at the same time a growing recognition that more research was needed to see what new orleans must do to protect itself from a category 4 or 5 hurricane but once again the money was not there as the timespicayune reported last sept 22 that second study would take about four years to complete and would cost about 4 million said army corps of engineers project manager al naomi about 300000 in federal money was proposed for the 2005 fiscalyear budget and the state had agreed to match that amount but the cost of the iraq war forced the bush administration to order the new orleans district office not to begin any new studies and the 2005 budget no longer includes the needed money he said the senate was seeking to restore some of the sela funding cuts for 2006 but now its too late one project that a contractor had been racing to finish this summer a bridge and levee job right at the 17th street canal site of the main breach on monday the newhouse news service article published tuesday night observed the louisiana congressional delegation urged congress earlier this year to dedicate a stream of federal money to louisianas coast only to be opposed by the white house in its budget the bush administration proposed a significant reduction in funding for southeast louisianas chief hurricane protection project bush proposed 104 million a sixth of what local officials say they need local officials are now saying the article reported that had washington heeded their warnings about the dire need for hurricane protection including building up levees and repairing barrier islands the damage might not have been nearly as bad as it turned out to be end comment from webmaster of jesusissaviorcom its sickening that the us government has already spent hundredsofbillions with a big b of american taxpayer dollars on the illegal iraqi invasion but up until now refused to spend the small amount of chump change required 60 million to protect the american citizens living on the southeastern coast something is very very wrong in washington we need to stand up against the bush administrations raping of the american taxpayer the same is true of the democrats as well their all in bed together they are stealing our money to accomplish their own agendas the iraqi conflict has absolutely nothing to do with freedom americas roe return on equity is pathetic what do american taxpayers have to show for all their hardearned tax dollars thousands of dead bodies floating in mississippi and louisiana new world orleans americans are being

            "text": "NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of New Orleans residents fled inland on Sunday as Hurricane Katrina strengthened into one of the fiercest U.S. storms ever seen and barreled toward the low-lying Gulf Coast city. With Katrina expected to hit around sunrise on Monday, Highways out of Louisiana's largest city, much of which lies below sea level, were jammed and gasoline stations and convenience stores reported long lines for water and other supplies after city officials ordered 485,000 people to leave. Mayor Ray Nagin warned the hurricane's storm surge of up to 28 feet could topple levees and flood the city's historic French Quarter when it makes a second, and more powerful, assault on U.S. shores after killing seven people in Florida on Thursday. \"Ladies and gentlemen, I wish I had better news for you but we are facing a storm that most of us have feared,\" Nagin told a news conference after reading out a mandatory evacuation order. \"This is a threat that we've never faced before.\" In the French Quarter, shopkeepers sandbagged art galleries and boarded up bars and restaurants in preparation for the storm. Police and fire officials took to the streets with bullhorns, alerting residents of the coming danger. Those who could not join the exodus were advised to head to about a dozen shelters in the city, one of which is the Louisiana Superdome, home to the National Football League's New Orleans Saints. Max Mayfield, director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center, described Katrina as a \"perfect\" hurricane. It had grown into a Category 5 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson, with winds near 165 mph (270 kph) just before 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) on Sunday, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Katrina was about 150 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River and heading northwest at 13 mph (21 kph). Hurricane force winds could be felt 105 miles out from the center. Katrina had a central pressure -- a measure of a storm's intensity -- of 902 millibars, which would make it one of the four strongest storms on record. The Labor Day hurricane of 1935 that hit the Florida Keys, killing some 600 people, was the strongest with a minimum central pressure of 892 millibars on landfall. \"The lower the pressure, the stronger the winds and that is exactly what is happening here with Katrina,\" Mayfield told The hurricane center warned of destructive winds along the Gulf Coast from the Florida-Alabama border, through Mississippi and west into Louisiana, and said Katrina could bring up to 15 inches of rain. Its track would take it through key U.S. oil and gas areas in the Gulf of Mexico, and Katrina seemed likely to affect already sky-high gasoline prices. Oil rigs were evacuated and casinos along Mississippi's coast were closed. It also endangers the port serving New Orleans, one of the most important in the world, and could do billions in damage to the city's tourism infrastructure. Tourists on the Gulf Coast scrambled to join the mass exodus but many were left trapped as rental cars were snapped up quickly. Authorities in New Orleans said they would commandeer vehicles and private buildings if necessary. \"About all you can do at this point is pack the car with as much as you can carry, place the rest of your belongings as high in the house as you can and then get the heck out of here,\" said Cathe Jackson, whose house is one block from the water in Biloxi, a casino-resort town on Mississippi's coast. President Bush declared an emergency in Louisiana and Mississippi and a major disaster in Florida, measures that allow federal aid to be deployed. \"We will do everything in our power to help the people and communities affected by this storm,\" Bush said from his ranch in Crawford, Texas. \"We cannot stress enough the danger this hurricane poses to Gulf Coast communities.\" The last Category 5 to strike the area was Hurricane Camille in 1969. Camille, which just missed New Orleans but devastated parts of Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama, killing more than 250 people. Hurricane Andrew, which destroyed the city of Homestead south of Miami in 1992 and ranks as the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history, also was a Category 5.\n\nHurricane Katrina pummeled the Mississippi Gulf Coast with winds as high as 140 mph before weakening as it moved across the state and toward Tennessee. New Orleans was spared a direct hit. The center of Katrina, now a Category 1 storm with winds of 75 mph, was about 30 miles (51 kilometers) northwest of Laurel, Mississippi, moving to the north at about 18 mph (29 kph), according to the National Hurricane Center at 4 p.m. local time. The storm, which pushed oil prices to a record, knocked out power to hundreds of thousands along the Gulf Coast. Katrina moved through southern Mississippi on a path that will bring the storm into western Tennessee by tomorrow. The storm's surge caused flooding, trapped people in buildings and caused an unspecified amount of damage, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour said today. ``This is the worst that's hit the New Orleans and Gulf area probably since Camille,'' Major Dalton Cunningham, Salvation Army Divisional Commander for Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, said in an interview from Jackson, Mississippi. Camille killed 256 people when it hit the Gulf region in 1969. An earlier projected path had Katrina directly striking New Orleans, some of which lies 20 feet below sea level. Officials and area residents -- millions of whom fled for higher ground -- had been concerned the storm would cause flooding that would overwhelm the city's system of levees and pumps. Katrina lashed the city with winds as high as 135 mph. ``It looks like a war zone, with tree branches down everywhere,'' John Hazard, 44, said today from the uptown New Orleans home of his brother-in-law Bill Hines. The projected three-day path for the storm shows it crossing into Kentucky by 1 p.m. tomorrow and into the Great Lakes region a day later. Areas of Harrison and Hancock counties, on the Gulf Coast, are under water, Barbour said. Water was reported as high as the second floor of the Beau Rivage Hotel and Casino in Biloxi, the Sun-Herald reported on its Web site. There are no casualty or property damage estimates yet and officials can't go rescue people trapped until the winds die down, Barbour said. New Orleans, just 100 miles upriver from the Gulf of Mexico, has 500,000 residents within a metropolitan area of 1.3 million people, and depends on pumps and levees to keep dry. The hurricane center warned of storm-surge flooding in Louisiana of as much as 28 feet. About 10,000 people sought shelter inside the Superdome football stadium in New Orleans, Louisiana State Police spokesman Kevin Cowan said in a telephone interview from Baton Rouge. The storm blew off two parts of the stadium's roof, each of about 2 feet by 6 feet, Social Services Department spokesman Irby Hornsby said. ``The structure of the roof is still there, it's probably just the stuff covering the structure that's peeled away,'' Hornsby said. ``I just hope that this is the worst of it.'' Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco, a Democrat, said county emergency coordinators have determined there are no structural problems with the roof. Buildings collapsed in New Orleans and five floors of windows blew out of Charity hospital in the city, the Times- Picayune reported on its Web site. There is ``widespread'' flooding in Bernard and Plaquemines parishes, said Sergeant Kathy Flinchman, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Police Emergency Operations center in Baton Rouge. ``Katrina is by no means over,'' Blanco said in a press conference. ``Stay safe. It's too dangerous to come home. The roads are flooded. The power is out. The phones are down and there is no food or water.'' Storm surges were estimated to be as high as 15 feet to 18 feet near New Orleans and 10 feet to 15 feet in Gulfport, Mississippi, Sisko said. As much as 12 inches of rain fell in southeastern Louisiana, he said. ``Now you're getting the reports about people who are stranded in parts of the cities, certain buildings that are collapsing, breaches in one part of our levee system, so it's just gathering all the information now and trying to make an assessment,'' U.S. Representative William Jefferson, a Democrat who represents New Orleans, said in a televised interview. Entergy Corp. and Southern Co., owners of electric utilities along the Gulf Coast, said almost 1.1 million customers from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle were without power today. As of 11:30 a.m. Central time, 742,500 customers in Louisiana lacked power, said David Caplan, spokesman for New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. Another 52,600 customers were without power along the Mississippi coast, he said. Atlanta-based Southern had 188,264 customers without power at its Alabama Power unit -- mostly in Mobile -- at noon, according to spokeswoman Betsy Shearron. Another 82,509 customers in the Florida Panhandle lacked electric service, said John Hutchinson, a spokesman for Southern's Gulf Power unit based in Pensacola. BellSouth Corp., the largest provider of local-telephone lines in nine southeastern states, said it lost 72,972 local- telephone lines after Katrina. BellSouth, the No. 3 U.S. local telephone provider, expects significant network damage along the Gulf coast of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, BellSouth spokeswoman Nadine Randall said in an e-mail statement today. Katrina may rival the 1994 Northridge earthquake as the third most costly U.S. catastrophe, according to preliminary forecasts of insured losses. The storm's estimated cost for insurers such as Allstate Corp. will probably be $9 billion to $16 billion, said Eqecat Inc., a storm modeler. Eqecat cut its estimate from as high as $30 billion as Katrina veered east of New Orleans, sparing the city a direct hit. ``People are breathing a sigh of relief that the storm has lost strength and that New Orleans appeared to be on the weak side of the storm,'' said Ray Stone, vice president of catastrophe operations at St. Paul Travelers Cos., the second- largest U.S. commercial insurer. President George W. Bush today declared parts of Mississippi a major disaster area. He signed an emergency declaration for Louisiana yesterday, freeing up federal disaster aid. Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Michael Brown said Bush will sign a disaster declaration for the region affected by Katrina, which will give FEMA the authority to help Louisiana recover from the storm. Crude oil for October delivery rose $1.12, or 1.7 percent, to $67.25 a barrel at the 2:30 p.m. close of floor trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Earlier oil jumped as high as $70.80 a barrel, the biggest increase in 29 months. Natural gas, heating oil and gasoline climbed to all-time highs as well. Investors are concerned Katrina will rupture pipelines, rip rigs from their moorings and disrupt production for weeks. Hurricane Ivan last September cut the region's oil output by as much as 80 percent. The storm shut 1.4 million barrels of daily oil output, or 92 percent of normal Gulf production, according to today's report from the Minerals Management Service in Washington. It shut 8.3 billion cubic feet a day of gas production, or 83 percent of the total amount of gas produced in the Gulf. Photo Left: 28 August 2005 2310Z ¬†¬† A beautiful satellite presentation of the eye while below winds roar at 155mph! White House spokesman Scott McClellan said today that Bush is prepared to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the U.S.'s emergency oil stockpile, to assist energy producers and refiners in the path of Katrina. Transocean Inc., the world's largest offshore oil and natural-gas driller, said its semi-submersible Deepwater Nautilus rig broke free from its moorings in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Katrina. Alabama officials today closed a bridge that spans the Mobile River after it was hit by a oil drilling platform that broke away from its moorings. Disruptions to Gulf natural-gas production are being felt as far away as Detroit and New York state after El Paso Corp. and NiSource warned power plant operators, manufacturers and gas utilities to curtail gas consumption because of shortfalls in Gulf supplies. The storm damaged some roofs of buildings at Lockheed Martin Corp.'s Michoud facility in New Orleans, where the company assembles the external fuel tanks for space shuttles, spokesman Evan McCollum said in a telephone interview from the company's space operations headquarters in Colorado. Moody's Investors Service said today it placed the ratings of Premier Entertainment Biloxi LLC on review for a possible cut because of the effect Katrina likely will have on the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Biloxi, the company's only casino asset, which is scheduled to open in the third quarter. The Salvation Army can feed 400,000 people in Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama, Cunningham said. The organization has 72 food trucks and two 54-foot mobile kitchens that can serve 20,000 meals a day, he said. The Salvation Army will direct the kitchens where the Federal Emergency Management Agency says they must go, he said. Katrina was earlier a maximum Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with winds as high as 175 mph. It would have been the most powerful hurricane heading for the U.S. since 1992's Andrew, which hit south Florida. The storm swept through southern Florida last week as a minimal hurricane, killing at least nine people and cutting power to more than a million homes. Tracy Watson, a botanist who lives in New Orleans, left the city yesterday to stay with friends in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The trip that normally takes her 11 hours took her 15, she said. Before leaving, Watson said she spent about three hours boarding up windows in her greenhouse to protect more than 100 plants and flowers, some of which she uses in her work. ``It's my garden and greenhouse I'm most worried about,'' Watson said in an interview. ``I have thousands of dollars in plant life back there. I've brought as much with me as I could but really, it could never be enough. Now I just wait, and hope.''\n\nMARTIAL LAW DECLARED: Situation Deteriorating New Orleans, LA (CBS) - Martial Law has been declared in New Orleans as conditions continued to deteriorate. Water levels in The Big Easy and it's suburbs are rising at dangerous levels and officials stated they don't know where the water is coming from. Residents are being urged to get out of New Orleans in any way they can as officials fear \"life will be unsustainable\" for days or even weeks. Gulf Coast residents were staggered by the body-blow inflicted by Hurricane Katrina, with more than a million people sweltering without power, miles of lowlands under water and unconfirmed reports of as many 80 people dead in Mississippi alone. \"We heard one report of 30 dead at just one apartment complex on the beach in Biloxi,\" said CBS News Correspondent Jim Acosta. Much of the devastation is being blamed on a storm surge. \"It's not like when you see big tornadoes or hurricane force winds come through and the house is blown away,\" said Acosta. \"A storm surge rises up to the house and clears out everything in its path, moving furniture and cars around.\" The Ohio Valley could see severe flooding from Katrina Tuesday. \"Katrina is now moving to the north,\" said CBS News Hurricane Analyst Bryan Norcross. \"It is a tropical storm now moving into Tennessee. But the big rain event today is going to be in the Ohio Valley, all the way from Missouri on up to Louisville towards Cincinnati and then it will spread through the northeast.\" Even with Katrina swirling away to the north, two different levee breaches in New Orleans sent a churning sea of water coursing through city streets. Col. Rich Wagenaar of the Army Corps of Engineers, said a breach in the eastern part of the city was causing flooding and \"significant evacuations\" in Orleans and St. Bernard parishes. He did not know how many people were affected by the flooding. Authorities also were gathering information on a levee breach in the western part of New Orleans. Jason Binet, of the Army Corps of Engineers, said that breach began Monday afternoon and may have grown overnight. Emergency personnel faced flooding problems of their own. \"We had a 30-foot rise from the bay, which came into the building, about 12-foot high,\" Capt. Houston Dorr of the Mississippi Highway Patrol, based in Biloxi, said on CBS News' The Early Show. \"It never got to the second floor but we were on our way up to the third floor if it came in higher.\" Dorr told co-anchor Harry Smith the patrol did what it could, despite its own problems. \"The water downed trees, houses moved. We were mostly worried at the time who we could rescue, so many people were trapped in their houses, but it was just total devastation,\" Dorr said. \"It's bad,\" agreed Federal Emergency Management Agency director Mike Brown. \"This storm is really having a catastrophic effect throughout the South.\" Brown cautioned the emergency won't end once the waters recede. \"We will find a lot of structural damage in those homes, disease from animal carcasses, the chemicals in homes, that sort of thing,\" he told Early Show co-anchor Julie Chen. \"It's going to take a long time to clean up and make it safe for people to get back to their neighborhoods.\" The federal government began rushing baby formula, communications equipment, generators, water and ice into hard-hit areas of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, along with doctors, nurses and first-aid supplies. The Pentagon sent experts to help with search-and-rescue operations. \"This is our tsunami,\" Biloxi Mayor A.J. Holloway told the Biloxi Sun Herald.\n\n Katrina knocked out power to more than a million people from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle, and authorities said it could be two months before electricity is restored to everyone. Ten major hospitals in New Orleans were running on emergency backup power. \"It will be unsafe to return to the coastal area for several days,\" Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour told evacuees Monday. \"Be patient. Don't be in a hurry to go back.\" According to preliminary assessments by AIR Worldwide Corp., a risk modeling firm, the property and casualty insurance industry faces as much as $26 billion in claims from Katrina. That would make Katrina more expensive than the previous record-setting storm, Hurricane Andrew, which caused some $21 billion in insured losses in 1992 to property in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. Mississippi's economy was also dealt a blow that could run into the millions, as the storm shuttered the flashy casinos that dot its coast. The gambling houses are built on barges anchored just off the beach, and Barbour said emergency officials had received reports of water reaching the third floors of some casinos. After striking the Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane, Katrina was later downgraded to a tropical storm as it passed through eastern Mississippi, moving north at 21 mph. Winds early Tuesday were still a dangerous 60 mph. At New Orleans' Superdome, where power was lost early Monday, and holes opened in the roof a few hours later, some 9,000 refugees spent a second night in the dark bleachers. With the air conditioning off, the carpets were soggy, the bricks were slick with humidity and anxiety was rising. \"Everybody wants to go see their house. We want to know what's happened to us. It's hot, it's miserable and, on top of that, you're worried about your house,\" said Rosetta Junne, 37. A 50-foot water main broke in New Orleans, making it unsafe to drink the city's water without first boiling it. And police made several arrests for looting. In a particularly low-lying neighborhood on the south shore of Louisiana's Lake Pontchartrain, a levee along a canal gave way and forced dozens of residents to flee or scramble to the roofs when water rose to their gutters. \"I've never encountered anything like it in my life. It just kept rising and rising and rising,\" said Bryan Vernon, who spent three hours on his roof, screaming over howling winds for someone to save him and his fiancÔøΩe. \"Let me tell you something, folks. I've been out there. It's complete devastation,\" Gulfport Fire Chief Pat Sullivan said Monday. He estimated that 75 percent of buildings in Gulfport have major roof damage, \"if they have a roof left at all.\" In Mobile, Ala., the storm knocked an oil rig free from its moorings, wedging it under a bridge. Muddy six-foot waves crashed into the eastern shore of Mobile Bay, flooding stately, antebellum mansions and littering them with oak branches. \"There are lots of homes through here worth a million dollars. At least they were yesterday,\" said a shirtless Fred Wright. \"I've been here 25 years, and this is the worst I've ever seen the water.\" Helicopters dropped sandbags on two broken levees as the water kept rising in the streets. The governor drew up plans to evacuate just about everyone left in town. Looters ransacked stores. Doctors in their scrubs had to use canoes to bring supplies to blacked-out hospitals. New Orleans sank deeper into crisis Tuesday, a full day after Hurricane Katrina hit. \"It's downtown Baghdad,\" said tourist Denise Bollinger, who snapped pictures of looting in the French Quarter. \"It's insane.\" The mayor estimated that 80 percent of New Orleans was flooded, while a countless number of residents were still stranded on rooftops. Hospitals were running out of power and scrambling to find places to take their patients. At one clinic, broken glass littered some areas and patients and staff had fallen on floors slick with floodwaters. \"It's like being in a Third World country,\" said Mitch Handrich, a registered nurse manager at Charity Hospital, where nurses were ventilating patients by hand after the power and then the backup generator failed. Some 300 patients had yet to be evacuated, but the babies in intensive care had been flown out. \"We're just trying to stay alive,\" Handrich said. Gov. Kathleen Blanco said that everyone still in the city, now huddled in the Superdome and other rescue centers, needs to leave. She said late Tuesday she wanted the Superdome _ with no electricity or air conditioning _ to be evacuated within two days. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is considering putting people on cruise ships, in tent cities, mobile home parks, and so-called floating dormitories _ boats the agency uses to house its own employees. Rescue teams were still picking up people throughout the city Tuesday, leaving them on island-like highway overpasses and on a levee to wait to be moved again. Eventually, they will end up in the Superdome, where 15,000 to 20,000 people have taken refuge, said Louisiana National Guard Maj. Gen. Bennett C. Landreneau. One person died at the Superdome attempting to jump from one level to a lower one. Among the evacuees are 5,000 inmates from New Orleans and suburbs that need to be moved. Officials were trying to figure out how. The historic French Quarter appeared to have been spared the worst flooding, but its stores were getting the worst of human nature. \"The looting is out of control. The French Quarter has been attacked,\" Councilwoman Jackie Clarkson said. \"We're using exhausted, scarce police to control looting when they should be used for search and rescue while we still have people on rooftops.\" As Sen. Mary Landrieu flew over the area by helicopter, a group of people smashed a window at a convenience store and jumped in. At a drug store in the French Quarter, people were running out with grocery baskets and coolers full of soft drinks, chips and diapers. One looter shot and wounded a fellow looter, who was taken to a hospital and survived. Only rooftops were visible in several neighborhoods and the occasional building was in flames. On a grassy hill in the Carrolton neighborhood, a group of people watched the water quickly rising in the street, about a foot an hour by some estimates. William Washington had gone to bed in dry house Monday night, well after the hurricane had passed. The water came up Tuesday after the levee broke, and by afternoon his home was flooded. \"We're trying to get to the Superdome,\" Washington said as he waited with neighbors. \"We're waiting for the National Guard. The radio mentioned that they would pick people up.\" With hundreds, if not thousands, of people still stranded in flooded homes, attics and rooftops across the city, rescue boats were bypassing the dead to reach the living, Mayor C. Ray Nagin said. \"We're not even dealing with dead bodies,\" Nagin said. \"They're just pushing them on the side.\" A few more feet of water could wipe out the entire city water system, said Terry Ebbert, the city's homeland security chief. The intestates are impassable, the bridges may be unstable and no one knows if the buildings can withstand the damage brought by Katrina, the governor said after flying over the region. \"We saw block after block, neighborhood and neighborhood inundated,\" Blanco said, her voice breaking with emotion. \"It's just heartbreaking.\" Sean Jeffries of New Orleans had already been evacuated from one French Quarter hotel when he was ordered out of a second hotel Tuesday because of rising water. The 37-year-old banker _ who admitted to looting some food from a nearby supermarket _ said the hotel guests were told they were being taken to a convention center, but from there, they didn't know. \"We're in the middle of a national tragedy,\" he said as he popped purloined grapes in his mouth. \"But I know this city. We will be back. It may take awhile. But we will be back.\" Federal officials declared a public health emergency for the entire Gulf Coast Wednesday, calling life in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina \"very dangerous.\" They rushed food, medicine and water to the victims as part of a wide-ranging government rescue-and-relief response. Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt said his agency is concerned about potential disease outbreaks and was sending medical experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He urged residents of the coastal area to boil water and follow food safety precautions as well as to avoid situations that might lead to carbon monoxide poisoning from electricity generators. He also said that mental health personnel were being sent to the area. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said: \"The situation in all affected areas remains very dangerous.\" Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said his agency is working to restore highways, airports, seaports and oil pipelines in the region. And he said generators are being moved to pipeline pumping stations to restore the flow of oil to the region. Environmental Protection Agency director Stephen Johnson said anti- pollution standards for gasoline are being eased throughout the country until Sept. 15, a step expected to ease shortages of the fuel. More than 2.7 million electricity customers were still without power on Tuesday after Hurricane Katrina pummeled the U.S. Gulf Coast and moved into the Tennessee Valley. Katrina crashed into southern Louisiana as a Category 4 storm Monday morning with maximum sustained winds near 140 mph. The remnants of the storm are located over the Ohio Valley. Entergy Corp., with 1.1 million customers without power in Louisiana and Mississippi, warned customers to expect a long and difficult restoration that could take weeks. Some government officials in Louisiana and Mississippi said it could take a month or more to restore full electric service in some of the hardest hit areas. To avoid damaging equipment, Entergy shut at least two power plants on the Mississippi River near New Orleans, including the 1,089-megawatt Waterford 3 nuclear reactor and the 825 MW Michoud natural gas and oil-fired station, and started to shut the 1,263 MW Grand Gulf unit in Mississippi. The company stopped reducing power at Grand Gulf as the hurricane-force winds veered away from the site. One MW powers about 800 homes, according to North American averages. Southern Co., which restored power to more than 130,000 customers in Florida and Alabama, reported 825,000 customers were still without power across its service territory, with all 195,000 customers out in Mississippi, 551,000 still out in Alabama and 79,000 out in Florida. Cleco Corp., which serves about 265,000 customers in Louisiana, said about 80,000 customers were without service Tuesday morning. In addition to the publicly traded utilities, Katrina also left more than 239,000 customers without service at the municipal and cooperative utilities in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Energy. As Katrina pounded its way across the Tennessee Valley, the Tennessee Valley Authority reported at least eight damaged transmission lines and cut power to about 300,000 customers served by distributors of TVA power in Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia and Alabama. In Florida, FPL Group Inc.'s Florida Power and Light subsidiary restored power to nearly 1.3 million of the 1.4 million customers affected by the hurricane as Katrina crossed the southern part of the state on August 25-26. In a release, FPL Group Inc. said it expects to restore service to all customers by Friday night. Entergy's subsidiaries own and operate about 30,000 MW of generating capacity, market energy commodities and transmit and distribute power to 2.6 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Southern's subsidiaries own and operate more than 39,000 MW of generating capacity, market energy commodities, and transmit and distribute electricity to more than 4 million customers in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida. TVA owns and operates more than 31,000 MW of generating capacity, sells electricity to local distribution companies serving 8.3 million consumers in Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina and Virginia, and markets surplus power to energy companies in neighboring grids. FPL's subsidiaries own and operate more than 31,000 MW of generating capacity across the United States, market energy commodities, and transmit and distribute electricity to more than 4.3 million customers in Florida.\n\nLouisiana governor calls for evacuation of New Orleans Kathleen Blanco, governor of Louisiana, called on the city of New Orleans to evacuate as waters continued to rise. ÔøΩWe absolutely must evacuate the people in the dome and other shelters in the city,ÔøΩÔøΩ she said on CNN. ÔøΩItÔøΩs a logistical nightmare.ÔøΩ The US military on Wednesday added Navy ships, including two helicopter assault vessels and the hospital ship Comfort, and search troops to a relief effort in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. US authorities were battling to shore up heavily damaged levees in an effort to save New Orleans from almost total submersion as the city, 80 per cent of which lies below sea level, fills with water. Police are struggling to contain widespread looting and officials fear the lack of basic sanitation or fresh water will lead to disease. In Mississippi, authorities put the death toll at 100, but said they expected the number to be much higher as search and rescue operations continued. In the markets, by mid-morning in London on Wednesday, Nymex West Texas Intermediate was again creeping back towards the nominal record high of $70.85 a barrel hit on Tuesday as speculators expected US oil inventories to be squeezed. WTI for October delivery stood at $70.50 a barrel, up 69 cents from TuesdayÔøΩs close. Gasoline futures moved up more than 3 per cent to $2.57 a gallon, also a new record. The damage from Hurricane Katrina has been worse than expected, initial assessments showed on Tuesday, prompting a new rise in oil prices to record levels and raising concerns about the cost of insurance in the Gulf of Mexico. Industry sources said that one big underwriter had already stopped providing business-interruption insurance in the Gulf and others warned that rising storm losses would lead to premiums so high that insuring platforms could become uneconomic. Damage assessments on Tuesday suggested that it could take a week to restart refineries hit by the hurricane at a time when supplies already are tight. The commercial impact will continue to be assessed on Wednesday as stores and businesses struggled to clean up after the hurricane. New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin said in a television interview that about 80 per cent of the city was flooded. Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco said ÔøΩmiles and miles of homesÔøΩ were under water. ÔøΩSome neighborhoods will need total rebuilding,ÔøΩ she said. Retail stocks traded lower on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday as traders considered the cost of lost business. Wal-Mart said on Tuesday that 70 of its stores were still closed on Tuesday afternnon, down from 123 earlier in the day. Merrill Lynch said in a research note the impact on retailers was likely to be broad based as consumers trimmed spending if petrol prices rose further. ÔøΩWe do not anticipate a wholesale retrenchment, but we could see more trading down and less discretionary expenditures,ÔøΩ Merrill said. Other commodities felt the impact on Tuesday, as cotton futures settled at three-week highs after the hurricane lashed fields in Alabama and Mississippi, while coffee prices rose sharply after Katrina damaged coffee warehouses in New Orleans. There are fears that the human death toll may rise into the hundreds as search and rescue teams extend their operations on Wednesday. Haley Barbour, governor of Mississippi, said at least 80 people were feared dead in his state alone, while in New Orleans, Louisiana, bodies were seen floating in the floodwater. Local officials declared martial law in New Orleans and south-east Louisiana to assist with the relief effort. George W. Bush, president, cut short his holiday to return to Washington on Wednesday to help monitor federal efforts to help the rescue and reconstruction effort. ÔøΩWe've got a lot of work to do,ÔøΩ he said. More than 1m people between Louisiana and Florida were left without electricity and power companies said it could be two months before service was fully restored. Some companies estimated it might be a week or longer before they resumed refining operations in the area hit by the hurricane that blew through the heart of US oil country on Monday. ÔøΩIf we can put offshore production up again, but we have no refineries, the oil will be worthless,ÔøΩ said Adam Sieminski of Deutsche Bank. Initial reports point to sustained outages at several refineries in Louisiana and Mississippi. Nine refineries in the two states are shut, reducing capacity by 1.774m barrels of crude oil a day, about 9 per cent of the US's total capacity. The extent of the damage to underwater pipelines and anchoring systems was unknown but the discovery of at least two rigs that had broken their moorings indicated the probable extent of the industry's problems. Insurance companies estimate the damage from Katrina could be $26bn almost as much as the total from last year's four hurricanes in the Gulf. Oil companies have become increasingly vulnerable to hurricane losses as they move further offshore into the Gulf of Mexico. ÔøΩA lot of underwriters are reviewing their positions in that area, deciding whether they want to write the business,ÔøΩ said Tim Fillingham, who runs Aon UK's energy practice. Insurance analysts on Tuesday put the insured losses at anything between $12bn and $25bn. ÔøΩIt is likely Hurricane Katrina will be the largest insured loss from a single event since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the largest US hurricane loss since Hurricane Andrew in 1992,ÔøΩ Fitch Ratings said. Standard & PoorÔøΩs said the storm was likely to hurt third-quarter US GDP, shaving a few points off its forecast of 3.7 per cent growth. However, it noted that building and other repairs to hurricane-related damage in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana and other affected regions should boost GDP in subsequentquarters. Additional reporting by Richard Beales in New York\n\nNew Orleans shelters to be evacuated New Orleans resembled a war zone more than a modern American metropolis Tuesday, as Gulf Coast communities struggled to deal with the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Deteriorating conditions in New Orleans will force authorities to evacuate the thousands of people at city shelters, including the Louisiana Superdome, where a policeman told CNN unrest was escalating. The officer expressed concern that the situation could worsen overnight after three shootings, looting and a number of attempted carjackings during the afternoon. (See video of the looting -- 1:25) Officials could not yet provide accurate estimates for fatalities or time needed for recovery in the area and are focusing, instead, on widespread search-and-rescue operations. The death toll from the storm so far is estimated at 70 -- mostly in Mississippi. Officials stressed that the number is uncertain and likely to be much higher. (See aerial video of the aftermath -- 3:02) \"A lot of people lost their lives, and we still don't have any idea [how many], because the focus continues to be on rescuing those who have survived,\" Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco told reporters Tuesday. Elsewhere along the Gulf Coast, authorities used boats and helicopters to reach stranded residents and search for survivors. The storm ripped ashore in Louisiana on Monday morning with winds topping 140 mph before scourging Mississippi and Alabama. The U.S. Coast Guard said its crews assisted in the rescue Monday of about 1,200 people stranded by high water in the New Orleans area, and thousands more were rescued Tuesday morning.\n\n Waters rising in New Orleans New Orleans was left with no power, no drinking water, dwindling food supplies, widespread looting, smoke rising on the horizon and the sounds of gunfire. At least one large building was ablaze Tuesday. (Full story) Mayor Ray Nagin told CNN that at least 30 buildings had collapsed, but that no attempt had been made to determine a death toll. \"There are dead bodies floating in some of the water,\" Nagin said. \"The rescuers would basically push them aside as they were trying to save individuals.\" Nagin said that as of late Tuesday \"a significant amount of water\" is flowing into the bowl-shaped city and sections of the city now dry could be under 9 or 10 feet of water within hours. \"The bowl is filling up,\" he said. Frustration was also rising among people who now find themselves refugees in their own city. Thousands of people were being housed in the Louisiana Superdome, where toilets were overflowing and there was no air conditioning to provide relief from 90-degree heat. Nagin estimated the number of people in the Superdome at between 12,000 and 15,000 people as of late Tuesday. He said they could be there for a week unless evacuated sooner. Blanco said officials are making plans to evacuate people from the Superdome and other shelters, but she did not say when that might happen or where they might be taken. The city's main public hospital, Charity Hospital, was no longer functioning and was being evacuated, Blanco said. Also under way was the evacuation of more than 1,000 people from Tulane University Hospital with the help of the U.S. military, hospital spokeswoman Karen Troyer Caraway said. \"It's an unbelievable situation,\" she said. \"We're completely surrounded by water. There's looting going on in the streets around the hospital.\" Hundreds of people were looting businesses downtown, throwing rocks through store windows and hauling away goods. National Guard troops moved into the downtown business district, and state police squads backed by SWAT teams were sent in to scatter looters and restore order, authorities said late Tuesday. Nagin told Mississippi television station WAPT a police officer was shot and wounded when he surprised a looter Tuesday, but the officer was expected to recover. The biggest problem facing authorities, they said, was an inability to communicate. Nearly all of the parishes in the New Orleans area -- Orleans, St. John the Baptist, Plaquemines, St. Tammany and Jefferson -- have curfews in place. Inmates from a flooded parish jail were relocated to a freeway on-ramp, where they sat out in the sun, under the watch of armed officers. Nagin said 80 percent of the city was under water, which was 20 feet deep in some places. (See video of knee-deep and rising water in the French Quarter -- 1:19) Water from Lake Pontchartrain was pouring into the downtown area from a levee breach, rising steadily throughout the day. (Map) The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported two major breaches in the levee system that protects New Orleans, much of which lies below sea level. Authorities warned that efforts to limit the flooding have been unsuccessful, and that residents may not be able to return home for a month. \"The Corps Of Engineers has attempted to fix the situation under emergency conditions,\" Blanco told CNN. \"They're not the best conditions, and probably too little, too late.\" Getting anything into New Orleans will be difficult because of the damage to two bridge spans seven miles long that carry Interstate 10 over Lake Pontchartrain, linking the city to points east. \"This is a tragedy of great proportions, greater than any we've see in our lifetimes,\" Blanco said. \"We know many lives have been lost.\" The governor also said it was \"impossible to even begin to estimate\" how long it will take to restore power and drinking water in New Orleans.\n\n Death toll rising in Mississippi Katrina has inflicted more damage to Mississippi beach towns than did Hurricane Camille, and its death toll is likely to be higher, the state's governor said Tuesday. (Full story) Camille killed 143 people when it struck the state's coastal counties in 1969 and a total of 256 after it swept inland. \"There are structures after structures that survived Camille with minor damage that are not there any more,\" Gov. Haley Barbour told reporters in Jackson. Katrina destroyed \"every one\" of the casinos that raked in $500,000 per day in revenues to state coffers, Barbour said after a helicopter tour of the affected areas. \"There were 10- and 20-block areas where there was nothing -- not one home standing,\" he said. Barbour would not give a confirmed death toll, but said it was likely to be higher than previous reports of 50 to 80 dead. Jason Green of the Harrison County Coroner's Office said funeral homes in Gulfport had received 26 bodies since the storm passed Monday. In the small town of Bay St. Louis, search and rescue crews put paint marks on homes known to contain bodies, because there weren't enough refrigerated trucks to remove the corpses. In Biloxi, an employee of the city's Grand Casino was awed by the extent of the damage. \"I was a senior in high school when Hurricane Camille hit, in 1969, and I have never seen destruction of this magnitude,\" said Scott Richmond. Part of the city's sea wall was washed away, and nearly every downtown building had extensive damage to its first level. State emergency management officials said 80 percent of the state's residents had no power. In Biloxi, a 25-foot swell of water crashed in from the Gulf of Mexico Monday and inundated structures there. Up to 30 people are believed to have been killed when an apartment complex on the beach collapsed in the storm. Distraught resident Harvey Jackson told a local television station about losing his wife in the floodwater as they stood on their roof. (Watch the video report of a husband whose wife slipped from his grip -- 1:07 ) \"I held her hand as tight as I could and she told me, 'You can't hold me.' She said 'Take care of the kids and the grandkids,' \" he sobbed. (Victims left with nothing) Streets and homes were flooded as far as 6 miles inland from the beach, and looting was reported in Biloxi and in Gulfport, officials said.\n\n Other developments ÔøΩIn Mobile, Alabama, the storm pushed water from Mobile Bay into downtown, submerging large sections of the city, and officials imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew. (Full story) ÔøΩThe impact of Katrina on U.S. oil production and refinery capabilities may be worse than initial reports estimated and could lead to a national gas crisis in the short-term, analysts warned Tuesday. (Full story) ÔøΩPresident Bush was returning to Washington two days ahead of schedule to help oversee Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts, the White House announced. He will fly Friday to Louisiana to tour parishes ravaged by Hurricane Katrina, U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu said. (Full story) ÔøΩThe U.S. military Tuesday started to move ships and helicopters to the region at the request of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to aid in rescue and medical needs, military officials said. (Full story) ÔøΩKatrina was downgraded to a tropical depression Tuesday. As of the 11 p.m. ET update from the National Hurricane Center, the storm was pushing through the Ohio River Valley, causing flood watches in several states.\n\nPentagon sending five ships to help hurricane relief operations: report The Pentagon is sending five ships, eight maritime rescue teams, helicopters, hovercraft and relief supplies to the southern region devastated by Hurricane Katrina, The New York Times reported Wednesday. In a decision late Tuesday, the US Defense Department dispatched a Navy amphibious assault ship from Texas, while four other vessels were expected to sail from Norfolk, Virginia, within 24 hours, a spokesman for the Northern Command told the daily. The assault ship is carrying six helicopters, while the other vessels will be loaded with food, fuel, medical and construction supplies, as well as hovercraft that can be used for evacuation and search-and-rescue missions, the spokesman Mike Kucharek said. At the same time, eight 14-person civilian Swift boat rescue teams are being flown from California to Louisiana aboard Air Force C-5 cargo planes, he added. The Pentagon on Tuesday set up a special command at Camp Shelby, Mississippi to coordinate military relief operations, which will be headed by three-star Army Lieutenant General Ruseel Honore, the daily said. Entire coastal communities in Louisiana and Mississippi have been devastated by Hurricane Katrina when it made landfall Monday with 225 kilometer (140 mile) per hour winds and torrential rain. Most of low-lying New Orleans was under water from the hurricane and from a broken levee holding back Lake Pontchartrain. A majority of its half a million residents have been evacuated. Authorities in Biloxi, Mississippi, which sustained widespread damage from the storm are estimating the death toll in the hundreds, as rescue crews up and down the Gulf coast are facing extreme difficulties in reaching victims. Besides the emergency teams sent by the Pentagon, The New York Times also reported that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had sent 23 disaster medical assistance teams. The Department of Transportation has dispatched 390 trucks carrying water, ice, tarps, mobile homes, generators, forklifts and disaster supplies to the flood damaged areas, the daily said. And the Department of health and Human Services has sent dozens of public health officers and loads of medical supplies to the stricken region. The Pentagon also said that the governors or Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi had called up some 10,000 members of their National Guards and were expected to mobilize more. Other neighboring states, including Arkansas and Texas were also calling up their National Guards to assist in the relief operation, the newspaper said quoting Pentagon sources. The Bush administration will release oil from federal petroleum reserves to help refiners affected by Hurricane Katrina, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said Wednesday. The move, which was expected later in the day, is designed to give refineries a temporary supply of crude oil to take the place of interrupted shipments from tankers or offshore oil platforms affected by the storm. The U.S. Minerals Management Service said Tuesday that 95 percent of the Gulf of Mexico's oil output was out of service. Oil prices surged back above $70 in European markets on Wednesday but slipped quickly to $69.56 after disclosure of the decision involving the release of supplies from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Eight refineries were shut down due to Katrina _ half of them producing gasoline. The government's emergency petroleum stockpile _ nearly 700 million barrels of oil stored in underground salt caverns along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast _ was established to cushion oil markets during energy disruptions. The production and distribution of oil and gas remained severely disrupted by the shutdown of a key oil import terminal off the coast of Louisiana and by the Gulf region's widespread loss of electricity, which is needed to power pipelines and refineries. The Environmental Protection Agency, seeking to avert a severe supply crunch, announced it would temporarily allow the sale of higher- polluting gasoline in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi because those states can't provide enough fuel to consumers that meets Clean Air Act requirements. The agency also said those states will be allowed to use motor vehicle diesel fuel with a sulfur content higher than the 500 parts per million standard for the next two weeks through ozone season. President Bush, meanwhile, was returning to Washington on Wednesday to oversee the federal response to Katrina. He planned to chair a meeting of a White House task force set up to coordinate federal efforts, across more than a dozen agencies, to assist hurricane victims. Bush also was expected to visit the ravaged region by week's end, but details on that trip were in flux as the White House worked to make sure a presidential tour would not disrupt the relief and response efforts. Bodman, speaking on CNBC, said the decision to release reserves was made late Tuesday. \"In a word. It is going to be done,\" Bodman said. \"Last evening it was approved and I think you'll be seeing an announcement about it later in the day. So we are doing everything we can to be responsive.\" He said the reserve was contained in five sites, four of which are operative. The site in New Orleans is not. Bodman said it was too early to say how much oil would be released. He said his department was dealing with inquiries from three companies about getting oil from the reserve. On Monday, Citgo Petroleum Corp. asked for 250,000 to 500,000 barrels to ensure that its Lake Charles, La., refinery doesn't run out. \"There is an issue with respect to getting electrical power so that we can operate the various pipe lines that supply fuel to the rest of the country,\" he said, noting that these facilities \"deliver finished products, diesel and gasoline, to the Northeast and to the Southeast.\" \"Our job is to get the infrastructure going again,\" Bodman said. \"To the extent that we have delays in getting these pipelines functioning, then were are going to have the potential for gasoline shortages.\" Bodman said the administration will \"do everything we can do to get fuel available to the rest of the country.\" Of tapping the SPR, Bodman said: \"Technically it's called an exchange of oil that we deliver today and that we will get oil back plus some interest, if you will, in the future. We will be tapping that today.\" Interviewed on the Fox News' \"Fox and Friends First,\" Bodman was asked if price gouging is taking place. \"I would like to believe that in this time of crisis that all of us are going to pull together to try to deal with this very difficult circumstance and situation that's confronting not just this region, but this country,\" he replied. \"We're hopeful of that, but if we have some bad actors, we have a mechanism to deal with it.\" WASHINGTON -- Sewage and chemicals are mixed into a potentially toxic bathtub soaking New Orleans, posing the threat of disease for residents forced to wade in Hurricane Katrina's floodwaters. \"Probably the more immediate health risk to the people is that whatever was in the sewer is in the water,\" said John Pardue, director of the Louisiana Water Resources Research Institute at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. \"Whatever bacterial or viral diseases that people put into the system before the flooding is now in the water.\" Meanwhile, scientists say they're alarmed by how much of the region's environmental defenses against future hurricanes and other big storms have become seriously compromised. Officials with the U.S. Geological Survey who flew over the Gulf Coast from Florida to Louisiana said Thursday that most of the Chandeleur chain of barrier islands _ the first line of storm defense for eastern Louisiana and western Mississippi _ appears to be gone. What is usually a continuous line of dunes is now just marshy outcrops, said Ann Tihansky, a hydrologist with the survey. \"It's unbelievable,\" she said, after reviewing the results of an aerial video survey. \"It just makes the coastline more and more susceptible because more of that storm surge can move further inland,\" said Glenn Guntenspergen, a U.S. Geological Survey landscape ecologist who has studied the effect of hurricanes on Gulf Coast ecosystems. With the loss of the islands and wetlands that buffer the region, he said, \"It becomes less and less likely for the systems to be able to recover from these kinds of storms. The systems as a whole are rapidly losing their ability to recover.\" Along with the sewage in the floodwater is a witches' brew of chemicals from a variety of sources, including leaking fuels and oils from gas stations and submerged cars, paints and solvents from small businesses and household cleaners and pesticides from peoples' homes. But the biggest chemical plants and refineries to the south and east of the city were spared a direct hit by the hurricane. If that had happened, breaches in large tanks and other industrial facilities might have spewed heavy petroleum, hydrocarbons and chlorine gas. \"From the perspective of chemical or environmental contamination, it could have been much worse. One advantage is that we have so much water in the city and that dilutes out the chemicals,\" Pardue said. \"People shouldn't have an irrational fear of chemicals in the water. I'm more concerned about the viral and bacterial things. There's going to be a lot of gastrointestinal and public health issues.\" Besides the broken sewage systems polluting the floodwaters, breached drinking water systems are no longer functioning. Sam Coleman, a regional director for EPA's Superfund toxic waste division in Dallas, said he could not predict how long it would take to clean, disinfect and then test the hundreds of small community drinking water systems that no longer work because of the loss of power. \"Personally, I've never seen anything like this,\" he said. \"No one has quite seen it this bad.\" Violence disrupted relief efforts Thursday in New Orleans as authorities rescued desperate residents still trapped in the flooded city and tried to evacuate thousands of others living among corpses and human waste. Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Michael Brown said his agency was attempting to work \"under conditions of urban warfare.\" Police snipers were stationed on the roof of their precinct, trying to protect it from armed miscreants roaming seemingly at will. Officers warned a CNN crew to stay off the streets because of escalating danger, and cautioned others about attempted shootings and rapes by groups of young men. \"This is a desperate SOS,\" New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin said in a statement Thursday afternoon, with thousands of people stranded at the city's convention center with no food, water or electricity -- and fading hope. (See video on the desperate conditions -- 4:36 ) Residents expressed growing frustration with the disorder evident on the streets, raising questions about the coordination and timeliness of relief efforts. \"Why is no one in charge?\" asked one frustrated evacuee at the convention center. \"I find it hard to believe.\" Government officials insisted they were putting forth their best efforts and pleaded for patience, saying further help was on the way. One displaced resident at the Louisiana Superdome issued a warning to authorities who may be headed to the stadium, where up to 30,000 people sought refuge after Monday's Hurricane Katrina and now await evacuation to Texas by bus. \"Please don't send the National Guard,\" Raymond Cooper told CNN by telephone. \"Send someone with a bullhorn outside the place that can talk to these people first.\" He described scenes of lawlessness and desperation, with people simply dragging corpses into corners. \"They have quite a few people running around here with guns,\" he said. \"You got these young teenage boys running around up here raping these girls.\" Elsewhere, groups of armed men wandered the streets, buildings smoldered and people picked through stores for what they could find. Charity Hospital, one of several facilities attempting to evacuate patients, was forced to halt the effort after coming under sniper fire. (Full story) Recovery efforts also continued Thursday in Mississippi, where Katrina smashed entire neighborhoods and killed at least 185 people. \"We got hit by the worst natural disaster in the history of the United States,\" Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour told CNN Thursday.\n\n 'Thousands' dead Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco gave the grim news that \"thousands\" of people died in the hurricane and its aftermath in New Orleans and surrounding parishes, though she said no official count had been compiled. Brown said those who ignored the city's mandatory evacuation order bore some responsibility. \"I think the death toll may go into the thousands and, unfortunately, that's going to be attributable a lot to people who did not heed the advance warnings,\" he told CNN. (Full story) Stranded people remained in buildings, on roofs, in the backs of trucks or gathered in large groups on higher ground, with little knowledge of when -- or if -- help would come. Despite the deteriorating conditions in the city, hurricane survivors from neighboring Plaquemines Parish have started streaming into the city, according to Nagin. \"We are overwhelmed and out of resources, but we welcome them with open arms and will figure this out together,\" the mayor said in a written statement. Police officers told CNN that some of their fellow officers had simply stopped showing up for duty, cutting manpower by 20 percent or more in some precincts. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said Thursday that 4,200 National Guard troops trained as military police will be deployed in New Orleans over the next three days, which he said would quadruple the law enforcement presence in the city. Pentagon officials said the first contingent of 100 military police officers would arrive at Louis Armstrong International Airport at 10 p.m. (11 p.m. ET) -- combat-ready for immediate deployment in New Orleans.\n\n 'Unsanitary and unsafe' Blanco said Thursday she has requested the mobilization of 40,000 National Guard troops to restore order and assist in relief efforts. A humanitarian catastrophe unfolded at the convention center, where thousands of increasingly frustrated people waited for help amid dead bodies, feces and garbage. Numerous bodies could be seen, both inside and outside the facility, and one man died of a seizure while a CNN crew was at the scene. A National Guard helicopter dropped food and water Thursday afternoon, although the amount was far short of enough to meet the needs of the throngs that had gathered. Nagin advised those gathered at the center to march over the Crescent City Connection bridge to the west bank of the Mississippi River to find relief in neighboring Jefferson Parish. \"The convention center is unsanitary and unsafe, and we are running out of supplies,\" said Nagin, adding that officials did not expect to have enough buses for evacuations. Brown told CNN Thursday evening that federal officials only found out about the convention center crisis earlier in the day, and that he had since directed that \"all available resources\" be made available there. Boat rescue teams looking for Katrina survivors told CNN they had been ordered to stand down Thursday by FEMA officials concerned about security. However, FEMA issued a statement from Washington denying it had suspended operations, though the agency conceded there had been \"isolated incidents where security has become an issue.\" Homeland Security Secretary MichaelChertoff said that the Coast Guard has rescued about 3,000 people from flooded areas in New Orleans and the surrounding parishes. At the city's airport, a field hospital set up by FEMA was \"overwhelmed\" with patients, a medical team commander said. Equipment normally used to move luggage was instead ferrying patients to a treatment center and to planes and buses for evacuation. \"I do not have the words in my vocabulary to describe what is happening here,\" said Ozro Henderson. \"'Catastrophe' and 'disaster' don't explain it.\" Outside the Superdome, throngs of people waiting for a bus ride to Texas completely covered an outside plaza, where they waited in the heat and rain. Buses ferried displaced residents to Houston's Astrodome, which will serve as a shelter until FEMA can come up with more permanent housing. \"We're finding more and more people coming out of the woodwork,\" Brown said. \"They're appearing in places we didn't know they existed.\" Blanco said more school buses would be brought in from across Louisiana to increase the pace of the evacuation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it expected to complete the sealing off of the 17th Street Canal, where a flood-control levee breached. Explosions, Fires All Over Lawless New Orleans An explosion at a chemical depot jolted residents awake early Friday, illuminating the pre-dawn sky with red and orange flames over a city awash in corpses and under siege from looters. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Vibrations from the blast along the Mississippi River and a few miles east of the French Quarter were felt all the way downtown. A series of smaller blasts followed and then a pillar of acrid, black smoke. To jittery residents of flood-devastated New Orleans, it was yet another fearful sign of collapse in a city that has been plunged into lawlessness and despair since Hurricane Katrina slammed ashore Monday morning. Congress was rushing through a $10.5 billion aid package, the Pentagon promised to send in 1,400 National Guardsmen a day to stop the looting and President Bush planned to visit the region Friday. But city officials were seething with anger over what they called a slow federal response to a disaster that may have killed thousands. \"They don't have a clue what's going on down there,\" Mayor Ray Nagin told WWL-AM Thursday night. \"They flew down here one time two days after the doggone event was over with TV cameras, AP reporters, all kind of goddamn _ excuse my French everybody in America, but I am pissed.\" In Washington, President Bush answered the criticism of the government response to the disaster by saying \"the results are not acceptable\" and pledged to bolster relief efforts with a personal trip to the Gulf Coast. \"We'll get on top of this situation,\" he said, \"and we're going to help the people that need help.\" Thursday saw thousands being evacuated by bus to Houston from the hot and stinking Superdome. Fistfights and fires erupted amid a seething sea of tense, suffering people who waited in a lines that stretched a half-mile to board yellow school buses. The looting continued. Gov. Kathleen Blanco called the looters \"hoodlums\" and issued a warning to lawbreakers: Hundreds of National Guardsmen hardened on the battlefield in Iraq have landed in New Orleans. \"They have M-16s and they're locked and loaded,\" she said. \"These troops know how to shoot and kill, and they are more than willing to do so, and I expect they will.\" At the Superdome, group of refugees broke through a line of heavily armed National Guardsmen in a scramble to get on to the buses. Nearby, about 15,000 to 20,000 people who had taken shelter at New Orleans Convention Center grew ever more hostile after waiting for buses for days amid the filth and the dead. Police Chief Eddie Compass said there was such a crush around a squad of 88 officers that they retreated when they went in to check out reports of assaults. \"We have individuals who are getting raped, we have individuals who are getting beaten,\" Compass said. \"Tourists are walking in that direction and they are getting preyed upon.\" By Thursday evening, 11 hours after the military began evacuating the Superdome, the arena held 10,000 more people than it did at dawn. Evacuees from across the city swelled the crowd to about 30,000 because they believed the arena was the best place to get a ride out of town. Some of those among the mostly poor crowd had been in the dome for four days without air conditioning, working toilets or a place to bathe. One military policeman was shot in the leg as he and a man scuffled for the MP's rifle. The man was arrested. By late Thursday, the flow of refugees to the Houston Astrodome was temporarily halted after about 11,000 people had arrived _ less than half the estimated 23,000 people expected. \"We've actually reached capacity for the safety and comfort of the people inside there,\" American Red Cross spokeswoman Dana Allen said. She said people were \"packed pretty tight\" on the floor. Texas Gov. Rick Perry announced that Dallas would host 25,000 more refugees at Reunion Arena and 25,000 others would relocate to a San Antonio warehouse at KellyUSA, a city-owned complex that once was home to an Air Force base. Houston estimated as many as 55,000 people who fled the hurricane were staying in area hotels. The blasts early Friday rocked a chemical storage facility along the river, said Lt. Michael Francis of the Harbor Police. At least two police boats could be seen at the scene and a hazardous material team was on route. Francis did not have any other information. While floodwaters in New Orleans appeared to stabilize, efforts continued to plug three breaches in the levees that protect this bowl- shaped, below-sea-level city, which is wedged between Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River. Helicopters dropped sandbags into the breach and pilings were being pounded into the mouth of the canal Thursday to close its connection to the lake. At least seven bodies were scattered outside the convention center, a staging area for those rescued from rooftops, attics and highways. The sidewalks were packed with people without food, water or medical care, and with no sign of law enforcement. A military helicopter tried to land at the convention center several times to drop off food and water. But the rushing crowd forced the choppers to back off. Troopers then tossed the supplies to the crowd from 10 feet off the ground and flew away. \"There's a lot of very sick people _ elderly ones, infirm ones _ who can't stand this heat, and there's a lot of children who don't have water and basic necessities to survive on,\" said Daniel Edwards, 47, outside the center. \"We need to eat, or drink water at the very least.\" An old man in a chaise lounge lay dead in a grassy median as hungry babies wailed around him. Around the corner, an elderly woman lay dead in her wheelchair, covered up by a blanket, and another body lay beside her wrapped in a sheet. \"I don't treat my dog like that,\" Edwards said as he pointed at the woman in the wheelchair. \"You can do everything for other countries, but you can't do nothing for your own people.\" Michael Brown, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said FEMA just learned about the situation at the convention center Thursday and quickly scrambled to provide food, water and medical care and remove the corpses. The mayor lashed out at the government, saying: \"I have no idea what they're doing, but I will tell you this: God is looking down on all this and if they're not doing everything in their power to save people, they are going to pay the price because every day that we delay, people are dying and they're dying by the hundreds.\" Across the city, law and order broke down, and the rescuers themselves were being shot at. Tourist Debbie Durso of Washington, Mich., said she asked a police officer for assistance and his response was, \"'Go to hell _ it's every man for himself.'\" FEMA officials said some operations had to be suspended in areas where gunfire had broken out. Outside a looted Rite-Aid drugstore, some people were anxious to show they needed what they were taking. A gray-haired man who would not give his name pulled up his T-shirt to show a surgery scar and explained that he needs pads for incontinence. \"I'm a Christian,\" he said. \"I feel bad going in there.\" Hospitals struggled to evacuate critically ill patients who were dying for lack of oxygen, insulin or intravenous fluids. But when some hospitals try to airlift patients, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Cheri Ben- Iesan said, \"there are people just taking potshots at police and at helicopters, telling them, `You better come get my family.'\" To make matters worse, the chief of the Louisiana State Police said he heard of numerous instances of New Orleans police officers _ many of whom from flooded areas _ turning in their badges. \"They indicated that they had lost everything and didn't feel that it was worth them going back to take fire from looters and losing their lives,\" Col. Henry Whitehorn said. World stunned as US struggles with Katrina The world has watched amazed as the planet's only superpower struggles with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, with some saying the chaos has exposed flaws and deep divisions in American society. World leaders and ordinary citizens have expressed sympathy with the people of the southern United States whose lives were devastated by the hurricane and the flooding that followed. But many have also been shocked by the images of disorder beamed around the world -- looters roaming the debris-strewn streets and thousands of people gathered in New Orleans waiting for the authorities to provide food, water and other aid. \"Anarchy in the USA\" declared Britain's best-selling newspaper The Sun. The pictures of the catastrophe -- which has killed hundreds and possibly thousands -- have evoked memories of crises in the world's poorest nations such as last year's tsunami in Asia, which left more than 230,000 people dead or missing. But some view the response to those disasters more favorably than the lawless aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. \"I am absolutely disgusted. After the tsunami our people, even the ones who lost everything, wanted to help the others who were suffering,\" said Sajeewa Chinthaka, 36, as he watched a cricket match in Colombo, Sri Lanka. \"Not a single tourist caught in the tsunami was mugged. Now with all this happening in the U.S. we can easily see where the civilized part of the world's population is.\" Many newspapers highlighted criticism of local and state authorities and of President Bush. Some compared the sputtering relief effort with the massive amounts of money and resources poured into the war in Iraq. \"A modern metropolis sinking in water and into anarchy -- it is a really cruel spectacle for a champion of security like Bush,\" France's left-leaning Liberation newspaper said. \"(Al Qaeda leader Osama) bin Laden, nice and dry in his hideaway, must be killing himself laughing.\" A female employee at a multinational firm in South Korea said it may have been no accident the U.S. was hit. \"Maybe it was punishment for what it did to Iraq, which has a man-made disaster, not a natural disaster,\" said the woman, who did not want to be named as she has an American manager. \"A lot of the people I work with think this way. We spoke about it just the other day,\" she said. Commentators noted the victims of the hurricane were overwhelmingly African Americans, too poor to flee the region as the hurricane loomed unlike some of their white neighbors. New Orleans ranks fifth in the United States in terms of African American population and 67 percent of the city's residents are black. \"In one of the poorest states in the country, where black people earn half as much as white people, this has taken on a racial dimension,\" said a report in Britain's Guardian daily. Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn, in a veiled criticism of U.S. political thought, said the disaster showed the need for a strong state that could help poor people. \"You see in this example that even in the 21st century you need the state, a good functioning state, and I hope that for all these people, these poor people, that the Americans will do their best,\" he told reporters at a European Union meeting in Newport, Wales. David Fordham, 33, a hospital anesthetist speaking at a London underground rail station, said he had spent time in America and was not surprised the country had struggled to cope. \"Maybe they just thought they could sit it out and everything would be okay,\" he said. \"It's unbelievable though -- the TV images -- and your heart goes out to them.\" Angry New Orleans Mayor Says Feds Don't Have A Clue The once-glorious city of New Orleans is in ruins and its people in chaos from Hurricane Katrina. For those who sought refuge in the New Orleans convention center, it became just another part of the nightmare. There are reports of rapes, beatings and fights in the convention center, where at least 15,000 people have sought safety. Police Chief Eddie Compass said hotels have sent away their tourists and the displaced people are \"walking in that direction and they are getting preyed upon.\" But when he sent in 88 officers to quell the situation at the building, they were driven back by a mob. He said, \"They were beaten back within 30 feet of the entrance.\" The mayor of New Orleans is seething over what he sees as the government's slow response to his city's disaster. Ray Nagin went on WWL Radio Thursday night to say the feds \"don't have a clue what's going on.\" He added, \"Excuse my French -- everybody in America -- but I am pissed.\" Nagin said that there are many drug addicts who are searching for a fix. He said that's why they are breaking into drug stores and hospitals. \"What you are seeing is drug-starving crazy addicts that are wreaking havoc and we don't have the manpower that we can deal with it,\" Nagin said. Nagin is angry, and wants people to flood the offices of the president and the governor with letters calling for help. He thinks not enough is being done to help the evacuees. He said that federal officials \"don't have a clue what's going on.\" \"Get off your asses and let's do something and let's fix the biggest goddamn crisis in the history of this country,\" Nagin said. \"People are dying. They don't have homes, they don't have jobs. The city of New Orleans will never be the same. And it's time.\" The mayor said he needs troops and hundreds of buses to get evacuees out. He said that it was laughable that some officials had mentioned possibly having school bus drivers brought to New Orleans to help with the evacuation. \"I'm like, 'You have got to be kidding me.' This is a national disaster, get every doggone Greyhound bus line in the country and get their asses to New Orleans,\" he said. \"This is a major, major, major deal.\" Nagin accused state and federal officials of \"playing games\" and \"spinning for the cameras.\" He said he keeps hearing that help is coming, but \"there's no beef.\" He called for a moratorium on press conferences. He said he doesn't want any more press conferences there until there is actual manpower on the ground helping his city. He said that he is tired of hearing that thousands of troops are on their way because they are just not there. Earlier, he issued a \"desperate SOS\" on behalf of the thousands who are stranded at the convention center. He also gave the go-ahead for them to march across a bridge to a dry area of the city and look for whatever relief they could find. At least seven bodies were scattered outside the convention center. People desperately called for help, chasing after reporters, sometimes pleading and sometimes threatening. Congress is rushing through an aid package of more than $10 billion and the Pentagon is promising 1,400 National Guardsmen. One evacuee said the victims have been left \"like pure animals\" with no care. The New Orleans police chief said 15,000 people are trapped in the city's convention center. And he said some are being raped and beaten. Alan Gould, a man who is an evacuee inside the convention center, told CNN that women and small children are being raped and killed. He called it genocide. He said officials keep giving them the runaround, saying \"Help is coming. Help is coming. Help is coming.\" But he said people just keep dying. A 68-year-old minister who's stranded with thousands of other evacuees at the New Orleans Convention Center said, \"We are out here living like pure animals.\" The Rev. Isaac Clark said, \"We don't have water. We don't have food. We don't have help.\" A 23-year-old woman tending to her 4-year-old daughter said, \"God is punishing New Orleans\" for its corruption and crime. At least seven bodies were scattered outside the convention center. People desperately called for help, chasing after reporters, sometimes pleading and sometimes threatening. Louisiana's governor is declaring war on looters and others who've turned the streets of New Orleans into scenes of chaos and fear. Gov. Kathleen Blanco said 300 National Guard troops have arrived in the city fresh from duty in Iraq. She said they \"know how to shoot and kill, and they are more than willing to do so, and I expect they will.\" The Guard troops are carrying M-16s, which Blanco describes as \"locked and loaded.\" Within the angry crowds of people trying to flee the city, shooters have targeted police officers, a security person at the Superdome and possibly a military helicopter evacuating hospital patients. A Louisiana state police commander said many New Orleans officers have quit, saying they weren't going to risk their lives to fight looters. Meanwhile, evacuees chanted \"We want help!\" Thursday outside the New Orleans convention center. Many have been there for days, without food, water or sanitary services. At least seven corpses are there as well. Those at the convention center are increasingly hungry, desperate and tired of waiting for buses to return them to the fresh air of civilization. As the mayor asked for buses, he also made an apparent effort to defuse what could be an explosive situation. The mayor said people will be allowed to march across a bridge to the city's unflooded west bank, for whatever relief they can find. At the hot and stinking Superdome, there's a snarl in the effort to evacuate storm evacuees to Houston. More people keep arriving, swelling the number from 20,000 to 30,000. A National Guard captain said people are coming from around the city, hoping to get a ride out of town. Lines to board buses to Texas stretch for nearly half a mile. Fights are breaking out, and one military policeman was shot in the leg in a scuffle for his rifle. A New Orleans official is calling the situation a \"national disgrace.\" Fights and fires have erupted and corpses are openly scattered throughout the city. Rescue helicopters and law enforcement officers have been targeted by gunfire. The National Guard wants hurricane-ravaged New Orleans to know the cavalry is coming. Lt. Gen. Steven Blum of the National Guard said 7,000 National Guardsmen are arriving in Louisiana Friday \"to save Louisiana citizens.\" He said the only thing they'll be attacking is \"the effects of the hurricane,\" but adds they are prepared to \"put down\" the violence \"in a quick and efficient manner.\" Blum said a huge airlift of supplies is due Friday, signaling \"the cavalry is and will continue to arrive.\" The National Guard's assurances come amid stinging criticism from the mayor and others who say the federal government has bungled the relief effort. People haven't had food, water, medicine or power since the storm struck Monday. President George W. Bush is admitting efforts to help Hurricane Katrina's victims have fallen short. Leaving the White House to tour the stricken Gulf Coast, he declared, \"The results are not acceptable.\" However, Bush is vowing to \"get on top of this situation\" and to \"help people who need help.\" Bush is flying to Mobile, Alabama, for a briefing from emergency chiefs, then getting a helicopter tour of flattened coastal communities. He plans to walk through one of the hardest-hit: Biloxi, Mississippi. But in New Orleans, which has been hit by looting and is mostly under water, Bush will just fly over and land at the airport several miles from the city center. On departing the White House, Bush said he wants to thank rescue workers for their efforts -- and assure Katrina's victims that the administration \"will deploy the assets necessary.\" A series of explosions has rocked the riverfront a few miles south of the French Quarter in New Orleans. The explosions appeared to come from an area on the east bank of the Mississippi River, near a residential area and railroad tracks. At least two police boats were at the scene. The first explosion sent flames shooting into the pre-dawn sky. A series of smaller blasts followed and then acrid, black smoke that could be seen even in the dark. The vibrations were felt all the way downtown. All this has happened amid continuing lawlessness in the city swamped by Hurricane Katrina. The governor has ordered in hundreds of battle-hardened troops just back from Iraq. Astrodome Declared Full; Evacuees Sent To Other Shelters After accepting more than 11,000 Hurricane Katrina evacuees, officials say the Houston Astrodome is full. So, they've begun sending buses to other shelters in the Houston area. The total of 11,000 inside the Astrodome is less than half the estimated 23,000 people who were expected to arrive by bus from New Orleans. Buses that continue to arrive are being sent on to other shelters in the area and as far away as Huntsville, about an hour north of Houston. Meanwhile, by unanimous consent of those present, the Senate has approved $10.5 billion in aid for the hurricane victims. The House will meet Friday at noon to speed the measure to President George W. Bush's desk. A skeleton crew of Senate leaders was all that was needed to speed the measure through by voice vote Thursday night. Although the Astrodome is full, the state of Texas is rolling out an even bigger welcome mat for evacuees. Officials are agreeing to take another 25,000 displaced residents, bringing the grand total to 73,000. The cities of Dallas, Houston and San Antonio will become new homes for storm evacuees, many from hard-hit New Orleans. Already, the Astrodome in Houston and Dallas' Reunion Arena have been converted into giant shelters. Now, a warehouse in San Antonio and its Joe Freeman Arena will also be used to house people. San Antonio Mayor Phil Hardberger hopes for a system in which evacuees can get their needs resolved in one central place. He says he hopes to restore \"some dignity which these circumstances have taken away from\" storm evacuees. The American Red Cross is also running shelters in other Texas cities. Doctors at two public hospitals in New Orleans have called The Associated Press to plead for rescue. The physicians say they are nearly out of food and power and have been forced to move patients to higher floors to escape looters. Dr. Norman McSwain said he and his colleagues at Charity Hospital have turned to The AP as a last resort. McSwain said he tried calling the mayor and the governor, using any \"inside pressure\" possible, to no avail. McSwain said there is minimal water. The food amounts to fruit bowl punch. The scene is similar at University hospital. Another doctor, Lee Hamm, said somehow the two public facilities have been forgotten -- or ignored. Mississippi's death toll from Hurricane Katrina has reached 126 as more rescue teams spread out to search for the living. All along the 90-mile coast, emergency workers are performing the grisly task of retrieving bodies. Some of the dead are lying on streets and in the ruins of obliterated homes that stretch back blocks from the beach. Tons of rotting shrimp and chickens blown from containers at a shipping dock were dumped into the water and onto the tattered landscape. As many as 882,000 homes or businesses are still without electricity. Some won't have power for weeks -- or longer, state emergency officials said. Even in northern Mississippi, locals and stranded evacuees wait for hours to buy gasoline at upward of $3 a gallon. There were complaints that a few stations were selling gas for up to $6 a gallon. Tiny Hamlets Do Nothing But Wait For Help Some of the places that are worst off after Hurricane Katrina are tiny places with names such as Bond, Thomasville, Maxie and Star. They're Mississippi hamlets miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. The few people who live amid the pines in the small houses and single-wide trailers are mostly black and poor. They have no food, water, electricity or gasoline after getting a direct hit from Katrina. Red Cross trucks and the National Guard and the local power trucks are roaring right by. They're heading for places where there are larger numbers of victims. A woman in Bond saod \"people back here are going to starve\" if someone doesn't stop soon. In Thomasville, a woman whose family has been cooking meals on a barbecue grill said they're \"learning to do without.\" A collection of scenes that have amazed, impressed, and horrified us over the past few days: At least seven dead bodies were scattered among the thousands of storm evacuees who'd been waiting for days outside the New Orleans Convention Center. One man, pointing to a dead woman in a wheelchair, said, \"I don't treat my dog like that. I buried my dog.\" An old man lay dead in a chaise lounge in a grassy median, as hungry babies wailed around him. The Coast Guard said that when helicopters tried to take people out of New Orleans hospitals, they were shot at by people demanding that the choppers come to rescue their own family members. In coastal Mississippi, refrigerated mobile morgues cruised around like garbage trucks, picking up bodies left on sidewalks and in front yards. Family members tried to treat the bodies with respect, wrapping them in curtains or sheets they can find in the debris. For those who sought refuge in the New Orleans convention center, it became just another part of the nightmare. Police Chief Eddie Compass said some of the thousands trapped there are being raped, and others beaten. He says hotels have sent away their tourists and are being \"preyed upon.\" The chief says he sent in officers to quell the situation, but they were quickly beaten back by an angry mob. The street outside the New Orleans convention center is choked with dirty diapers, old bottles and garbage, and it smells of urine and feces. People chanted, \"Help, help!\" as reporters and photographers walked through. The crowd got angry when journalists tried to photograph one of the dead bodies, and covered it over with a blanket. A woman, screaming, went on the front steps of the convention center and led the crowd in reciting the 23rd Psalm. A visiting sheriff's detective from Florida says he saw people wave down a squad car near the convention center last night. The car slowed down, and the crowd swarmed -- causing the officer to drive off and return with other officers. He says the officers told the crowd, \"Everybody down, or we're going to shoot\" -- and the people scattered. One looter sobbed as she took items from a store's shelves and put them into plastic garbage bags to take to her shelter. She was taking children's clothing and snack foods, but couldn't find any water. Another woman on a bicycle rode up to a drug store and asked if people were being arrested. When told that they weren't, she said she was a diabetic and that she needed test strips. A tourist trapped in a New Orleans hotel says \"No one really knows what to do.\" Susan Dewey says \"The people who are left are just going and breaking into stores.\" She says you see people dragging bags of shoes, then later, \"you would see piles of shoe boxes.\" Dewey thought she'd found a way out when she banded with hundreds of other tourists to hire ten buses for $25,000. But, after waiting hours, they learned government officials had commandeered the buses to evacuate others. There are also acts of kindness. One woman was seen using a broken-up soda carton to fan a woman in a wheelchair, trying to keep her cool. In an apparent bid to lift her spirits, she kept asking the woman if she wanted ice cream, or a cola. Someone commandeered a golf cart from the convention center and drove off, carrying the woman in a wheelchair. For the evacuees arriving at the Houston Astrodome from New Orleans, a shower in one of the stadium's four locker rooms was a welcome relief. But for Audree Lee, it was a relief as well to hear the voice of her teen-age daughter for the first time since the storm. She says she and her daughter both cried, and that the girl asked about her dog. She says, \"They wouldn't let me take her dog with me...I know the dog is gone now.\" Reporters and politicians in the area devastated by the hurricane are being begged by survivors to pass information to their families. Louisiana's Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu had a pocket full of scraps of paper on which he scribbled down phone numbers. This morning, he contacted a woman whose father had been rescued, and told her, \"Your daddy's alive, and he said to tell you he loves you.\" He says the woman started crying and said, \"I thought he was dead.\" The relative calm of night was disrupted early Friday with a series of massive explosions on the riverfront a few miles south of the French Quarter. Congress rushed a $10.5 billion recovery bill to President Bush, who called the relief effort the biggest in U.S. history. Texas agreed to triple to 75,000 the number of evacuees being taken in from Louisiana. Houston officials temporarily stopped admitting people to the Astrodome late Thursday after accepting 11,325. Others will be housed in the adjacent Reliant Center, where the Houston Texans play football. President Bush planned a tour of Gulf Coast communities battered by Hurricane Katrina, a visit aimed at alleviating criticism that he engineered a too-little, too-late response. Asia-Pacific nations - including tsunami-battered Sri Lanka - promised Friday to send money and disaster relief experts to the United States to help deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Lawmakers demanded an investigation into gasoline prices after thousands of motorists called a government hotline to complain of price gouging. The Energy Department reports more than 5,000 calls, though there was no way to immediately determine how many of the allegations were valid. Crude oil prices eased slightly Friday and gasoline futures fell for the first time in a week as several energy facilities on the Gulf Coast resumed operations. Crude oil contracts from November thru February - traditionally high demand months - were all trading above $70 a barrel. The military expects to put 30,000 National Guard troops on duty in the Gulf states as demands grow for more security and relief assistance, officials said.\n\nA day before President Bush headed to the hurricane-ravaged South, Mayor Ray Nagin lashed out at federal officials, telling a local radio station \"they don't have a clue what's going on down here.\" Federal officials expressed sympathy but quickly defended themselves, saying they, too, were overwhelmed by the catastrophe that hit the Gulf Coast region on Monday. Nagin's interview Thursday night on WWL radio came as President Bush planned to visit Gulf Coast communities battered by Hurricane Katrina, a visit aimed at alleviating criticism that he engineered a too- little, too-late response. Bush viewed the damage while flying over the region Wednesday en route to Washington after cutting short his Texas vacation by two days. \"They flew down here one time two days after the doggone event was over with TV cameras, AP reporters, all kind of goddamn _ excuse my French everybody in America, but I am pissed,\" Nagin said. Nagin said he told Bush in a recent conversation that \"we had an incredible crisis here and that his flying over in Air Force One does not do it justice ... I have been all around this city and that I am very frustrated because we are not able to marshal resources and we are outmanned in just about every respect.\" In an interview Friday on NBC's \"Today,\" Federal Emergency Management Agency director Michael Brown stood behind the massive federal relief effort that's under way. \"I understand the mayor's frustration. ... We have been having a continuous flow of commodities into the Superdome, there were five trucks arriving last night to feed well over 50,000 people. \"We're also diverting supplies to the convention center which I learned about yesterday and that area. ... This is an absolutely catastrophic disaster,\" he said. Gov. Kathleen Blanco, who like Nagin is a Democrat, was less confrontational than the mayor. \"When the system goes down, this is pretty much what you get,\" she said on CBS' \"The Early Show.\" \"We don't get into the blame game. We just work with what we got.\" NEW ORLEANS - A great city has descended into chaos. In much of New Orleans yesterday, food and water remained in short supply. Medical help was nowhere to be found. And answers were impossible to come by. Then hope ran out and it was the biggest loss of all. At the city's convention center, a frustrated and angry mob rioted, furious that they had been dumped at a place where there was no food, no water and no one in charge. At the Superdome, fights broke out in the huge crowd that assembled on an upper parking deck. The crowd jostled for position and hoped eventually to get on a bus to somewhere - anywhere. A man who asked for a cigarette got beaten with a pipe. Charles had walked to the Superdome in waist-high water with her five daughters, six grandkids, six nieces and nephews. They took turns keeping her mother, a 72-year-old amputee, afloat on an air mattress. Her mother was taken away a day earlier for medical treatment. \"Now we're going to Houston\" to the Astrodome, said Charles. \"Where will she be?\" As if things weren't bad enough, a rumor soon shot through the crowd that another hurricane was brewing in the Atlantic. It even had a name: Hurricane Leo. The anxious lines of people pushed against a National Guard barricade, sweaty and screaming and wishing it was all a bad dream. But compared to the convention center, the Superdome was at least controlled chaos. Daily News photographer Mike Appleton and I heard there was a riot under way at the convention center and headed over there. As we walked past the Windsor Court hotel, we were stopped by a female state trooper. \"Y'all came over here without guns? Don't go there. Don't go there unless you have a machine gun around your neck. We pulled our troops out because the civilians have taken over. We don't have the manpower to deal with them,\" she said. But Mike and I decided to press on. This is a story the world needs to hear. We passed a family next - three women and two men - frying chicken on a street corner. One of the men, wearing a 9-inch knife on his belt, wished us luck. \"Y'all better be strapped,\" he said as we walked by - strapped being slang for armed. The scene at the convention center was wild; the fury palpable. The people looked far more desperate and far more desolate than those at the Superdome. \"There's nobody of authority here,\" said A.G. Norton, 48. \"They left us here under the impression that they weren't going to put us in the Dome because of the conditions there. But what about the conditions here?\" There was no food or water and not a cop or a soldier to be seen. And overnight, I was told, 10 people had died. I was skeptical of the claim and a man took me to a massive refrigerator in the center's kitchen. Eight bodies were inside, though there was no power to keep the refrigerator on. I found the other two corpses around the back, on a loading dock. The body of an elderly woman sat in a wheelchair covered with a red-and-blue checkered cloth. Her feet stuck out and had blood on them. Next to her was a woman wrapped in a white sheet. A little while later, we heard the thump-thump-thump of a helicopter and a Black Hawk dropped from the gray sky into the parking lot. The mob rushed the copter, swarming it before it even had a chance to land. The soldiers inside opened the doors and pushed out cases of water and boxes of MREs - meals ready to eat. People pushed. People yelled. The old folks and kids grabbed what they could. The young men made out best, though some were willing to share their bounty. Others just kept what they had claimed and shouldered their way through the crowd. Claudia Sims, 54, watched from the side, her six grandkids all around her. They hadn't eaten in 24 hours. \"I can't compete with these people,\" she said. One of her little granddaughters waded into the throng and came back with a smile on her face. In her tiny hand was her bounty - a single MRE. Three minutes after landing, the copter lifted off and rose into the air. I have seen such scenes before, but always on television and always from faraway places. In Third World nations, but not here. As I watched the copter go, I thought to myself: Can this really be happening in America? A national talk-radio host believes the severity of Hurricane Katrina is clear evidence that civilization is now in the \"End Times\" described in the Bible. \"I don't think there's any doubt,\" George Noory said this morning on his \"Coast to Coast AM\" program. \"I think we're in it. I really do.\" While Noory explained he did not mean an imminent end to all life on Earth, he referred to the book of Revelation in the New Testament, saying current events are \"the beginning of the end.\" \"I cannot imagine the grief and the horror that the people in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana are undergoing,\" Noory said. \"I see it, I hear it, but you know what, unless it happens to you, it really doesn't affect you. \"In this particular case, eventually it's going to affect everybody in the United States in some form or fashion. And as you see the price of oil going up, as you see shortages, as you see the price at the grocery store going up, you're going to realize just how serious a tragedy this really is. \"It's time to rethink the priorities of this country first and foremost and I always have in this strange mind I have, I always wonder, why did this have to happen now? Think about that for a moment. If you believe that there are no coincidences, why would this happen? I mean why would divine Providence want this to happen to us now?\" Katrina's storm surge and flooding have some recollecting the post-Christmas tsunami which killed 200,000 people and left up to 5 million in need of basic services in a dozen Indian Ocean nations. At that time, some people reflected on the End-time warning from the Gospel of Luke, where Jesus stated: \"And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring ... .\" (Luke 21:25) Noory was joined on the program b",

            "text": "Hurricane Katrina has battered New Orleans, flooding entire neighbourhoods and causing widespread destruction, but it kept the worst of its deadly wrath for neighbouring Mississippi, where the Governor spoke of \"catastrophic damage\".\n\n \n\n The massive storm claimed at least six lives in the southern US states of Louisiana and Mississippi and reportedly left some residents trapped on rooftops after it pounded a wide area of the US Gulf coast.\n\n \n\n In New Orleans, about 200 people were stranded on rooftops in one neighbourhood and several \"bodies are floating in the water\", New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin - who ordered a mandatory evacuation of the city on Sunday - told WWLTV.\n\n \n\n The hurricane, which could be among the most costly in US history, virtually shut down crude production in the Gulf of Mexico, at one point sending oil prices surging to record highs.\n\n \n\n Packing winds of 240 kmh, the storm made landfall over Louisiana yesterday, and gradually lost strength after it hit the mainland east of New Orleans.\n\n \n\n While the flood-prone city of 1.4 million took a severe pounding, it was spared the even more punishing direct hit many had feared.\n\n \n\n But Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour said it crashed through his state \"like a tonne of bricks\", and expressed fears the death toll could rise as rescue teams reach areas cut off by floodwaters.\n\n \n\n \"We expect that catastrophic damage has been suffered on the coast,\" he said at a news conference in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\n \n\n His Louisiana counterpart Kathleen Blanco said weather conditions hampered rescue efforts in parts of New Orleans and surrounding areas that apparently \"have been devastated by high winds and floodwaters ... where we have heard reports of people stranded on rooftops\".\n\n \n\n Officials urged the hundreds of thousands of people who fled ahead of the storm to remain patient.\n\n\"The power is out, the phones are down and there is no food or water, and many trees are down,\" said Blanco.\n\n \n\n More than 1 million people in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama lost electricity.\n\n \n\n Authorities in Mississippi reported three deaths from the storm. Yesterday, three elderly people died, apparently from dehydration, as they were being evacuated from a nursing home in New Orleans. Katrina was blamed for another seven deaths when it battered Florida last week.\n\n \n\n Residents and tourists who stayed behind in New Orleans' famed French Quarter found a neighbourhood ravaged like a war zone.\n\n \n\n Historic houses with their trademark ironwork balconies, appeared to have suffered structural damage.\n\n \n\n Police stepped up patrols to prevent looting of deserted bars and shops in the neighbourhood famed for its annual Mardi Gras revelry.\n\n \n\n At the massive Superdome stadium that sheltered 10,000 people, winds tore off parts of the roof, letting water pour into the building.\n\n \n\n Radio reports said police had arrested seven looters in the city of Kenner,\n\n near New Orleans' Louis Armstrong International airport.\n\n \n\n Nagin said at least 20 buildings in the city had collapsed and that it might be 48 hours before residents would be allowed back to their homes to assess the devastation as boats were dispatched on rescue missions.\n\n \n\n In Mobile, Alabama, an oil rig tore free of its moorings before surging downriver and smashing into a suspension bridge, witnesses said.\n\n \n\n The storm lost a little of its monstrous power overnight, but still slammed ashore at category four, the second-highest level on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane intensity scale. It gradually weakened to category one as it slowly moved inland.\n\n \n\n Officials warned that Katrina remained extremely dangerous, and US President George Bush urged residents to hunker down as long as the \"devastating storm\" rages.\n\n\"In the meantime, America will pray, pray for the health and safety of all our citizens,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Oil markets also kept a close watch on the hurricane, which shut down 92 per cent of US crude output in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n \n\n Oil prices had rocketed over a new high of $US70 a barrel, but prices later dropped to $US67.20 in New York after the US Government said it could release strategic crude reserves.\n\n \n\n The storm's insurance damages could be among the most severe in US history, said Robert Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute.\n\n\"There are estimates out there ranging from $US12 to $US25 billion,\" he said.\n\n \n\n Bush declared a state of emergency for Louisiana and Mississippi, clearing the way for federal aid to affected areas.\n\n\"I want the folks there on the Gulf coast to know that the Federal Government is prepared to help you when the storm passes,\" he said.\n\n \n\n AFP",

            "text": "NEW ORLEANS, Aug. 30 - The waters of swollen Lake Pontchartrain poured into this sunken city today through a gaping hole in a storm-damaged levee, as emergency workers labored to stanch the flow and used boats and helicopters to rescue hundreds of people stranded on rooftops.\n\nA day after Katrina ripped through here, city officials announced that they were moving their government out of town, which they said was 80 percent under increasingly contaminated water, and state officials ordered everyone else except emergency workers to evacuate as well.\n\nElectric power was out, phone service was spotty and the supply of food and clean drinking water was dwindling, officials said. Tens of thousands of people were reported in shelters in Louisiana and Mississippi, the states hardest hit by Katrina.\n\n\"The situation is untenable,\" Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana said at an afternoon news briefing. \"It's just heartbreaking.\" But, she vowed, \"we will recover.\"\n\nMayor C. Ray Nagin of New Orleans said on CNN that his unique and historic city, which had been jarringly transformed overnight, was \"in a state of devastation.\"\n\n\"We're not even dealing with dead bodies,\" Mr. Nagin said, according to The Associated Press. \"They're just pushing them on the side.\"\n\nGas fires were erupting throughout the city, looters were raiding abandoned businesses downtown, hospitals were making plans to airlift critically ill patients to other cities, numerous roadways were buckled, and residents who had tried to ride out the storm were frantically waving for rescue from their rooftops. A spokesman for the Coast Guard said that more than 1,200 people had been taken to safety by boat and helicopter on Monday and \"thousands today.\"\n\nThe secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, said the primary focus of the federal rescue effort was still on search and rescue. \"Rescuing people who are stranded is the most pressing problem,\" Mr. Chertoff said. \"We're racing the clock in terms of possible injury. We're racing the clock in terms of illness, and we're racing the clock to get them food and water.\"\n\nKatrina, one of the most devastating storms ever to hit the United States, has caused at least 70 deaths, by some estimates, in Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida, which it hit late last week, with officials saying they fear the final toll will be higher. But even as the storm was reduced to a tropical depression late today, now centered in Tennessee, its effects continued to threaten the Gulf Coast region.\n\nPreliminary reports on Monday put the overall death toll in Louisiana and Mississippi at 55, and officials could not provide firm updated numbers today. Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi said that the death toll in just one county in his state could be as high as 80.\n\nThe toll in economic damage appeared to be staggering. AIR Worldwide, a risk assessment firm, offered an estimate of cost to insurance companies of $17 billion to $25 billion.\n\nIn New Orleans, until last night a popular, carefree tourist destination, officials said the widespread flooding could get worse if damage to the city's protective levees was not repaired soon.\n\nAlthough flooding was shallow in some places, in others it was much as 20 feet, and city officials were telling people to get out, saying the municipal government itself was relocating to Baton Rouge.\n\nRising water was even invading the Superdome, where some 10,000 people had sought refuge as Katrina bore down on the city. It could be weeks before the city's 466,000 residents and countless business owners and tourists are allowed back in.\n\nThe flooding in New Orleans was the result of large breach in a levee on a canal that keeps the waters of Lake Pontchartrain out of the city. The hole, at the 17th Street flood wall, is at least 100 yards long and officials say it may be getting bigger.\n\nThe United States Army Corps of Engineers was trying to plug the gap by using helicopters to drop huge sandbags - each weighing 3,000 pounds - into the breech.\n\nNew Orleans lies mostly below sea level and is protected by a network of pumps, canals and levees. But many of the pumps were not working this morning. CNN reported that the storm caused another breach at Industrial Canal, and that corps officials feared another gap forming near Pumping Station No. 6.\n\nThe water coming through the first gap gushed into residential areas and moved down into the center of the city toward the Mississippi River, but so far, the French Quarter was dry. Other hazards arose.\n\n\"The looting is out of control - the French Quarter has been attacked,\" a New Orleans councilwoman, Jackie Clarkson, told The A.P. \"We're using exhausted, scarce police to control looting when they should be used for search and rescue.\"\n\nDeputy Police Chief Warren Riley told the news agency said that in one case, a looter shot and wounded another looter.\n\nMore than 1,600 Mississippi national guardsmen were activated to help with the recovery, and the Alabama Guard planned to send two battalions to Mississippi, The A.P. reported.\n\nThe White House said President Bush would curtail his vacation in Texas by two days and return to Washington on Wednesday to deal with the recovery effort, even as the Pentagon was about to announce that it was organizing a military task force to help officials in the affected areas with rescue efforts and law enforcement.\n\nAs dawn broke today, rescuers set out in boats and helicopters to search for survivors. A reporter who accompanied Jefferson Parish sheriff's rescue officials on a flight over the area saw floodwaters reaching to the eaves of some three-story houses. Hundreds of people trapped on roofs waved frantically for rescue. Coast Guard and police Blackhawk helicopters were plucking them off one by one.\n\n\"The devastation down there is just enormous,\" Governor Barbour of Mississippi said on the NBC \"Today\" show. \"I hate to say it, but it looks like it is a very bad disaster in terms of human life,\" he added, referring to Harrison County, which includes Gulfport and Biloxi.\n\n\"This is our tsunami,\" Mayor A. J. Holloway of Biloxi told The Biloxi Sun Herald.\n\nThe entire city of New Orleans was ordered evacuated before the storm, and Mayor Nagin said about 80 percent of the city's residents had left. But today, even as rescuers continued to search for victims, other officials had to deal with looters. CNN showed images of hundreds of people breaking into stores on Canal Street, at the edge of the French Quarter, and running away with bagloads of merchandise, with no one stopping them.\n\nOfficials at the Louisiana Office of Homeland Security said today that presidents of Plaquemines and Jefferson Parishes, which include New Orleans, as well as other communities throughout the state, had sought the imposition of martial law, which would suspend certain civil rights. Officials were awaiting direction from the attorney general's office.\n\nPresident Bush, in a televised news conference in San Diego, urged people in the affected areas to listen to instructions from state and federal authorities, who he said were working to \"get people back on their feet - we have a lot of work to do.\"\n\n\"These are trying times for the people of these communities,\" Mr. Bush said. \"We know that many are anxious to return to their homes. It's not possible at this moment. Right now our priority is on saving lives, and we are still in the midst of search and rescue operations.\"\n\nAround midday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Katrina had been reduced to a tropical depression, with maximum sustained winds of 35 miles per hour, and was centered near Clarksville, Tenn., just northwest of Nashville. It continued to cause flooding as it made its way north.\n\nIn Diamondhead, Miss., in a grim scene that is probably being repeated in countless other places nearby, the fire department was going door to door this morning to search for survivors. If they found no victims, members of the Fire and Rescue team painted large C's on the front doors of buildings, many of which were barely standing.\n\nMany people had fled to this community, about 60 miles northeast of New Orleans, thinking they were reaching higher safer ground that would keep them out of harm's way. Instead, many were caught in Katrina's surge that pushed through Bay St. Louis on the Gulf Coast and into the bayous, forcing water to the top of second-story homes in Diamondhead.\n\nRelatives of Rhea M. Finnila, 84, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, had brought her up to the attic of her son's home in Diamondhead, hoping to keep her safe, but the floodwaters that reached almost to the eaves of the house nearly carried her away on the mattress on which her family had placed her.\n\n\"When the surge came, the mattress was floating most of the time,\" said Rich L. Finnila, 59, a relative. \"It was a struggle to get her in there.\"\n\nBrian P. Finnila, Mrs. Finnila's grandson, said, \"We started climbing and pushing.\"\n\nAfter the storm, fire and rescue workers who found them used a blanket to carry Mrs. Finnila out of the house and then loaded her in the back of a Jeep to take her to another relative's house.\n\nJeff G. Garth, 34, and his family, from Waveland, which is on the coast, sought refuge in Diamondhead with his sister-in-law, Tammy L. Lick, 35, who had bought her home only a month ago.\n\nThe house did not survive Katrina.\n\n\"The whole house is gone - everything in it,\" Ms. Lick said. \"They told us we needed wind and hail insurance, but [that] we didn't flood here. Little did we know.\"\n\nYet no one was injured.\n\nIn New Orleans, a survey team was sent to inspect an overflowing canal that was adding to already flooded areas, Lt. Kevin Cowan of the National Guard, serving in the Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness, said in a telephone interview this morning. The assumption is that the canal is \"simply overflowing,\" he said, but the team will also look for possible breeches in the levee system.\n\nA total of more than 2.1 million people have reported power outages in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, the United States Department of Energy said.\n\nScott Adcock, public information manager with the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, said in a telephone interview that more than 790,000 people were without power. Authorities are starting damage assessment today with helicopters and people on the ground, but flooding and debris are hampering efforts in some areas, he said.\n\nAbout 66 shelters are now holding 5,300 people, and four medical-needs shelters are holding 36, he said, adding \"We are dealing with widespread power outages.\"\n\n\"The serious flooding is in Baldwin and Mobile counties,\" Mr. Adcock said. \"Some people were rescued in boats, but there are no confirmed reports of casualties directly related to the hurricane.\"\n\n\"We are looking at trees down, power lines down,\" he said.

            "text": "The French Quarter Picks Up After Katrina\n\nThe Gulf Coast wakes up this morning to assess the damage from Hurricane Katrina. Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco says several hundred people have been rescued in boats from rooftops and attics. New Orleans was spared the catastrophic flooding that many had feared. Still, many streets and buildings are swamped and filled with debris.\n\nCopyright ¬© 2005 NPR. For personal, noncommercial use only. See Terms of Use. For other uses, prior permission required.\n\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Steve Inskeep is on vacation. I'm Renee Montagne.\n\nAuthorities say dozens of people are dead and more than a million without power in the path of flooding and destruction left by Hurricane Katrina. Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco says several hundred people have been rescued in boats from rooftops, attics and other locations.\n\nGovernor KATHLEEN BLANCO (Louisiana): Katrina is by no means over. Wherever you live, it is still too dangerous for people to return home. If you evacuated and you're in a shelter, if you're with friends and family, please, please stay there. Stay safe. The roads are flooded. The power is out. The phones are down and there is no food or water, and many trees are down. So chances are, if you try to come in, you wouldn't be able to get your vehicle through anyway.\n\nAlong the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama massive rescue and recovery operations are under way. Katrina has been downgraded to a tropical storm and it's dumped heavy rains as it moves north. Experts say the extent of the damage won't be known for days. There are reports that many of the fatalities were from Harrison County, Mississippi, which includes Gulfport and Biloxi.\n\nNew Orleans was spared the catastrophic flooding that many had feared, but the damage is heavy. Streets and buildings are flooded and riddled with debris. NPR's John Burnett is in New Orleans and visited its famous French Quarter where the cleanup has already begun.\n\nThe French Quarter has always had a built-in advantage when a hurricane approaches. It sits on a slightly elevated piece of land beside the Mississippi River. Though 140-mile-per-hour winds came roaring into the narrow streets of the Quarter yesterday morning, the historic houses with their wrought-iron balconies and potted ferns, sustained relatively little damage. Most debris in the streets came from trees uprooted and limbs snapped by the gales.\n\nYesterday afternoon, as the sun briefly appeared between the receding hurricane clouds, neighbors Winston Gray and Carolyn Crack(ph) sat on the front stoop of his bungalow on upper Bourbon Street.\n\nMr. WINSTON GRAY (New Orleans Resident): I think we really were fortunate. We've lost some shingles off of the new roofs that we got after the last hurricane, and we lost some shingles there. I lost a tree in my courtyard.\n\nMs. CAROLYN CRACK (New Orleans Resident): I didn't believe the water would be high in the Quarter, and I wasn't worried about anything else because these buildings speak for themselves. They've been here all these years.\n\nBURNETT: It's all intact mostly: Cafe Du Monde with its green and white awning, Central Grocery, home of the original muffuletta sandwich; Tujague's Restaurant, the Cornstalk hotel, even the She Bar(ph) on Bourbon; they all came through relatively unscathed.\n\nThough certainly not every house in the Quarter had good news. Terry Bloothe(ph), a funeral home employee who was sitting forlornly on a cement step, said his apartment is a total loss.\n\nMr. TERRY BLOOTHE (New Orleans Resident): We live on a third-story. It blew out all of our windows and then it tore out the Sheetrock and then the insulation came out, and then it was water, insulation and mud and it destroyed everything we owned.\n\nBURNETT: So what will he do now?\n\nMr. BLOOTHE: Throw it away and start over, I guess.\n\nBURNETT: The sound you hear behind me are the big industrial generators that are powering the hotels and emergency crews here in downtown New Orleans. This city of half a million remains without power. It could be many weeks before all the neighborhoods are reconnected. All 10 local hospitals are reportedly running on emergency generators. Drinkable water is also a problem. The lack of power has made it impossible to get water pressure in some areas of the city, and in others the authorities have asked residents if they can get tap water to boil it before they drink it.\n\nOf all the neighborhoods in New Orleans, the Quarter was one of the first to begin to return to normal yesterday. Even though electricity is a distant dream, some bars have reopened to sell iced beer to fend off the tropical heat and restore the city's joie de vivre.\n\nUnidentified Man #1: Come on now!\n\nBURNETT: A group of men standing on a balcony overlooking Bourbon Street were well along on their post-hurricane party.\n\nDown on Canal Street the storm had uprooted dozens of palm trees planted by a casino and pushed over others at crazy angles. The street was littered with broken glass and, above, curtains fluttered out of gaping windows. The median was full of police cars and uniformed officers meant to discourage anyone from venturing into the shops whose windows were shattered in the storm.\n\nFreeman Speers(ph), with the Orleans Levee District Police Department, tried to do his job and not think about what lay ahead for him. His house is located in east New Orleans where police say many, many homes, perhaps hundreds, were inundated by flood waters.\n\nOfficer FREEMAN SPEERS (Orleans Levee District Police Department): My house has about eight feet of water in it, but my family is safe and that's all that counts. And I'm out here trying to help other people and stop the looters.\n\nBURNETT: Among the biggest losses in the French Quarter are the magnificent live oaks and magnolias in front of and behind the stately old St. Louis Cathedral on Jackson Square. Patricia Harris is a retired teacher. She says she was walking by and surveying the damage when she made a remarkable discovery.\n\nMs. PATRICIA HARRIS (Retired Teacher): Behind the main cathedral in the city, giant ancient oak trees were uprooted. There's a statue of Jesus and the trees fell around him. He was not touched.\n\nBURNETT: By late yesterday afternoon, the streets of downtown New Orleans were filling up with sightseers, though police have not lifted their dusk-to-dawn curfew. Many streets are still impassable because of downed trees, power lines and traffic lights. There is still no word about when New Orleanians can start going home.

center said 30 people were found dead in an apartment complex in biloxi seven others were found in the industrial seaway a canal that runs from the gulf to the back bay hurricane katrina was potent enough to rank as one of the most punishing hurricanes ever to hit the united states insurance experts said that damage could exceed 9 billion which would make it one of the costliest storms on record in new orleans most of the levees held but one was damaged flood waters rose to rooftops in one neighborhood the hurricanes howling winds stripped 15foot sections off the roof of the superdome where as many as 10000 evacuees were sheltered some of the worst damage reports came from east of the historic city of new orleans with an estimated 40000 homes reported flooded in st bernard parish in gulfport the storm left three of five hospitals without working emergency rooms beachfront homes wrecked and major stretches of the coastal highway flooded and unpassable it came on mississippi like a ton of bricks the states governor haley barbour told a midday news conference its a terrible storm president bush promised extensive assistance for hurricane victims and the federal emergency management agency was expected to be working in the area for months assessing damage to properties and allocating what is likely to ultimately be billions of dollars in aide to homeowners and businesses in alabama louisiana and mississippi the governors declared search and rescue their top priority but said that high waters and strong winds were keeping them from that task particularly in the hardesthit areas the governors sent out the police and the national guard after reports of looting and officials in some parts of louisiana said they would impose a curfew hurricane katrina was downgraded from category 5 the worst possible storm to category 4 as it hit land in eastern louisiana just after 6 am and in new orleans officials said the storms slight shift to the east had spared them somewhat the city is below sea level and there had been predictions that the historic french quarter would be under 18 or 20 feet of water still no one was finding much comfort here with 100 mph winds and water surges of up to 15 feet officials said early in the day that more than 20 buildings had been toppled i cant say that weve escaped the worst said gov kathleen babineaux blanco i think there is still damage that can be inflicted on the city we dont even know what the worst is preliminary damage estimates from hurricane katrina which raked across southern florida last week as a category 1 hurricane before reaching the warm waters of the gulf of mexico and making its run at the gulf coast ranged from 9 billion to 16 billion only hurricane andrew which ripped through parts of florida louisiana and mississippi in august 1992 was costlier with nearly 21 billion in insured losses beyond the property damage caused by flooding and the high winds hurricane katrina also dealt a blow to the oil industry and the lucrative casinos that have been the economic engine for the region both oil production on offshore platforms and gambling in the string of casinos that dot the mississippi gulf coast shut down on sunday as the storm approached the evacuations cut oil production by more than 600000 barrels a day closing the casinos cost the state 400000 to 500000 a day in lost tax revenue alone and mr barbour said officials had not yet been able to determine the extent of damager to the casinos the storm pounded new orleans for eight hours straight flooding overwhelmed the levees built to protect the city from the mississippi river and lake pontchartrain sending muddy water swirling into the narrow and meandering streets downtown along the lake there were snapped telephone poles trees blocking roads and live wires scattered over the roads in one cabin a family was cooking a chicken dinner over charcoal briquettes on a hibachi they had lost power like everyone else in the area and wide stretches of lowlands beyond the city were transformed into new lakes windows were blown off condominiums hotels office buildings and charity hospital sending chards of glass into the winds fires broke out despite torrential rain some ignited the authorities said by residents who lit candles after the electricity went out the storm knocked out telephone and cellular service across swaths of the gulf region and officials in new orleans said parts of the city could remain without power for weeks two nuclear plants near the path of hurricane katrina appear to have weathered the storm without major damage and a third shut down on saturday in anticipation of the hurricane according to entergy nuclear which owns all three the extent of damage to the plant that shut down waterford 20 miles west of new orleans was still unknown late monday afternoon because the wind was blowing too hard to go out and look said diane park a spokeswoman the more sparsely populated parishes east of new orleans meanwhile got hit much harder than anyone had expected ms blanco said that plaquemines orleans st bernard jefferson and st tammany parishes had been devastated by high winds and flood waters in st bernard the emergency center was complete submerged and officials estimated that 40000 homes too were flooded parish officials reported in early afternoon that many residents had been driven to their rooftops officials estimated that 80 percent of new orleans residents had obeyed the order to evacuate but in areas that were expecting less damage officials were worried and annoyed that large numbers of people had tried to ride out the storm to their peril in plaquemines and terrebonne parishes officials said they were particularly concerned about commercial fisherman who had decided to remain on their boats my biggest concern is the loss of life said state senator walter j boasso we have a lot of people down there hiding in their attics and i dont know if we will get to them fast enough in mississippi mr barbour said that many people suffered from what he called hurricane fatigue deciding not to evacuate this time after having done so in the past only to be spared we pray that those people are ok he said but we dont know in diamondhead miss don haller and his 17yearold son don jr were left clinging to the remains of their house when a 23foot surge of water hit it flexing the roof like a deck of cards they had decided against evacuating mr haller said judging the storm just a lot of rain we rode the house mr haller said emerging from the waters here his son carrying their dachshund kuddles mr barbour said that casinos along the coast near biloxi and gulfport had been hit by surges of more than 20 feet but casino workers could not reach them to survey the damage he said because highway 90 had essentially been destroyed along the coast in mobile ala 130 miles east of new orleans thousands of evacuees from mississippi and louisiana were filling shelters and the hotels that had remained open the lowestlying areas of mobile and baldwin counties in alabama were evacuated on sunday night by noon areas south of interstate 10 were already flooding and the storm surge was pushing the water toward the city of mobile and mobile bay as the hurricane progressed downtown mobile which is right on the bay was severely flooded by monday afternoon the water pushing down the main streets around the county courthouse and lapping at the sandbagged doors and windows at the mobile museum water all but covered a number of street signs and parking meters and large heavy planters and some newspaper boxes floated down the streets the main hotels in the city were just a block or two from the worst flooding causing concerns that they too would be flooded at least in the main floors and as power and phone lines went down evacuees were getting restless paul weir said he had not left his home in meraux la just outside new orleans during a storm since hurricane betsy in 1965 and left on sunday morning only after hearing that hurricane katrina was a category 5 he drove with his wife daughter and four friends to mobile with roads clogged with other residents fleeing what is normally a threehour drive took 12 by monday afternoon the family was obsessing about what they would find when they got home if i was home i

a 2000 limit at the ramada hotel in downtown mobile edith frieson sat anxiously in a soggy room wondering why her husband had not returned he left maybe three hours ago to go down and see if he could check the house said mrs frieson who lives on dauphin island a narrow barrier island south of mobile the island was already flooding on sunday afternoon like most storms hurricane katrina weakened as it came onshore and by monday evening the national hurricane center had downgraded it to a tropical storm the center of the storm had moved its heavy rains toward jackson miss but state officials said the hurricane had been an unusually large one causing a wide swath of damage and they expected to be dealing with damage for days if not weeks in louisiana ms blanco pleaded with residents who had evacuated not to rush back the roads are flooded the power is out the phones are down and there is no food or water and many trees are down she said wherever you live it is still too dangerous for people to return home she continued if you evacuated and youre in a shelter if youre with friends and family please please stay there stay safe michael d brown the director of the federal emergency management agency reminded people that most injuries from hurricanes occurred after the storm had passed be careful mr brown said standing next to the governor at a news conference dont get in that water watch for downed power lines if youre going to use a chainsaw know how to use a chainsaw if youre going to have a generator know how to exercise and operate the generator be very very careful the storm is not over mr brown also discouraged fire and emergency agencies outside the storm area from sending in crews unless they had been asked even before the hurricane hit the new orleans area fema had positioned 23 of its disaster medical assistance teams and 7 search and rescue teams around the region it also delivered generators and stockpiles of water ice and readytoeat meals it even

Emergency workers feared that they would find more dead among people believed to be trapped underwater and in collapsed buildings.\n\nJim Pollard, a spokesman for the Harrison County emergency operations center, said 30 people were found dead in an apartment complex in Biloxi. Seven others were found in the Industrial Seaway, a canal that runs from the Gulf to the Back Bay.\n\nHurricane Katrina was potent enough to rank as one of the most punishing hurricanes ever to hit the United States. Insurance experts said that damage could exceed $9 billion, which would make it one of the costliest storms on record.\n\nIn New Orleans, most of the levees held, but one was damaged. Flood waters rose to rooftops in one neighborhood. The hurricane's howling winds stripped 15-foot sections off the roof of the Superdome, where as many as 10,000 evacuees were sheltered.\n\nSome of the worst damage reports came from east of the historic city of New Orleans with an estimated 40,000 homes reported flooded in St. Bernard Parish. In Gulfport, the storm left three of five hospitals without working emergency rooms, beachfront homes wrecked and major stretches of the coastal highway flooded and unpassable.\n\n\"It came on Mississippi like a ton of bricks,\" the state's governor, Haley Barbour, told a midday news conference \"It's a terrible storm.\"\n\nPresident Bush promised extensive assistance for hurricane victims and the Federal Emergency Management Agency was expected to be working in the area for months, assessing damage to properties and allocating what is likely to ultimately be billions of dollars in aide to homeowners and businesses.\n\nIn Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi, the governors declared search and rescue their top priority, but said that high waters and strong winds were keeping them from that task, particularly in the hardest-hit areas.\n\nThe governors sent out the police and the National Guard after reports of looting, and officials in some parts of Louisiana said they would impose a curfew.\n\nHurricane Katrina was downgraded from Category 5 - the worst possible storm - to Category 4 as it hit land in eastern Louisiana just after 6 a.m., and in New Orleans, officials said the storm's slight shift to the east had spared them somewhat.

Officials said early in the day that more than 20 buildings had been toppled. \"I can't say that we've escaped the worst,\" said Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco. \"I think there is still damage that can be inflicted on the city.

(Contact 504-587-9818 or Screenwriter @ Me.com) My Katrina screenplay and book are creative non-fiction based on real-life events captured by myself on 200 hours of video, 30,000 photographs, and over 100 interviews, most recorded as it was happening those first days and months of the storm. The book is nearing completion, and the screenplay is finished. The works have the - often exclusive - major cooperation of local first responders and residents from all aspects and areas of the storm. I've spent 4 years on it, and it will be the only screenplay telling the true stories of the storm from all angles.\n\nNEW ORLEANS ‚Äî More than six years after Hurricane Katrina's rampage, authorities have taken only halting steps toward identifying weaknesses in a nationwide patchwork of levees intended to protect millions of Americans' lives and property during potentially catastrophic floods. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, accused of building substandard levees and floodwalls that failed when Katrina swamped the Gulf Coast in 2005, has spent $56 million since then developing the initial phase of a national levee inventory as required by Congress. The Corps on Thursday was releasing a database with information about nearly 14,000 miles of levees under its jurisdiction. But the inventory doesn't include what is believed to be more than 100,000 additional miles of levees not covered by the Corps' safety program.

A clear change in tone appeared to happen in Springsteen following what he saw in New Orleans and it was certainly understandable. It was the first time that government appeared to not care what happened to its own citizens.

In all, more than 1,700 people were killed and hundreds of thousands of others displaced. Packing 145-mile-an-hour winds as it made landfall, the category 3 storm left more than a million people in three states without power and submerged highways even hundreds of miles from its center.

Others to come include Kermit Ruffins, Donald Harrison Jr., Davis Rogan and Susan Spicer. Here is an interview in which co-creator David Simon discusses his process in building the ‚ÄúTreme‚Äù characters from some of these real people. All of the posts will eventually be combined into a longer piece for the Times-Picayune, so consider them a work in progress.

The series premiered on April 11, 2010, and concluded on December 29, 2013, comprising four seasons and 36 episodes. It takes its name from Trem√©, a neighborhood of New Orleans.[1] The series begins three months after Hurricane Katrina as the residents, including musicians, chefs, Mardi Gras Indians, and other New Orleanians, try to rebuild their lives, their homes and their unique culture in the aftermath of the 2005 hurricane.[1][2][3]\n\nBlue Velvet is an online digital history project about the city of New Orleans both before and after Hurricane Katrina. The project was published in the fifth issue of Vectors Journal of Culture and Technology in a Dynamic Vernacular, entitled \"Difference.\" The full title of the project is \"Blue Velvet: Redressing New Orleans in Katrina's Wake.\" Blue Velvet was created through the collaboration of David Theo Goldberg, Director of the University of California Humanities Research Institute (UCHRI), and a graduate research assistant, Stefka Hristova. These two were assisted in the implementation of the site by the digital artist and designer Erik Loyer, currently creative director of the journal. Blue Velvet was conceived as a multimedia presentation of a journal article which Goldberg had previously published, \"Deva-stating Disasters: Race in the Shadow(s) of New Orleans\"[1] and which had been noticed by Tara McPherson, one of the founding editors of Vectors.
