            "text": "'They're Killing Us': The Disturbing Rise of the Islamic State The Islamic State is conquering cities in Syria and Iraq with disturbing frequency and tens of thousands of Christians and Yazidis are fleeing. The US has begun air strikes, but the Islamists are benefiting from instability in both countries. With the exception of a few birds defying the sweltering midday heat, all is quiet on the front, with Kurdish fighters cowering in the shade of the cliffs. Suddenly, sentence fragments from Friday prayers can be heard on the banks of the Euphrates River. \"Gather together ... smash the traitors of the faith!\" The words from the preacher, distorted by the amplifiers so loved by the jihadists, sound almost spooky. Down along the river, the jihadists with the Islamic State (IS) gather together for the next attack. A few hundred meters above on the sparse, sun-drenched hills, the Kurds are sitting, feeling like they've somehow ended up on the set of a horror film. \"What do they want from us,\" asks one young fighter who only a few weeks ago still worked as a cashier in a supermarket. \"These madmen keep on attacking and they continue to come at us even after they've been shot. I hit one of them twice. He only stopped after he was shot in the head. They're insane. They come here to die.\" Koban�, known as Ayn al-Arab in Arabic, is a small Kurdish enclave in northern Syria located on the border with Turkey. Since January it has been under siege by IS because Koban� is located directly in the middle of the terrorist militia's self-declared caliphate. Throughout the entire month of July, every three to four days, up to a thousand militiamen armed with tanks, anti-aircraft guns and mortars would attack Kurds entrenched in the hills. The only reason they have been able to withstand the onslaught is that they began digging protective trenches and building bunkers with cement ceilings earlier this year. The front lines here today evoke those of World War I. But at the beginning of August, following the deaths of around 100 fighters on the Kurdish side and 500 on that of the IS, this front in northern Syria suddenly grew quiet. Strangely quiet, the besieged locals felt -- before realizing that the main jihadist force had moved around 300 Kilometers (186 miles) to the east into northern Iraq. After a long period of relative quiet, the IS fighters then surprised residents with a major offensive. Within just days, they had overrun Iraqi cities that had been protected by Kurdish peshmerga fighters. First they took the city of Sinjar, located west of Mosul near the Syrian border. Then they took the Christian city of Qaraqosh and Bartella near Mosul. By Friday, some of the fighters were within 30 kilometers of Erbil, the capital of the Iraqi Kurdistan region. For the international community, the swiftness with which the peshmerga were forced to retreat came unexpectedly, as did the mass exodus triggered by the IS fighters. Over 100,000 people tried to flee to safety last week. The rapid advance compelled the United States, 11 years after the start of the Iraq war and almost three years after the official withdrawal of troops, to once again intervene militarily over the weekend. F/A-18 fighter jets and drones conducted targeted air strikes in northern Iraq, using laser-guided bombs against mobile artillery used by the Islamic State in order to halt the fighters' advance on Erbil. Secretary of State John Kerry accused the Islamists of \"targeted acts of violence\" that \"bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide\" and must be prevented. Following the dramatic news and photos of the fleeing Yazidis and Christians, the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the developments. IS fighters had already arrived in Sinjar a week ago Sunday. The city is the stronghold in Iraq for Yazidis, an ancient, pre-Muslim religious community, with roots in Zoroastrianism, whose members worship seven angels, including a peacock angel, in addition to god. Radical Muslims have persecuted them as \"devil worshippers.\" Kurdish troops defended the city for several hours before running out of ammunition. Reports that IS fighters had killed hundreds, or even more than a thousand, of Yazidis could not be confirmed. But fear is widespread, the consequence of barbaric photos and videos posted by the Islamic State in the Internet, some showing shot or beheaded victims. They are turning their reputation for cruelty into a weapon. Residents fled in long columns of vehicles to the Kurdish cities of Dohuk and Erbil, located around 200 kilometers to the east. But not all made it out. Those without vehicles or who waited too long to make their escape made it as far as the nearby mountains, arid crags devoid of food and water. Last week, thousands were holding out there, besieged by the jihadists. \"There are 700 families here and the first six people have already died of thirst,\" Khoder Darwish Suliman, the father of a fleeing Yazidi family said by mobile phone, describing the situation. \"Three were children. There is no water here, nothing to eat, absolutely nothing.\" He said people were too afraid to return to their homes. \"They're killing us,\" he said. On Friday, aircraft from the US and elsewhere began dropping humanitarian aid supplies over the mountains as the Iraqi air force had previously done. By then, Suliman could no longer be reached by phone. The situation in Qaraqosh, a Christian city located 30 kilometers from Mosul, has also changed dramatically in the past week. Some 40,000 Christians lived in the city, which is home to 12 churches and a mosque. In June, a SPIEGEL reporter traveled to Qaraqosh and told the story of Salam Kihkhwa, a 31-year-old Catholic. The small house at the entrance to the city where he lived with his parents now stands empty. The family fled at 8 p.m. last Thursday. It was the moment at which the jihadists finally occupied Qaraqosh. In the days prior, Salam had been posting horror stories on Facebook from nearby towns, sent to him by friends. And the IS had also been intimidating Qaraqosh residents, cutting off electricity and water supplies. \"I don't want to become a refugee and have to live in another country for years,\" he wrote. He added that he and his family had wanted to remain in their hometown for as long as possible. 'Flight Or Death Is the Only Choice' On Friday morning, Salam told his own story be phone from Erbil. His voice was shaky from exhaustion and lack of sleep. He said that on Friday, a shell struck near his house, Salam saw dust rise, heard people scream and could then see them running away. \"We heard heavy fighting the whole day,\" he says. Hours later, the streets had emptied completely. The Kurdish peshmerga did all they could to hold on to the city. \"We were so scared we could hardly breathe,\" Salam says. As the first Kurdish fighters began to retreat in resignation that evening, people began leaving their homes. Salam and his parents also squeezed into a car together with their neighbors. Tens of thousands fled Qaraqosh. It would take them several hours to make the 30-kilometer trip to Erbil. Salam is now living together with seven other families at his cousin's place in the Kurdish capital. He says that many Iraqi Christians have now been left homeless. He has since spoken to acquaintances who hid in Qaraqosh's only mosque. IS militants, they said, have raised the black flag in the city and ordered all remaining Christians to leave. \"Flight or death is the only choice we have,\" Salam says. On Friday, the British government advised its citizens to leave Erbil because of the advance of the IS and due to concern that the peshmerga would soon run out of ammunition. As early as June, the Kurdish fighters had been ordered only to fire at nearby attackers because of the shortage. Those concerns, however, may now be easing after it was reported that the US has begun directly providing weapons and munitions to the peshmerga. The US is also considering possible ways to evacuate those trapped in the mountains outside Qaraqosh. Initially, the IS attacks in June provided the Kurds with the opportunity to take areas that they viewed to be Kurdish. Now, though, it means they have a front line with the jihadists that is almost 1,000 kilometers long. In an interview with the Washington Post at the end of July, Masrour Barzani, the Kurdistan Regional Government's intelligence and security chief, said the Kurds had asked the US for assistance but had gotten \"not a single bullet. This is the truth that the world should know. So we are left out to fight all these terrorists, all these problems on our own.\" US air strikes on IS positions over the weekend and into Monday -- along with the weapons deliveries indicate that is now changing. But the IS \"caliphate,\" which it declared at the end of June, now stretches from the steppe between Marea and Al-Bab in northwestern Syria to an around 100 kilometers outside of Baghdad. Almost the entire border between the two countries is under the control of the IS. And while the IS may be reminiscent of al-Qaida and earlier jihadist groups in terms of its propaganda, there is a significant difference. The IS acts strategically and with a clear goal: to bring as much land, money, people, weapons and infrastructure as possible under its control. The radicals have profited from the months-long stalemate among various political factions in Iraq. It has been made worse by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's unwillingness to step down, despite a parliamentary majority demand that he do so. That has hindered the creation of a new government in Baghdad. With a sectarian agenda backed by Iran aimed at bringing the country under Shiite control, Al-Maliki has incensed both Sunni Arabs and Kurds in the north of the country. On Monday, Maliki even deployed elite security forces in Baghdad, underscoring his demands that the country's new president name him to form a new government. The IS advance would hardly be possible without support from Iraqi Sunnis. Indeed, former US advisor Ali Khedery says the disillusioned Sunnis have \"chosen to consummate a deal with the devil.\" IS commandos, after all, haven't been picky about who they attack. In Mosul, former military officers and Baath Party bigwigs from the era of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, have been arrested or have disappeared without a trace. In Tikrit, leaders of aligned Sunni Islamists like the Naqshbandi Army have been intimidated or murdered. US President Barack Obama had been eager to avoid intervention in Iraq absent a new government in Baghdad. But the American air strikes on IS positions still won't solve the fundamental conflicts in these two countries -- conflicts that paved the way for the meteoric rise of the IS in the first place. For some time now, the lack of strong governments in Iraq and Syria has allowed the IS to operate freely in large swaths of the region. The world, this week, is watching. But it continues to ignore what is happening in northern Syria. The IS is continuing its seige of Koban� and the Turks have sealed the border to Kurds attempting to flee. At the same time, Turkish officials are doing hardly anything to hinder jihadists who travel in and out of Turkish airports as they make their way into the region.",

Throughout the entire month of July, every three to four days, up to a thousand militiamen armed with tanks, anti-aircraft guns and mortars would attack Kurds entrenched in the hills. Their only reason they have been able to withstand the onslaught is that they began digging protective trenches and building bunkers with cement ceilings earlier this year. The front lines here today evoke those of World War I.\n\nBut at the beginning of August, following the deaths of around 100 fighters on the Kurdish side and 500 on that of the IS, this front in northern Syria suddenly grew quiet. Strangely quiet, the besieged locals felt — before realizing that the main jihadist force had moved around 300 Kilometers (186 miles) to the east into northern Iraq.\n\nAfter a long period of relative quiet, the IS fighters then surprised residents with a major offensive. Within just days, they had overrun Iraqi cities that had been protected by Kurdish peshmerga fighters. First they took the city of Sinjar, located west of Mosul near the Syrian border. Then they took the Christian city of Qaraqosh and Bartella near Mosul. By Friday, some of the fighters were within 30 kilometers of Erbil, the capital of the Iraqi Kurdistan region.\n\nFor the international community, the swiftness with which the peshmerga were forced to retreat came unexpectedly, as did the mass exodus triggered by the IS fighters. Over 100,000 people tried to flee to safety last week.\n\nThe rapid advance compelled the United States, 11 years after the start of the Iraq war and almost three years after the official withdrawal of troops, to once again intervene militarily over the weekend. F/A-18 fighter jets and drones conducted targeted air strikes in northern Iraq, using laser-guided bombs against mobile artillery used by the Islamic State in order to halt the fighters’ advance on Erbil. Secretary of State John Kerry accused the Islamists of “targeted acts of violence” that “bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide” and must be prevented. Following the dramatic news and photos of the fleeing Yazidis and Christians, the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the developments.\n\nIS fighters had already arrived in Sinjar a week ago Sunday. The city is the stronghold in Iraq for Yazidis, an ancient, pre-Muslim religious community, with roots in Zoroastrianism, whose members worship seven angels, including a peacock angel, in addition to god. Radical Muslims have persecuted them as “devil worshippers.”\n\nKurdish troops defended the city for several hours before running out of ammunition. Reports that IS fighters had killed hundreds, or even more than a thousand, Yazidis could not be confirmed. But fear is widespread, the consequence of barbaric photos and videos posted by the Islamic State in the Internet, some showing shot or beheaded victims. They are turning their reputation for cruelty into a weapon.\n\nResidents fled in long columns of vehicles to the Kurdish cities of Dohuk and Erbil, located around 200 kilometers to the east. But not all made it out. Those without vehicles or who waited too long to make their escape on made it as far as the nearby mountains, arid crags devoid of food and water.\n\nLast week, thousands were holding out there, besieged by the jihadists. “There are 700 families here and the first six people have already died of thirst,” Khoder Darwish Suliman, the father of a fleeing Yazidi family said by mobile phone, describing the situation. “Three were children. There is no water here, nothing to eat, absolutely nothing.” He said people were too afraid to return to their homes. “They’re killing us,” he said. On Friday, aircraft from the US and elsewhere began dropping humanitarian aid supplies over the mountains as the Iraqi air force had previously done. By then, Suliman could no longer be reached by phone.\n\nThe situation in Qaraqosh, a Christian city located 30 kilometers from Mosul, has also changed dramatically in the past week. Some 40,000 Christians lived in the city, which is home to 12 churches and a mosque. In June, a SPIEGEL reporter traveled to Qaraqosh and told the story of Salam Kihkhwa, a 31-year-old Catholic. The small house at the entrance to the city where he lived with his parents now stands empty. The family fled at 8 p.m. last Thursday. It was the moment at which the jihadists finally occupied Qaraqosh.\n\nIn the days prior, Salam had been posting horror stories on Facebook from nearby towns, sent to him by friends. And the IS had also been intimidating Qaraqosh residents, cutting off electricity and water supplies. “I don’t want to become a refugee and have to live in another country for years,” he wrote. He added that he and his family had wanted to remain intheir hometown for as long as possible.\n\n‘Flight Or Death Is the Only Choice’\n\nOn Friday morning, Salam told his own story be phone from Erbil. His voice was shaky from exhaustion and lack of sleep. He said that on Friday, a shell struck near his house, Salam saw dust rise, heard people scream and could then see them running away. “We heard heavy fighting the whole day,” he says. Hours later, the streets had emptied completely. The Kurdish peshmerga did all they could to hold on to the city. “We were so scared we could hardly breathe,” Salam says. As the first Kurdish fighters began to retreat in resignation that evening, people began leaving their homes. Salam and his parents also squeezed into a car together with their neighbors. Tens of thousands fled Qaraqosh. It would take them several hours to make the 30-kilometer trip to Erbil.\n\nSalam is now living together with seven other families at his cousin’s place in the Kurdish capital. He says that many Iraqi Christians have now been left homeless. He has since spoken to acquaintances who hid in Qaraqosh’s only mosque. IS militants, they said, have raised the black flag in the city and ordered all remaining Christians to leave. “Flight or death is the only choice we have,” Salam says.\n\nOn Friday, the British government advised its citizens to leave Erbil because of the advance of the IS and due to concern that the Peshmerga would soon run out of ammunition. As early as June, the Kurdish fighters had been ordered only to fire at nearby attackers because of the shortage. Those concerns, however, may now be easing after it was reported that the US has begun directly providing weapons and munitions to the Peshmerga. The US is also considering possible ways to evacuate those trapped in the mountains outside Qaraqosh.\n\nInitially, the IS attacks in June provided the Kurds with the opportunity to take areas that they viewed to be Kurdish. Now, though, it means they have a front line with the jihadists that is almost 1,000 kilometers long. In an interview with the Washington Post at the end of July, Masrour Barzani, the Kurdistan Regional Government’s intelligence and security chief, said the Kurds had asked the US for assistance but had gotten “not a single bullet. This is the truth that the world should know. So we are left out to fight all these terrorists, all these problems on our own.”\n\nUS air strikes on IS positions over the weekend and into Monday — along with the weapons deliveries indicate that is now changing. But the IS “caliphate,” which it declared at the end of June, now stretches from the steppe between Marea and Al-Bab in northwestern Syria to an around 100 kilometers outside of Baghdad. Almost the entire border between the two countries is under the control of the IS.\n\nAnd while the IS may be reminiscent of al-Qaida and earlier jihadist groups in terms of its propaganda, there is a significant difference. The IS acts strategically and with a clear goal: to bring as much land, money, people, weapons and infrastructure as possible under its control.\n\nThe radicals have profited from the months-long stalemate among various political factions in Iraq. It has been made worse by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s unwillingness to step down, despite a parliamentary majority demand that he do so. That has hindered the creation of a new government in Baghdad. With a sectarian agenda backed by Iran aimed at bringing the country under Shiite control, Al-Maliki has incensed both Sunni Arabs and Kurds in the north of the country. On Monday, Maliki even deployed elite security forces in Baghdad, underscoring his demands that the country’s new president name him to form a new government.\n\nThe IS advance would hardly be possible without support from Iraqi Sunnis. Indeed, former US advisor Ali Khedery says the disillusioned Sunnis have “chosen to consummate a deal with the devil.” IS commandos, after all, haven’t been picky about who they attack. In Mosul, former military officers and Baath Party bigwigs from the era of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, have been arrested or have disappeared without a trace. In Tikrit, leaders of aligned Sunni Islamists like the Naqshbandi Army have been intimidated or murdered.US President Barack Obama had been eager to avoid intervention in Iraq absent a new government in Baghdad. But the American air strikes on IS positions still won’t solve the fundamental conflicts in these two countries — conflicts that paved the way for the meteoric rise of the IS in the first place.\n\nFor some time now, the lack of strong governments in Iraq and Syria has allowed the IS to operate freely in large swaths of the region. The world, this week, is watching. But it continues to ignore what is happening in northern Syria. The IS is continuing its seige of Kobanê and the Turks have sealed the border to Kurds attempting to flee. At the same time, Turkish officials are doing hardly anything to hinder jihadists who travel in and out of Turkish airports as they make their way into the region.",

It has menaced Baghdad and is now within striking distance of Iraq’s two largest dams.\n\n“The situation is slowly tipping in their favour,” said Dr Hisham al-Hashimi, Iraq’s leading expert on Isis. “They won’t take the dam near Mosul, but Haditha [at the centre of Iraq's water and energy supply grid] will be very hard to defend.\n\n“They are very close to Baghdad airport. If they breached the perimeter, even with a symbolic attack, it would be enormous propaganda value for them.”\n\nIraq’s beleaguered military has been unable to muster a meaningful push back against the jihadists and is under intense pressure to support the Yazidis with air strikes and food drops. A series of spectacular defeats has seriously eroded its credibility. Baghdad claimed on Wednesday that its military had carried out an air strike on a Mosul prison which killed scores of jihadists and freed an unknown number of prisoners. The area was impossible to access and the numbers of fatalities could not be verified. However, witnesses reported damage to the prison and relatives rushed to the gates in the hope of rescuing detained family members.\n\nKurdish Peshmurga troops, long regarded as a more formidable fighting force, had been defending Sinjar, but they too were forced to withdraw as Isis advanced. Kurdish officials say their forces were seriously outgunned by the jihadists, who were using heavy weapons looted from Iraqi bases.\n\nThe same weapons are being used to consolidate Isis’s hold on much of western Iraq. The group has significantly boosted its numbers by tapping into Iraq’s estranged Sunni population, which has been marginalised by the Shia majority government since the US overthrow of Saddam Hussein more than 11 years ago.\n\n“I would say there are now between 30,000 and 50,000 of them,” Hashimi said. “Of those, I would say 30% are ideologues. The others have joined out of fear or coercion.”\n\nThe once dominant US military and powerful embassy now play next to no role in Iraq, with Iraqi militias reporting to Iranian generals increasingly taking the lead in the fight against the jihadists.\n\n“Iraq is spiralling out of control,” said Ali Khedery, the former longest-serving US official in Baghdad. “The centrifugal forces are spinning so quickly. They are on one timeline and Washington is on another. I am beyond concerned.”\n\nKhedery, who reported to five US ambassadors and three US central command generals and is now chairman of the Dubai-based consultancy Dragoman Partners, said: “Everybody is retreating to their corners. And there is no credible international actor that I can see that is trying to bring it together again.\n\n“It definitely is an existential threat to the Iraqi government and I think it represents yet another manifestation of the disintegration of Iraq as we know it.\n\n“Iranian overreach, the genocide in Syria, [Nouri] al-Maliki’s consolidation of power in a very sectarian way, have all led to the disillusionment, the disenfranchisement of the Sunni Arabs, who have fatally, but perhaps understandably, chosen to consummate a deal with the devil. Now we are locked in a race to the bottom.”",

weapons supplies to kurdish peshmerga forces with a more comprehensive plan underway to arm erbil the associated press reported it quoted unidentified us officials confirming the arms supplies and explaining they were not yet going through the pentagon historically it has been the cia that has done similar quiet arming operations the agency noted the supplies began as peshmerga forces appeared to be losing ground in recent weeks to the islamic armies on their southern border but the new arms – and us and iraqi air force air strikes on is positions – appear to be turning the tide again in favor of the kurds the move to directly aid the kurds underscores the level of us concern about the islamic state militants gains in the north and reflects the persistent administration view that the iraqis must take the necessary steps to solve their own security problems the ap said it reported that to bolster that effort the administration is also very close to approving plans for the pentagon to arm the kurds a senior official said in recent days the us military has been helping facilitate weapons deliveries from the iraqis to the kurds providing logistic assistance and transportation to the north according to the ap meanwhile the washington post quoted masrour barzani the krgs security chief as saying his forces are overstretched and calling for direct us military assistance saying erbil had been left alone to confront the extremists its a big responsibility its a long border many of our troops are there and we dont know how long the situation will continue barzani told the us daily in an interview we are really overstretched barzani revealed that the kurds are supposed to receive a share of ussupplied weapons to iraq but they have gotten not a single bullet meanwhile he said is fighters had seized weapons worth hundreds of millions of dollars from retreating iraqi soldiers this is the truth that the world should know he said so we are left out to fight all these

opposed efforts by the kurds to acquire weapons calling such sales illegal baghdad insists that only the central government is authorized to purchase arms but the post noted that the kurds have long pursued secret deals to replenish their stocks the newspaper reported that a recent move by baghdad to ban cargo flights landing at airports in kurdistan had squeezed the war effort because planes landing in erbil would bring in new weapons from eastern europe in washington brett mcgurk the obama administrations diplomatic advisor on iraq told lawmakers wednesday that weve had conversations with kurdish leaders about how we can work with them on their future but mcgurk the deputy assistant secretary of state for the near east made clear that the administration believes that the best way to go is for the kurdish region to stay inside iraqs constitutional framework i think the heart of every kurd wants an independent state mcgurk told the house foreign affairs committee i think we have to recognize that mcgurk did not directly address kurdish appeals for us weapons but he made clear that the administration does not support independent kurdish oil exports outside the central government framework we have an obligation to say when people ask that there is a legal risk for taking oil without an agreement with baghdad he said the ap reported meanwhile that the us administration is watching carefully as a political crisis brews in baghdad in the latest bickering in baghdad — which has continued through the two months that a third of the country has fallen to

about him how do i know this remember a few years back during the benefit for new orleans after katrina kanye went off script to deliver an impassioned plea to the people of america theyre killing us he said shortly before his famous george bush doesnt like black people he was in a state of moral outrage as he railed against the injustices of the federal response to katrina but as angry offended and outraged as he was then he says nothing can compare or ever will compare with how offended he was at being booed by a bonnarroo crowd angered because his show started almost 2 hours late on his website west wrote this is the most offended ive ever been this is the maddest i ever will be so let me get this straight kanye is more offended by being booed than by police shooting at looters in new orleans what a guy wednesday june 20 2007 bonnaroo pictures here are a few shots i took during bonnaroo they are all work safe my little corner of bonnaroo notice the truck tent which really saved space and made my camping significantly more comfortable the tall tent just to the right of my truck was my shower tent equipped with a battery operated pump and a propane water heater hot showers are a wonderful thing if id wanted to i probably could have paid for my whole trip by selling showers to other campers the interior view i built this setup over the last 4 years that my brother and i have been going to bristol for the races ive pretty much finished itexcept for a good sound system due to space considerationsi left the movie projector and screen at home i could have been much worse off these cars were clean just a day ago the dust was everywhere i saw lots of folks using bandannas to keep the dust from diluting the pot they were smoking music festival or refugee camp packed in like a can of sardines if you were on the inside of a row you were going to be staying for the entire festival whether you wanted to or not one of the many vendors sellingummmstuff quoting from the bonnaroo guide illegal drugs are forbidden at the festival and the festival safetysecurity staff will work with law enforcement officers to handle drug related violations in accordance with tennessee law native americans selling overpriced beads to the white man can you get more ironic an object lesson in failure to achieve victory yeah ask them what happens when you fail to control immigration centeroo field green camping bonnaroo style nothing green survives bonnaroo well except for the almighty dollar if everybody is having such a good timewhy arent they smiling im having so much fun im just going to lie here in the middle of the hot dusty road ribbon fries obviously bonnaroo wasnt all bad these ribbon fries were every bit as good as they looked and i got to meet alexa ray joel and talk with her for a few minutes for a young lady who has grown up in a spotlight with two famous parents she is refreshingly candid and just plain nice to be around she sings pretty well too railroad earth and if you could fight your way through all the obstacles there was some mighty fine music to be hadincluding these guysrailroad earth a newgrass jam band tuesday june 19 2007 tales from bonnaroo pt 5 day 4 sunday i bailed when i got back from the flaming lips saturday nightsunday morning one of my neighbors let me know that she and her husband had chased some folks out of my campsite they had been using my grill to cook up something that wasnt food i was pretty sure after that that i was done and when the kids across the street started playing an extended disco dance mix of pink floyds have a cigar at 530am i was completely sure i was on the road by 730am which actually worked out kind of nice since there was absolutely no traffic as i drove back towards kodak i thought about why i decided to leave early there were a lot of reasons but they boiled down to two big ones first and most importantly i wasnt in the right place to begin with everywhere i looked i didnt see people enjoying themselves i saw miserable people trying to substitute frantic activity for true pleasure i looked through the pictures id been taking and i realized that almost noone was smiling i was surrounded by people who felt that the epitome of a good time was to drink or dope themselves to the point of insensibility then stumble around in a near coma until they fell unconscious in the middle of a street or field wherever they happened to be and if they werent fogging their brains into oblivion they were busy spouting the most insane political propaganda imaginable i had a guy tell me that bonnaroo was a racist event because they didnt invite black groups to play which was ironic because we were listening to ziggy marley at the time it wasnt just the people it was the music when i was kid music was about optimism its goal was to make you feel good thats no longer the case today a lot of music is about anger and frustration and bonnaroo reflects that sitting in my campsite all i could here in some cases were the drumbeats and the bass linesand you could literally feel the menace and the anger they conveyed and the mood was contagious theres enough anger in the world without amplifying it the second factor was the organization of the festival itself or rather the lack of organization it seemed like the purpose of the sponsors was to interfere with any chance of people actually enjoying themselves it was strange to read in the guide that bonnaroo was against drug use yet see vendors lining the streets selling pipes bongs and other accessories while the police looked on blandly the hypocrisy rankled particularly when they were so concerned over whether my camera was professional or not in short the good music and enjoyable portions of the festival were far outweighed by the aggravations that went with it i got up sunday morning and decided id rather spend fathers day at home with my family so i left as i look back im glad i went and there were parts of it i really enjoyed but i will never do it again i will find other music festivals to attend though because i still like the idea of enjoying a weekend of really good music with a lot of other people maybe i can find a festival with meatloaf styx sister hazel and simon and garfunkel ill buy tickets for that show tomorrow tales from bonnaroo pt 4 day 3 saturday day three started out hot dry and brightjust like the days before it after the long delay at the gate the night before i decided to avoid the main gate for the remainder of the weekend i had to walk a little bit further to get to the side gate but there was almost no line and the security checks were much less strenuous i was actually allowed to bring my camera on site for the first time all weekend i went directly to the other tent where railroad earth was playing and met up with my brother and his friends we compared notes about the festival and who wed seen and heard they were planning to stay there for the hot tuna show and i wanted to sample some other groupsso i moved down the road towards the sonic stage where i got to talk with alexa ray joel again and get her autograph id missed most of railroad earths set at the other tent so i was happy to see that they would be playing at the sonic stage in just a few minutes so i stayed thereand happened upon another happy accident jonah smitha singer songwriter id never heard of before was playing a set and i really enjoyed his music his voice reminds me a bit of ken block of sister hazel but that may just be me in any case i really enjoyed his set and ive downloaded his album by the way just about every artist ive mentioned has songs available on zune marketplace after jonah i listened to the full railroad earth show and then wandered the venue checking out other acts and doing some people watching the crowds were the heaviest id seen at the festival and i decided since the police were playing that night id leave the crowds behind for a while and go out to my camp and get a little peace and quiet before the madness of 80000 people trying to get to the same place at the same time yeah i missed a couple of groups i wanted to hear this way but i was fuly charged up and ready for the police followed by the flaming lips unfortunately as my live blog of the police set covered they didnt play for the full two and a half hours they were scheduled for coming up about 45 minutes short i guess the greatest rock band of the 80s didnt think they had enough good music to fill the full set to be honest sting just doesnt seem to remember how to rock any more he didnt really cut loose until the final song and songs that should have rocked just kinda floated instead the flaming lips on the other hand put on one of the greatest shows ive ever seen even though i was a couple of hundred yards away from the stage i could still see what was going on their light rig was built to move and to look like a flying saucer although you couldnt see that at first the show started with the stage filling with red light and fog while spacey organs played a droning chord as the fog built the lights came down from above the stage showing the flying saucer and on top of the saucer was the lips front man wayne coyne trapped in a large transparent bubble the saucer moves down to the stage where coyne walks the bubble down the ramp and is released after a titanic struggle the saucer then tilts up to reveal a monster light show underneath and the show began in earnest im not going to describe the rest of it because you really should see it yourself but even though it wasnt my favorite music it was the best show of the festival day 3 tips saturday the venue is packed be prepared for large crowds and nowhere to sit hot tired and cranky rooers will be sitting everywhere they can find the least bit of shade eating on site can be challenging since there are as i just mentioned not many places to sit a few dozen picnic benches would go a long way towards improving conditions in centeroo flexibility is the watchword for the day the large crowds make it certain you will miss something you wanted to see to avoid waiting in long lines to get into the venue here are two helpful hints first avoid the main entrance like the plague second and this will seem counterintuitive dont go early get to the gate with just enough time to make your show the reason is simple everybody else will be doing the same thing and a huge crowd will develop health and safety concerns will force security to speed up the inspection process resulting in a line that moves about as fast as you can walk be prepared for the weather to change temperatures saturday night dipped into the high 50s or low 60s which is very chilly unless you have a decent sleeping bag or a decent sleeping partner when going to a show at one of the main stages you have two options you can get there several hours early and fight your way through the crowds to get somewhat close to the stage then stand up for 5 hours straight or you can get there 1015 minutes before the show set up a beach chair and sit back under the stars and listen to the band play live the night and evening shows are much more pleasant than the day shows they are also more popular plan accordingly upgrading entries ive come to the realization that microsoft word does not play well with the internet so im going back through my bonnaroo entries and correcting all the ugly punctuationand also correcting some og the glaring errors these were first draft style posts so im going to take a little time to lean them up sunday june 17 2007 tales from bonnaroo pt 3 day 2 friday i normally sleep in a very dark bedroom while my tent does a good job keeping out the rain bugs and apparently any humans of the female persuasion it doesnt block light very well so i was up early with the sun now as all good physicists know light is heat so the inside of my tent began to get warm very warm fortunately i was able to use my negotiating skills with sol and he agreed that if i opened up some vents and rolled over he wouldnt broil me inside my tent for at least two more hours so i went back to sleep until about 9 now one of the things about camping every year is that you gradually acquire all kinds of camping goodies in my case those goodies include a freestanding hot water shower so after i crawled out of my tent i proceeded to take a nice navy style shower which was kind of weird because here i was nekkid and there were dozens of people walking by on their way to the venue not that im shy or anything but im not used to carrying on a conversation with folks while im showering anyway the shower went fine until i realized that id left my towel in the cab of the truck i could have just left the tent nekkid and grabbed my towel but remember yesterday when i said you should make friends with your camping neighbors i dont think they were prepared to let our friendship get quite that close fortunately tony the guy camping right next to me was nice enough to retrieve my towel although the ladies across the way were yelling for me to flaunt my inadequacies before the world i told them maybe tomorrow i got very lucky with my neighbors through sheer luck of the draw 6 of the ten spots around me were filled with people close to my age and we all talked while we set up our campsites we quickly formed a little community which was great especially on saturday when some of my neighbors had to run off a few folks making themselves at home in my camp its kind of a funny place this place while i was making my breakfast eggs bacon and lemonade a guy came up and tried to place an order he thought i was a vendor or something i guess maybe i should hang out a sign and make some money while im here anyway once id finished my morning constitutionals i looked over the schedule and made sure i knew what my choices for todays music would be then i packed up the laptop and headed for the venue yeah i brought my laptop so what bonnaroo was providing wifi hotspots and i planned on using them unfortunately the bandwidth was severely limited and i could barely get on the internet to do anything useful thats why youre reading this late when i got to the venue gate like i mentioned in yesterdays report i learned that the rules had changed and security wasnt letting any cameras through whatsoever fortunately id left mine back in the truck however apparently bonnaroo hired their security from the same place that the airports hire theirs because there were cameras and camcorders everywhere im wondering what they wont allow tomorrow after last nights less than appealing experience i went looking for some music i knew would satisfy and i found it the first show i watched was uncle earl a 4 woman newgrass band that rocked it helped that they were pretty too im guessing that this show provided the first of the surprises that bonnaroo is famous for john paul jones former bassist for led zeppelin came out and played a few numbers with the band on the bass and the mandolin its this kind of flexibility that marks a true musician next up was alexa ray joel billys daughter it seems shes inherited her fathers talent and her mothers looks a great fortune in both cases while her skills arent as polished as her fathers she has a strong bluesy quality and is a pretty good song writer once she gets a few more miles under her beltshe might be something special the last number she did makes no difference to me title rocked the joint i got to talk to her a little after her set the following dayand shes a very sweet down to earth personits early enough in her career that shes still genuinely flattered when people respond to her next on the list was kings of leon the first act on the main stage good solid hard rock but i got there only 10 minutes before the show so i was way on back in the pasture i could barely see the stage but the two gigantic jumbotrons made up for that lack during the show we actually got a spot of rain that made things a little cooler for about 45 seconds then just turned to steam after about 45 minutes i ventured on to check out some other acts from the nightwatchman i heard the following speech were a new territory here and now were taking it back from george bush we are now the peoples republic of bonnaroo considering the fate of most peoples republics bloody purges and disastrous famines i hope hes wrong michael frenti made the following musical statement god is too big for just one religion tell it to the muslims pal theyre the ones running around beheading folks for their religion that does bring up an important point bonnaroo isnt just musical its political as well or maybe its political and they have some music on the side over and over ive heard the message that bonnaroo is a green festival and the sponsors have gone to great lengths to preach environmentalism global stewardship and the like look folks organizing a music festival to promote environmental responsibility is about as dumb as sponsoring an orgy to promote zero population growth as i look around the grounds i see a eighty thousand people trampling every living thing into the dust theres litter everywhere despite the best efforts of the cleanup crew and the easy availability of trash receptacles and lets face it theres no such thing as a green rv well okay the color green maybe but you know what i mean but the point im trying to make is that if you want to hear some good music and theres plenty of it here be prepared to get a heaping side helping of sanctimonious envirobabble along with a nice desert of liberal guilt making up for this are many wonderful new things to learn and try just as an example i saw a radically new way to prevent sunburn first take off all of your clothes if youre shy you can leave your pants on next allow a complete stranger to cover your entire body in paint and glitter finally do this in front of a hundred cheering clapping horny old farts who are taking your picture to post on the internet as soon as they get home on monday no you will not see any of those pictures here theres a weird sort of thing going on here ive never seen so many people be so proud to display their body but at the same time be unhappy with it tattoos piercings scarifications brandings breast and other implants and no youll see no pictures of those either so many of the people here are desperate to go to any length to feel better about their bodies okay enough social commentary back to the music i saw jennifer nicely a girl from my neck of the woods perform she was thrown off a bit by the noise of another band playing in the background but she pushed herself through it and did a credible job she has a jazzy delivery that reminds me of norah jones only not as accomplished next on my way to hear nashville band bang bang bang i got a chance to listen to the roots remember yesterday when i said you should listen to music you normally wouldnt well this was a case of that and im glad it did because i enjoyed the show a lot theyre listed as a hip hop group but their performance went far beyond any hip hop that ive heard admittedly not much if i had to describe them and since im writing this i do id have to say they remind me a little of blood sweat and tears and earth wind and fire all mashed together plucked out of the seventies and body slammed into the new century it sounds strange but it works id go see them again and thats saying something next up bang bang bang loud loud loud the feature act today was tool if youre into anger rage and depressingly monotonous bass lines not to mention satanic lyrics and imagery this is the group for you i went back to my campsite and ate dinner the midnight acts included the string cheese incident a bluegrass jazz fusion group that played from midnight until 3am i went out to catch the show only to get caught in a 45 minute line while security performed a very thorough check on everybody im not saying that they went too far but usually i have to pay 100 plus tips to be touched like that i felt like i owed the guy dinner or something day 2 tips bring a beach chair or something else to sit on a three hour show feels a lot longer when youre sitting on the hard ground arrive extra early to the venue of your choice the main stage is surrounded by a huge field and if you dont get there fairly early for the popular acts you might be better off just watching mtv from the comfort of your couch at home the other stages and tents are a little easier but getting there 15 minutes early makes a huge difference in where you sit do not expect the rules to remain consistent just because you were allowed in one day with a camera dont assume you will be allowed in the next day or the next hour allow extra time to get into the gates sometimes you wont need it but most times you will if youre running your campsite off of an inverter wired to your car battery start your car every couple of hours or so and let it run for 10 minutes the number one tool for day 2 is patience tales from bonnaroo pt 2 day one thursday when i first decided to go to bonnaroo i had a major misconception i anticipated a camping crowd similar to the ones i was used to at bristol had i thought about it ahead of time i would have known better obviously a festival crowd is a lot different than a race crowd i just didnt appreciate how different ive never seen so many dreadlocks and so much tie dye in one place its rainbows and snakes as far as the eye can see not to mention the bikinis everywhere some delightful others frightful due to the heat minimal attire is the rule of the day and most of the female crowd is following the rule in fact theres a burlesque show here thats probably going to close down because even after the stripper finishes stripping shes wearing more than most of the audience one piece of apparel noticeably lacking is the bra in fact ive seen more guys wearing a bra than girls i wish i were kidding the personality of the bonnaroo camper is a little bit different as well ive been camping at bristol for several years now and today was the first day id ever been offered a double lap dance for a stick of butter unfortunately along with such generosity in spirit comes some less desirable traits as well once i got my campsite set up i got many admiring remarks particularly on the shower and the kitchen but i also got some warnings to hide anything portable like my grill and stove otherwise they might get stolen now im sure that there are difficulties with thievery at bristol races as well but ive never worried about leaving my grill out before ah well we must adapt to the modern times so i lock up my grill when i leave camp getting from your campsite to the venue can be tricky particularly on the first day since gates may be open or locked at seemingly random intervals like yesterday when i asked why i got i dont know so you walk around following the crowd which is also wandering around semi aimlessly because they dont know either then one of them stumbles across an open gate and like lemmings over the cliff everybody converges on that spot as you work your way through the crowd you come to the security checkpoint where you will be checked for contraband the interesting thing about the search isnt the full contact pat down its the fact that the definition of contraband changes from day to day from gate to gate and from security guy to security guy apparently some security guys take their jobs very seriously because i saw two young ladies walking around without bikini tops i guess the guards thought they could be used to strangle somebody while it may be annoying to be told that the camera you brought in yesterday is no longer allowed today it does result in hours of entertainment for everybody else trapped in line behind you think of yourself as being part of the show and you know you always wanted to be in show business right when you get through the gate tip your security guy if you enjoyed the service then head through the vendors into the main area dont expect your usual carnival vendors here the items for sale are usually handmade and run the gamut from wooden puzzle boxes to hand tied hammocks to a place that lets you build your own drum the food also offers more choices than your average carnival or fair including cuban food greek several varieties of asian and for the true vol fan gator tail if youre cheap like me youll bring most of your food to eat in camp but leave a meal or two open for experimentation besides its such a long walk back to camp that youll probably want to eat at the venue to save a little wear and tear on the feet thursdays shows started off around 330 or so and there werent a lot of acts i wanted to see except for some knoxville groups like smokin dave and the primo dopes and the westside daredevils the dopes show was pretty good until politics took over but what else would you expect from todd steed i stayed with him right up until he tried to put himself in the place of a soldier apparently without ever actually speaking to a real soldier considering my son is about to ship off to iraq in the next few months i lost patience with smokin dave and skipped the rest of his show im sure he didnt mind from the dave debacle i wandered around and sampled music from all of the tents operating before winding up listening to another knoxville group the tenderhooks they had a lot of trouble getting the mix right which made it hard to hear the lead singers vocals but the female base player sang some lovely harmonies it sounds like they have promise and theyre playing another set later in the weekend so i may try to catch them again and that brings me to a major dilemma that will face every bonnaroo goer trying to decide which groups to see when there are 8 playing at the same time and dont even dare to hope that your two favorites wont be scheduled to play at the same time they will be my first night ended early about midnight at that point id been awake for 38 hours and i was ready to sleep i had to miss the westside daredevils but they too will be playing later in the festival so ill catch them then tips from day 1 plan ahead use your schedule to pick the acts you really want to see fill in the gaps with shopping eating or hearing an act youve never heard of challenge yourself be careful what you bring in to the venue just because they let you bring it in yesterday doesnt mean theyll let you in today if you get turned away from one gate try another take your time this is a marathon not a sprint youve got three more days of this ahead of you try food youve never had before yeah its a little pricey but its nowhere near as bad as disneyland if youre turned away from the gate for carrying something you shouldnt try another gate get to know the folks camping near you youre neighbors for the next 96 hours you might as well be friendly drink plenty of water before you leave your campsite and keep drinking it while youre at the venue bonnaroo provides free water stations or you can spend 250 for a bottle by the way to answer your question the young ladies got their butter i did not however accept their generous offer tales from bonnaroo pt 1 ok ive switched venues and while im waiting for the flaming lips im going to take advantage of the free wifi to upload some of the things ive written over the last few days getting there is none of the fun the emotions experienced in getting to bonnaroo compare favorably with many other notable life transitions like your first root canal your first full physical exam after you turn 40 and the first time a woman rips your heart out and stomps it flat on the floor its not getting to the festival thats so tough its what happens after you get there that causes strokes high blood pressure and screaming fits of rage first of all the organizers of this event decided that in order to improve traffic flow they would have two entrances one on either side of the campground this sounds wonderful except that on the opening morning they only used one entrance i asked a traffic control person why they were sending us all the way to the other side of the campground and got an answer i was to hear over and over again throughout the weekend i dont know thats just what they told me to do now its bad enough that they only have one entrance open but for some reason they decided to fill the campsites from back to front so by virtue of being early to bonnaroo im camping just about as far from the venue as possible delightful but the fun doesnt stop there no sir as you first enter the campground they break the line of traffic up into about 15 lanes for inspection you see bonnaroo has a lot of very strict rules about what they allow on site and what they dont those rules are spelled out in multiple places on their website and include limits on how much alcohol each person may bring in with them obviously in order to enforce these rules they have to inspect every vehicle that comes in the gate heres where the insanity begins how are you going to inspect a fully loaded and packed up truck car or rv without causing a traffic snarl of epic proportions answer you cant so the folks at bonnaroo have come up with a unique solution they divide a single lane of traffic into about 15 and route them to 15 inspection stations after you pass through the inspection they recombine these 15 lanes of traffic back into one of course there are no lane markings so what happens is a free for all that makes a demolition derby look like a sunday drive in the park heres the capper after creating this monstrous traffic snarl the inspection consisted of a single question do you have any glass containers or weapons in your truck does an 8 pound sledge and a crowbar count nope then no i dont okay off you go no im not kidding after passing through this rigorous inspection process and after weaving my way back into single file i drove the length of the campground out to the back 40 where three teenage kids guided me to my spot in paradise a 10 square foot plot of overgrown weeds and space to park my truck i actually caught a break on this one im at the end of a row so if i have an emergency and have to leave i can get out the folks in the interior are not so lucky they cant leave until the people around them leave which should make monday a very interesting day planning and arrival tips come early come late it doesnt seem to matter much as far as the wait goes there are very specific rules on what you can and cant bring with you and the type of shelters you can use they are available well in advance of the event ignore them you will have a very limited amount of space to set up your campsite roughly 100 square feet plus your vehicle plan accordingly prices are high as you might expect make sure to bring everything you need bring extra ice plan on drinking roughly a gallon of fluids a day this does not include alcohol bring your own toilet paper showers are 10 a solar shower from walmart is 6 you do the math you will want to take a shower your neighbors will want you to take a shower the three most vital things to bring besides lots of water are a hat sunglasses sunblock traffic getting into the site is a nightmare so make sure you have plenty of gas to get in and back out again cell phone service is available but spotty encourage your family to send text messages instead they get through easier saturday june 16 2007 live blogging bonnaroo im not sure how long this connection will last but while it does expect to read my thoughts on

            "text": "Day 4 Sunday\n\n \n\n I bailed.\n\n \n\n When I got back from the Flaming Lips Saturday night/Sunday morning, one of my neighbors let me know that she and her husband had chased some folks out of my campsite. They had been using my grill to cook up something that wasn't food. I was pretty sure after that that I was done, and when the kids across the street started playing an extended disco dance mix of Pink Floyd's Have a Cigar at 5:30AM I was completely sure. I was on the road by 7:30AM, which actually worked out kind of nice since there was absolutely no traffic. As I drove back towards Kodak, I thought about why I decided to leave early. There were a lot of reasons, but they boiled down to two big ones.\n\n \n\n First, and most importantly, I wasn't in the right place to begin with. Everywhere I looked, I didn't see people enjoying themselves; I saw miserable people trying to substitute frantic activity for true pleasure. I looked through the pictures I'd been taking and I realized that almost no-one was smiling. I was surrounded by people who felt that the epitome of a good time was to drink or dope themselves to the point of insensibility then stumble around in a near coma until they fell unconscious in the middle of a street or field, wherever they happened to be. And if they weren't fogging their brains into oblivion, they were busy spouting the most insane political propaganda imaginable. I had a guy tell me that Bonnaroo was a racist event because they didn't invite black groups to play, which was ironic because we were listening to Ziggy Marley at the time.\n\n \n\n It wasn't just the people; it was the music. When I was kid, music was about optimism; it's goal was to make you feel good. That's no longer the case. Today, a lot of music is about anger and frustration, and Bonnaroo reflects that. Sitting in my campsite, all I could here in some cases were the drumbeats and the bass lines,and you could literally feel the menace and the anger they conveyed. And the mood was contagious.\n\n \n\n There's enough anger in the world without amplifying it.\n\n \n\n The second factor was the organization of the festival itself, or rather, the lack of organization. It seemed like the purpose of the sponsors was to interfere with any chance of people actually enjoying themselves. It was strange to read in the guide that Bonnaroo was against drug use, yet see vendors lining the streets selling pipes, bongs, and other accessories while the police looked on blandly. The hypocrisy rankled, particularly when they were so concerned over whether my camera was \"professional\" or not.\n\n \n\n In short, the good music and enjoyable portions of the festival were far outweighed by the aggravations that went with it. I got up Sunday morning and decided I'd rather spend Father's Day at home with my family.\n\n \n\n So I left.\n\n \n\n As I look back, I'm glad I went, and there were parts of it I really enjoyed, but I will never do it again. I will find other music festivals to attend, though, because I still like the idea of enjoying a weekend of really good music with a lot of other people; maybe I can find a festival with Meatloaf, Styx, Sister Hazel, and Simon and Garfunkel.\n\n \n\n I'll buy tickets for that show tomorrow. \n\n \n\n\n\nDay 3 Saturday\n\n \n\n Day three started out hot, dry, and bright,just like the days before it. After the long delay at the gate the night before, I decided to avoid the main gate for the remainder of the weekend. I had to walk a little bit further to get to the side gate, but there was almost no line, and the security checks were much less strenuous. I was actually allowed to bring my camera on site for the first time all weekend. I went directly to The Other Tent, where Railroad Earth was playing and met up with my brother and his friends. We compared notes about the festival, and who we'd seen and heard. They were planning to stay there for the Hot Tuna, show, and I wanted to sample some other groups,so I moved down the road towards the Sonic stage, where I got to talk with Alexa Ray Joel again and get her autograph. I'd missed most of Railroad Earth's set at The Other Tent, so I was happy to see that they would be playing at the Sonic Stage in just a few minutes, so I stayed there,and happened upon another happy accident.\n\n \n\n Jonah Smith,a singer songwriter I'd never heard of before was playing a set and I really enjoyed his music. His voice reminds me a bit of Ken Block of Sister Hazel, but that may just be me. In any case, I really enjoyed his set, and I've downloaded his album.\n\n \n\n By the way, just about every artist I've mentioned has songs available on Zune Marketplace.\n\n \n\n After Jonah, I listened to the full Railroad Earth show, and then wandered the venue checking out other acts, and doing some people watching. The crowds were the heaviest I'd seen at the festival and I decided since the Police were playing that night, I'd leave the crowds behind for a while and go out to my camp and get a little peace and quiet before the madness of 80,000 people trying to get to the same place at the same time. Yeah, I missed a couple of groups I wanted to hear this way, but I was fuly charged up and ready for the Police, followed by the Flaming Lips.\n\n \n\n Unfortunately, as my live blog of the Police set covered, they didn't play for the full two and a half hours they were scheduled for, coming up about 45 minutes short. I guess the greatest rock band of the 80's didn't think they had enough good music to fill the full set. To be honest, Sting just doesn't seem to remember how to rock any more. He didn't really cut loose until the final song, and songs that should have rocked just kinda floated instead.\n\n \n\n The Flaming Lips, on the other hand, put on one of the greatest shows I've ever seen. Even though I was a couple of hundred yards away from the stage, I could still see what was going on.\n\n \n\n Their light rig was built to move, and to look like a flying saucer, although you couldn't see that at first. The show started with the stage filling with red light and fog, while spacey organs played a droning chord. As the fog built, the lights came down from above the stage, showing the flying saucer, and on top of the saucer was the Lips' front man, Wayne Coyne, trapped in a large transparent bubble. The saucer moves down to the stage, where Coyne walks the bubble down the ramp and is released after a titanic struggle. The saucer then tilts up to reveal a monster light show underneath, and the show began in earnest.\n\n \n\n I'm not going to describe the rest of it because you really should see it yourself, but even though it wasn't my favorite music, it was the best show of the festival.\n\n \n\n Day 3 Tips\n\n \n\n Saturday, the venue is packed. Be prepared for large crowds and nowhere to sit. Hot, tired, and cranky Rooers will be sitting everywhere they can find the least bit of shade.\n\n Eating on site can be challenging since there are, as I just mentioned, not many places to sit. A few dozen picnic benches would go a long way towards improving conditions in Centeroo.\n\n Flexibility is the watchword for the day. The large crowds make it certain you will miss something you wanted to see.\n\n To avoid waiting in long lines to get into the venue, here are two helpful hints.\n\n First, avoid the main entrance like the plague.\n\n Second, and this will seem counterintuitive, don't go early. Get to the gate with just enough time to make your show. The reason is simple; everybody else will be doing the same thing and a huge crowd will develop. Health and safety concerns will force security to speed up the inspection process, resulting in a line that moves about as fast as you can walk. \n\n Be prepared for the weather to change. Temperatures Saturday night dipped into the high 50's or low 60's which is very chilly unless you have a decent sleeping bag. Or a decent sleeping partner.\n\n When going to a show at one of the main stages, you have two options.\n\n You can get there several hours early and fight your way through the crowds to get somewhat close to the stage, then stand up for 5 hours straight. Or you can get there 10-15 minutes before the show, set up a beach chair and sit back under the stars and listen to the band play live. \n\n The night and evening shows are much more pleasant than the day shows. They are also more popular. Plan accordingly. \n\n \n\n Day three started out hot, dry, and bright,just like the days before it. After the long delay at the gate the night before, I decided to avoid the main gate for the remainder of the weekend. I had to walk a little bit further to get to the side gate, but there was almost no line, and the security checks were much less strenuous.

The saucer then tilts up to reveal a monster light show underneath, and the show began in earnest.I'm not going to describe the rest of it because you really should see it yourself, but even though it wasn't my favorite music, it was the best show of the festival.\n\nI've come to the realization that Microsoft word does not play well with the internet, so I'm going back through my Bonnaroo entries and correcting all the ugly punctuation,and also correcting some og the glaring errors. These were first draft style posts, so I'm going to take a little time to lean them up. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n I normally sleep in a very dark bedroom. While my tent does a good job keeping out the rain, bugs, and apparently any humans of the female persuasion, it doesn't block light very well, so I was up early with the sun. Now as all good physicists know, light is heat, so the inside of my tent began to get warm. Very warm. Fortunately I was able to use my negotiating skills with Sol, and he agreed that if I opened up some vents and rolled over, he wouldn't broil me inside my tent for at least two more hours, so I went back to sleep until about 9.\n\n \n\n Now one of the things about camping every year is that you gradually acquire all kinds of camping goodies; In my case, those goodies include a freestanding hot water shower. So after I crawled out of my tent, I proceeded to take a nice Navy style shower, which was kind of weird because here I was nekkid, and there were dozens of people walking by on their way to the venue. Not that I'm shy or anything but I'm not used to carrying on a conversation with folks while I'm showering.. Anyway, the shower went fine until I realized that I'd left my towel in the cab of the truck. I could have just left the tent nekkid and grabbed my towel, but remember yesterday, when I said you should make friends with your camping neighbors?\n\n \n\n I don't think they were prepared to let our friendship get quite that close.\n\n \n\n Fortunately, Tony, the guy camping right next to me, was nice enough to retrieve my towel, although the ladies across the way were yelling for me to flaunt my inadequacies before the world.\n\n \n\n I told them maybe tomorrow.\n\n \n\n I got very lucky with my neighbors. Through sheer luck of the draw, 6 of the ten spots around me were filled with people close to my age, and we all talked while we set up our campsites. We quickly formed a little community, which was great, especially on Saturday, when some of my neighbors had to run off a few folks making themselves at home in my camp.\n\n \n\n It's kind of a funny place, this place. While I was making my breakfast (Eggs, bacon, and lemonade) a guy came up and tried to place an order. He thought I was a vendor or something I guess. Maybe I should hang out a sign and make some money while I'm here.\n\n \n\n Anyway, once I'd finished my morning constitutionals, I looked over the schedule and made sure I knew what my choices for today's music would be, then I packed up the laptop and headed for the venue. Yeah, I brought my laptop; so what? Bonnaroo was providing WiFi hotspots, and I planned on using them. Unfortunately, the bandwidth was severely limited, and I could barely get on the internet to do anything useful. That's why you're reading this late.\n\n When I got to the venue gate, like I mentioned in yesterday's report, I learned that the rules had changed, and security wasn't letting any cameras through whatsoever. Fortunately, I'd left mine back in the truck. However, apparently Bonnaroo hired their security from the same place that the airports hire theirs because there were cameras and camcorders everywhere. I'm wondering what they won't allow tomorrow.\n\n \n\n After last night's less than appealing experience, I went looking for some music I knew would satisfy, and I found it. The first show I watched was Uncle Earl, a 4 woman newgrass band that rocked. It helped that they were pretty, too. I'm guessing that this show provided the first of the surprises that Bonnaroo is famous for. John Paul Jones, former bassist for Led Zeppelin, came out and played a few numbers with the band on the bass and the mandolin. It's this kind of flexibility that marks a true musician. \n\n \n\n Next up was Alexa Ray Joel, Billy's daughter. It seems she's inherited her father's talent and her mother's looks, a great fortune in both cases. While her skills aren't as polished as her father's, she has a strong bluesy quality and is a pretty good song writer. Once she gets a few more miles under her belt,she might be something special. The last number she did, \"Makes No Difference to Me\" (title?) rocked the joint. I got to talk to her a little after her set the following day,and she's a very sweet down to earth person.It's early enough in her career that she's still genuinely flattered when people respond to her.\n\n \n\n Next on the list was Kings of Leon, the first act on the main stage. Good solid hard rock, but I got there only 10 minutes before the show, so I was way on back in the pasture. I could barely see the stage, but the two gigantic jumbotrons made up for that lack. During the show we actually got a spot of rain that made things a little cooler for about 45 seconds, then just turned to steam. After about 45 minutes, I ventured on to check out some other acts.\n\n \n\n From the Nightwatchman, I heard the following speech:\n\n \n\n \"We're a new territory here and now. We're taking it back from George Bush. We are now the People's Republic of Bonnaroo.\"\n\n \n\n Considering the fate of most People's Republics: bloody purges and disastrous famines, I hope he's wrong.\n\n \n\n Michael Frenti made the following musical statement:\n\n \n\n \"God is too big for just one religion!\"\n\n \n\n Tell it to the Muslims, pal. They're the ones running around beheading folks for their religion.\n\n \n\n That does bring up an important point. Bonnaroo isn't just musical; It's political as well. Or maybe it's political, and they have some music on the side. Over and over I've heard the message that Bonnaroo is a green festival, and the sponsors have gone to great lengths to preach environmentalism, global stewardship, and the like. \n\n \n\n Look folks, organizing a music festival to promote environmental responsibility is about as dumb as sponsoring an orgy to promote zero population growth. As I look around the grounds I see a eighty thousand people trampling every living thing into the dust. There's litter everywhere, despite the best efforts of the cleanup crew, and the easy availability of trash receptacles. And let's face it, there's no such thing as a green RV.\n\n \n\n Well okay, the color green maybe, but you know what I mean.\n\n \n\n But the point I'm trying to make is that if you want to hear some good music, and there's plenty of it here, be prepared to get a heaping side helping of sanctimonious enviro-babble along with a nice desert of liberal guilt.\n\n \n\n Making up for this are many wonderful new things to learn and try. Just as an example, I saw a radically new way to prevent sunburn. First, take off all of your clothes. If you're shy, you can leave your pants on. Next, allow a complete stranger to cover your entire body in paint and glitter. Finally, do this in front of a hundred cheering, clapping, horny old farts who are taking your picture to post on the internet as soon as they get home on Monday.\n\n \n\n No, you will not see any of those pictures here.\n\n \n\n There's a weird sort of thing going on here; I've never seen so many people be so proud to display their body, but at the same time be unhappy with it. Tattoos, piercings, scarifications, brandings, breast and other implants (and no, you'll see no pictures of those either); so many of the people here are desperate to go to any length to feel better about their bodies.\n\n \n\n Okay, enough social commentary. Back to the music.\n\n \n\n I saw Jennifer Nicely, a girl from my neck of the woods perform. She was thrown off a bit by the noise of another band playing in the background, but she pushed herself through it and did a credible job. She has a jazzy delivery that reminds me of Norah Jones, only not as accomplished. \n\n \n\n Next, on my way to hear Nashville band Bang Bang Bang, I got a chance to listen to The Roots. Remember yesterday when I said you should listen to music you normally wouldn't? Well, this was a case of that, and I'm glad it did because I enjoyed the show a lot. They're listed as a hip hop group, but their performance went far beyond any hip hop that I've heard, admittedly not much. If I had to describe them, and since I'm writing this I do, I'd have to say they remind me a little of Blood Sweat and Tears and Earth Wind and Fire all mashed together, plucked out of the seventies and body slammed into the new century.\n\n It sounds strange, but it works. I'd go see them again, and that's saying something.\n\n \n\n Next up, Bang Bang Bang.\n\n Loud Loud Loud.\n\n \n\n The feature act today was Tool. If you're into anger, rage, and depressingly monotonous bass lines, not to mention Satanic lyrics and imagery, this is the group for you. I went back to my campsite and ate dinner.\n\n \n\n The midnight acts included The String Cheese Incident, a bluegrass jazz fusion group that played from midnight until 3AM. I went out to catch the show, only to get caught in a 45 minute line while security performed a very thorough check on everybody. I'm not saying that they went too far, but usually, I have to pay $100 plus tips to be touched like that. I felt like I owed the guy dinner or something.\n\n \n\n Day 2 Tips\n\n \n\n Bring a beach chair or something else to sit on. A three hour show feels a lot longer when you're sitting on the hard ground\n\n Arrive extra early to the venue of your choice. The main stage is surrounded by a huge field, and if you don't get there fairly early for the popular acts, you might be better off just watching MTV from the comfort of your couch at home. The other stages and tents are a little easier, but getting there 15 minutes early makes a huge difference in where you sit.\n\n Do not expect the rules to remain consistent. Just because you were allowed in one day with a camera, don't assume you will be allowed in the next day. Or the next hour.\n\n Allow extra time to get into the gates. Sometimes you won't need it, but most times, you will.\n\n If you're running your campsite off of an inverter wired to your car battery, start your car every couple of hours or so and let it run for 10 minutes.\n\n The number one tool for Day 2 is patience. \n\n \n\n Day 2: FridayI normally sleep in a very dark bedroom. While my tent does a good job keeping out the rain, bugs, and apparently any humans of the female persuasion, it doesn't block light very well, so I was up early with the sun. Now as all good physicists know, light is heat, so the inside of my tent began to get warm. Very warm. Fortunately I was able to use my negotiating skills with Sol, and he agreed that if I opened up some vents and rolled over, he wouldn't broil me inside my tent for at least two more hours, so I went back to sleep until about 9.Now one of the things about camping every year is that you gradually acquire all kinds of camping goodies; In my case, those goodies include a freestanding hot water shower. So after I crawled out of my tent, I proceeded to take a nice Navy style shower, which was kind of weird because here I was nekkid, and there were dozens of people walking by on their way to the venue. Not that I'm shy or anything but I'm not used to carrying on a conversation with folks while I'm showering.. Anyway, the shower went fine until I realized that I'd left my towel in the cab of the truck. I could have just left the tent nekkid and grabbed my towel, but remember yesterday, when I said you should make friends with your camping neighbors?I don't think they were prepared to let our friendship get quite that close.Fortunately, Tony, the guy camping right next to me, was nice enough to retrieve my towel, although the ladies across the way were yelling for me to flaunt my inadequacies before the world.I told them maybe tomorrow.I got very lucky with my neighbors. Through sheer luck of the draw, 6 of the ten spots around me were filled with people close to my age, and we all talked while we set up our campsites. We quickly formed a little community, which was great, especially on Saturday, when some of my neighbors had to run off a few folks making themselves at home in my camp.It's kind of a funny place, this place. While I was making my breakfast (Eggs, bacon, and lemonade) a guy came up and tried to place an order. He thought I was a vendor or something I guess. Maybe I should hang out a sign and make some money while I'm here.Anyway, once I'd finished my morning constitutionals, I looked over the schedule and made sure I knew what my choices for today's music would be, then I packed up the laptop and headed for the venue. Yeah, I brought my laptop; so what? Bonnaroo was providing WiFi hotspots, and I planned on using them. Unfortunately, the bandwidth was severely limited, and I could barely get on the internet to do anything useful. That's why you're reading this late.When I got to the venue gate, like I mentioned in yesterday's report, I learned that the rules had changed, and security wasn't letting any cameras through whatsoever. Fortunately, I'd left mine back in the truck. However, apparently Bonnaroo hired their security from the same place that the airports hire theirs because there were cameras and camcorders everywhere. I'm wondering what they won't allow tomorrow.After last night's less than appealing experience, I went looking for some music I knew would satisfy, and I found it. The first show I watched was Uncle Earl, a 4 woman newgrass band that rocked. It helped that they were pretty, too. I'm guessing that this show provided the first of the surprises that Bonnaroo is famous for. John Paul Jones, former bassist for Led Zeppelin, came out and played a few numbers with the band on the bass and the mandolin. It's this kind of flexibility that marks a true musician.Next up was Alexa Ray Joel, Billy's daughter. It seems she's inherited her father's talent and her mother's looks, a great fortune in both cases. While her skills aren't as polished as her father's, she has a strong bluesy quality and is a pretty good song writer. Once she gets a few more miles under her belt,she might be something special. The last number she did, \"Makes No Difference to Me\" (title?) rocked the joint. I got to talk to her a little after her set the following day,and she's a very sweet down to earth person.It's early enough in her career that she's still genuinely flattered when people respond to her.Next on the list was Kings of Leon, the first act on the main stage. Good solid hard rock, but I got there only 10 minutes before the show, so I was way on back in the pasture. I could barely see the stage, but the two gigantic jumbotrons made up for that lack. During the show we actually got a spot of rain that made things a little cooler for about 45 seconds, then just turned to steam. After about 45 minutes, I ventured on to check out some other acts.From the Nightwatchman, I heard the following speech:\"We're a new territory here and now. We're taking it back from George Bush. We are now the People's Republic of Bonnaroo.\"Considering the fate of most People's Republics: bloody purges and disastrous famines, I hope he's wrong.Michael Frenti made the following musical statement:\"God is too big for just one religion!\"Tell it to the Muslims, pal. They're the ones running around beheading folks for their religion.That does bring up an important point. Bonnaroo isn't just musical; It's political as well. Or maybe it's political, and they have some music on the side. Over and over I've heard the message that Bonnaroo is a green festival, and the sponsors have gone to great lengths to preach environmentalism, global stewardship, and the like.Look folks, organizing a music festival to promote environmental responsibility is about as dumb as sponsoring an orgy to promote zero population growth. As I look around the grounds I see a eighty thousand people trampling every living thing into the dust. There's litter everywhere, despite the best efforts of the cleanup crew, and the easy availability of trash receptacles. And let's face it, there's no such thing as a green RV.Well okay, the color green maybe, but you know what I mean.But the point I'm trying to make is that if you want to hear some good music, and there's plenty of it here, be prepared to get a heaping side helping of sanctimonious enviro-babble along with a nice desert of liberal guilt.Making up for this are many wonderful new things to learn and try. Just as an example, I saw a radically new way to prevent sunburn. First, take off all of your clothes. If you're shy, you can leave your pants on. Next, allow a complete stranger to cover your entire body in paint and glitter. Finally, do this in front of a hundred cheering, clapping, horny old farts who are taking your picture to post on the internet as soon as they get home on Monday.No, you will not see any of those pictures here.There's a weird sort of thing going on here; I've never seen so many people be so proud to display their body, but at the same time be unhappy with it. Tattoos, piercings, scarifications, brandings, breast and other implants (and no, you'll see no pictures of those either); so many of the people here are desperate to go to any length to feel better about their bodies.Okay, enough social commentary. Back to the music.I saw Jennifer Nicely, a girl from my neck of the woods perform. She was thrown off a bit by the noise of another band playing in the background, but she pushed herself through it and did a credible job. She has a jazzy delivery that reminds me of Norah Jones, only not as accomplished.Next, on my way to hear Nashville band Bang Bang Bang, I got a chance to listen to The Roots.

I'd go see them again, and that's saying something.Next up, Bang Bang Bang.Loud Loud Loud.The feature act today was Tool. If you're into anger, rage, and depressingly monotonous bass lines, not to mention Satanic lyrics and imagery, this is the group for you.

I'm not saying that they went too far, but usually, I have to pay $100 plus tips to be touched like that. I felt like I owed the guy dinner or something.\n\nDay One Thursday\n\n \n\n When I first decided to go to Bonnaroo, I had a major misconception. I anticipated a camping crowd similar to the ones I was used to at Bristol. Had I thought about it ahead of time, I would have known better. Obviously a festival crowd is a lot different than a race crowd. I just didn't appreciate how different. I've never seen so many dreadlocks and so much tie dye in one place. It's rainbows and snakes as far as the eye can see.\n\n \n\n Not to mention the bikinis everywhere, some delightful, others frightful. Due to the heat, minimal attire is the rule of the day, and most of the female crowd is following the rule. In fact, there's a burlesque show here that's probably going to close down because even after the stripper finishes stripping, she's wearing more than most of the audience.\n\n \n\n One piece of apparel noticeably lacking is the bra. In fact, I've seen more guys wearing a bra than girls. \n\n \n\n I wish I were kidding.\n\n \n\n The personality of the Bonnaroo camper is a little bit different as well. I've been camping at Bristol for several years now and today was the first day I'd ever been offered a double lap dance for a stick of butter. Unfortunately, along with such generosity in spirit, comes some less desirable traits as well. Once I got my campsite set up, I got many admiring remarks, particularly on the shower and the kitchen, but I also got some warnings to hide anything portable, like my grill and stove, otherwise they might get stolen. Now I'm sure that there are difficulties with thievery at Bristol races as well, but I've never worried about leaving my grill out before.\n\n \n\n Ah well, we must adapt to the modern times, so I lock up my grill when I leave camp.\n\n Getting from your campsite to the venue can be tricky, particularly on the first day, since gates may be open or locked at seemingly random intervals. Like yesterday, when I asked why, I got:\n\n \"I don't know.\"\n\n \n\n So you walk around following the crowd, which is also wandering around semi aimlessly, because they don't know either, then one of them stumbles across an open gate, and like lemmings over the cliff, everybody converges on that spot. As you work your way through the crowd, you come to the security checkpoint, where you will be checked for contraband. The interesting thing about the search isn't the full contact pat down, it's the fact that the definition of \"contraband\" changes from day to day, from gate to gate, and from security guy to security guy. Apparently some security guys take their jobs very seriously because I saw two young ladies walking around without bikini tops. I guess the guards thought they could be used to strangle somebody.\n\n \n\n While it may be annoying to be told that the camera you brought in yesterday is no longer allowed today, it does result in hours of entertainment for everybody else trapped in line behind you. Think of yourself as being part of the show, and you know you always wanted to be in show business, right?\n\n \n\n When you get through the gate tip your security guy if you enjoyed the service, then head through the vendors into the main area. Don't expect your usual carnival vendors here. The items for sale are usually handmade, and run the gamut from wooden puzzle boxes to hand tied hammocks to a place that lets you build your own drum. The food also offers more choices than your average carnival or fair, including Cuban food, Greek, several varieties of Asian, and for the true Vol fan, gator tail. If you're cheap like me, you'll bring most of your food to eat in camp, but leave a meal or two open for experimentation. Besides, it's such a long walk back to camp that you'll probably want to eat at the venue to save a little wear and tear on the feet.\n\n \n\n Thursday's shows started off around 3:30 or so, and there weren't a lot of acts I wanted to see, except for some Knoxville groups like Smokin Dave and the Primo Dopes, and the Westside Daredevils. The Dopes show was pretty good until politics took over, but what else would you expect from Todd Steed? I stayed with him right up until he tried to put himself in the place of a soldier, apparently without ever actually speaking to a real soldier. Considering my son is about to ship off to Iraq in the next few months, I lost patience with Smokin’ Dave and skipped the rest of his show. I'm sure he didn't mind.\n\n \n\n From the Dave debacle, I wandered around and sampled music from all of the tents operating before winding up listening to another Knoxville group, the Tenderhooks. They had a lot of trouble getting the mix right, which made it hard to hear the lead singer's vocals, but the female base player sang some lovely harmonies. It sounds like they have promise, and they're playing another set later in the weekend so I may try to catch them again.\n\n \n\n And that brings me to a major dilemma that will face every Bonnaroo goer: trying to decide which groups to see when there are 8 playing at the same time. And don’t even dare to hope that your two favorites won't be scheduled to play at the same time. They will be.\n\n \n\n My first night ended early, about midnight. At that point I'd been awake for 38 hours and I was ready to sleep. I had to miss the Westside Daredevils, but they too will be playing later in the festival, so I'll catch them then.\n\n Tips from Day 1\n\n Plan ahead. Use your schedule to pick the acts you really want to see. Fill in the gaps with shopping, eating, or hearing an act youve never heard of. Challenge yourself.\n\n Be careful what you bring in to the venue. Just because they let you bring it in yesterday doesn’t mean they'll let you in today.\n\n If you get turned away from one gate, try another.\n\n Take your time. This is a marathon, not a sprint. You’ve got three more days of this ahead of you.\n\n Try food you've never had before. Yeah, it's a little pricey, but it's nowhere near as bad as Disneyland.\n\n If you’re turned away from the gate for carrying something you shouldn't, try another gate.\n\n Get to know the folks camping near you. You're neighbors for the next 96 hours; you might as well be friendly.\n\n Drink plenty of water before you leave your campsite, and keep drinking it while you're at the venue. Bonnaroo provides free water stations, or you can spend $2.50 for a bottle. \n\n By the way, to answer your question, the young ladies got their butter. I did not however accept their generous offer. \n\n \n\n When I first decided to go to Bonnaroo, I had a major misconception.

I did not however accept their generous offer.\n\n\n\n \n\n Getting There is None of the Fun\n\n \n\n The emotions experienced in getting to Bonnaroo compare favorably with many other notable life transitions, like your first root canal, your first \"full\" physical exam after you turn 40, and the first time a woman rips your heart out and stomps it flat on the floor. It's not getting to the festival that's so tough; it's what happens after you get there that causes strokes, high blood pressure, and screaming fits of rage.\n\n First of all, the organizers of this event decided that in order to improve traffic flow, they would have two entrances, one on either side of the campground. This sounds wonderful, except that on the opening morning, they only used one entrance!\n\n I asked a traffic control person why they were sending us all the way to the other side of the campground, and got an answer I was to hear over and over again throughout the weekend;\n\n 'I don’t know, that's just what they told me to do.\"\n\n Now, it's bad enough that they only have one entrance open, but for some reason, they decided to fill the campsites from back to front. So, by virtue of being early to Bonnaroo, I'm camping just about as far from the venue as possible.\n\n Delightful.\n\n But the fun doesn’t stop there, no sir. As you first enter the campground, they break the line of traffic up into about 15 lanes for inspection. You see, Bonnaroo has a lot of very strict rules about what they allow on site and what they don't. Those rules are spelled out in multiple places on their website, and include limits on how much alcohol each person may bring in with them. Obviously, in order to enforce these rules, they have to inspect every vehicle that comes in the gate.\n\n Here’s where the insanity begins. How are you going to inspect a fully loaded and packed up truck, car or RV without causing a traffic snarl of epic proportions? Answer: You can't. So the folks at Bonnaroo have come up with a unique solution. They divide a single lane of traffic into about 15 and route them to 15 inspection stations. After you pass through the inspection, they recombine these 15 lanes of traffic back into one. Of course, there are no lane markings, so what happens is a free for all that makes a demolition derby look like a Sunday drive in the park. Here’s the capper. After creating this monstrous traffic snarl, the inspection consisted of a single question.\n\n \"Do you have any glass containers or weapons in your truck?\"\n\n \"Does an 8 pound sledge and a crowbar count?\"\n\n \"Nope.\"\n\n \"Then no, I don’t.\"\n\n \"Okay, off you go.\"\n\n No, I’m not kidding.\n\n After passing through this rigorous inspection process, and after weaving my way back into single file, I drove the length of the campground out to the back 40 where three teenage kids guided me to my spot in paradise, a 10 square foot plot of overgrown weeds and space to park my truck. I actually caught a break on this one. I'm at the end of a row, so if I have an emergency and have to leave, I can get out. The folks in the interior are not so lucky. They can't leave until the people around them leave which should make Monday a very interesting day.\n\n Planning and Arrival Tips\n\n Come early, come late, it doesn’t seem to matter much as far as the wait goes.\n\n There are very specific rules on what you can and can’t bring with you and the type of shelters you can use. They are available well in advance of the event. Ignore them.\n\n You will have a very limited amount of space to set up your campsite, roughly 100 square feet plus your vehicle. Plan accordingly.\n\n Prices are high as you might expect. Make sure to bring everything you need.\n\n Plan on drinking roughly a gallon of fluids a day. This does not include alcohol\n\n Showers are $10. A solar shower from WalMart is $6. You do the math.\n\n You will want to take a shower.\n\n Your neighbors will want you to take a shower.\n\n The three most vital things to bring besides lots of water are \n\n \n\n Traffic getting into the site is a nightmare so make sure you have plenty of gas to get in, and back out again.\n\n Cell phone service is available, but spotty. Encourage your family to send text messages instead. They get through easier. \n\n \n\n Ok, I've switched venues, and while I'm waiting for The Flaming Lips, I'm going to take advantage of the free Wi-Fi to upload some of the things I've written over the last few days.The emotions experienced in getting to Bonnaroo compare favorably with many other notable life transitions, like your first root canal, your first \"full\" physical exam after you turn 40, and the first time a woman rips your heart out and stomps it flat on the floor.

As I sit in the middle of this field typing, I have about 4.5 hours of battery life. I expect I'll need it.\n\n \n\n 8:51 I just had a web designer ask if I was really online or not.\n\n \n\n I am.\n\n \n\n 8:52 A girl just asked if she could check her myspace.\n\n \n\n 8:54 I can't touch type. This should be interesting.\n\n \n\n 8:55 I'm proud to accept the nomination as world's biggest geek for live blogging a rock concert.\n\n \n\n 9:00 Open with Message in a Bottle. The crowd of 80,000+ rises to it's feet. Ok, some stagger to their knees but the thought was there.\n\n \n\n 9:04 I'm probably 150-200 yards from the stage and at this distance, Sting looks like a horse's butt. Wait, I'm sorry, that's the actual butt of the guy standing in front of me.\n\n \n\n 9:05 Many Miles Away??? The mix is a little bass heavy.\n\n \n\n 9:09 The Elvis Twins, jumpsuits and all, just walked behind me.\n\n \n\n 9:11 Walkin' on the Moon. I;m not entirely certain, but I think somebody nearby is smoking something that isn't tobacco based. Don't tell anybody, OK?\n\n \n\n 9:15 This s the perfect antidote to Tool, who played last night. They were all about anger, rage, and aggression. I skipped the show but could still hear it from my tent, so the cleaner happier sound of the Police is a welcome contrast.\n\n \n\n 9:16 Some song I don't know. Driven to Tears??? Enough people have sat down so I can see one of the video screens now. \n\n \n\n 9:21 Voices. I heard about Stewart Copeland calling Sting a \"prancing little man\" on stage. I haven't seen that, but it does seem that Sting has been so sensitive for so long, he's forgotten how to rock.\n\n \n\n 9:22 I may be getting some of these song titles wrong. That's okay. I think the band is getting some of the notes wrong as well. Just kidding guys. (Like they are going to read this.)\n\n \n\n 9;30 Another song I don't know. Sting is singing \"Woo-ooohhh-oooh\" if that helps. Truth is everybody?\n\n \n\n 9:35 Every Little Thing She Does, with a little calypso feel to it. Sing along....Eeeooohoh\n\n \n\n 9:37 I'm not sure if Sting is aware of where he is. He hasn't said the word \"Bonnaroo\" yet. Then again, it is a silly word.\n\n \n\n 9:38 Wrapped Around your Finger. Sting is definitely more comfortable on the slower,more sensitive numbers.\n\n \n\n 9:47 ASIDK. Just had a nice conversation with the girl sitting behind me who wanted to know what the heck I was doing. She was very nice and refrained from telling me how strange I was.\n\n \n\n 9:50 De Doo Doo Doo, De Dah Dah Dah Sting skipped the high notes but he's going to be singing for another couple of hours, so that's understandable. I skip the high notes when I'm singing in the shower.\n\n \n\n 9:55 Walking in your Footsteps. Nice bongos. Oops, sorry, that's the girl standing in front of me.\n\n \n\n 10:00 ASIDK I Can't Stand Losing You?? Sting says \"Bonnaroo\" for the first time. Also the first number that begins to rock.\n\n \n\n 10:01 Roxanne And the crowd goes wild.\n\n \n\n 10:17 Every Little Thing She Does is Magic\n\n \n\n 10:22 ASIDK\n\n \n\n 10:27 The last few entries were sparse. I was trying to use the internet to help a young lady named Hannah find her group. She needed a phone number so she tried a reverse lookup. Ain't the internet cool?\n\n \n\n 10:30 Every Breath you Take. Sting pretended to end the show an hour early. Uncool.\n\n \n\n 10:36 ASIDK but it rocks. For the first time tonight, I suspect Sting still possesses his testicles.\n\n \n\n 10:42 And the show is over, 45 minutes early. I want my money back. Hey, do you think Meatloaf will ever play Bonnaroo?\n\n \n\n Thus ends the Police live blogging experience. I hope you enjoyed it/",

            "body": "shots across the bow thursday june 26 2008 the heller decision the supreme court today decided on a 54 basis that the second amendment confirms an individual right to keep and bear arms what this means is that 4 out of 9 supreme court justices either can not read simple english sentences or that 4 out of 9 justices would rather follow their own prejudices than the constitution the fact that these 4 justices are the most liberal is not a coincidence wednesday june 25 2008 kanye west is a poser yep you heard me right hes nothing but a loudmouth who acts like he has a social agenda but in reality its all about him how do i know this remember a few years back during the benefit for new orleans after katrina kanye went off script to deliver an impassioned plea to the people of america theyre killing us he said shortly before his famous george bush doesnt like black people he was in a state of moral outrage as he railed against the injustices of the federal response to katrina but as angry offended and outraged as he was then he says nothing can compare or ever will compare with how offended he was at being booed by a bonnarroo crowd angered because his show started almost 2 hours late on his website west wrote this is the most offended ive ever been this is the maddest i ever will be so let me get this straight kanye is more offended by being booed than by police shooting at looters in new orleans what a guy tuesday june 24 2008 more stupidity yesterday i pointed out stacy campfields ridiculous post about refusing to issue birth certificates for us citizens based on the actions of their parents today in the spirit of bipartisan snark i am obliged to point out the ridiculous response coming from my old friend r neal at knoxviews here is randys headline if link doesnt work go to httpwwwknoxviewscomnode8240 randy is funny sometimes about allowing links from my site to his slavery was a better immigration system now ive read stacys post in detail and theres absolutely nothing in stacys post that can even be remotely construed as approval of slavery only a warped and twisted reading of the post in question could result in such an interpretation randy isnt stupid and im relatively certain hes neither warped or twisted so what gives is he that worked up about campfield or was he just providing a little red meat for the monkeys in his echo chamber hey i never thought id be in the position of defending campfield but if youre going to ridicule a guy for the stupid things he says and campfield has said some fairly stupid things you shouldnt need to make stuff up to do it monday june 23 2008 when is it ok to refuse to give a birth certificate to a us citizen according to stacy campfield if you dont like their parents the state does not have to issue a birth certificate mrcampfield posts about his amendment that would prevent the state from issuing a birth certificate to a child born in the us to two illegal alien parents his logic goes like this 1 if both parents are here illegally then they are not under our jurisdiction and therefore their baby is not automatically a citizen 2 citizenship is a federal matter and birth certificates are issued by the state even if the child is a us citizen the state has no obligation to issue a birth certificate wow ok lets apply a little bit of real world logic here not the stuff that passes for it in the mirror maze of mr campfields mind if a man is in this country illegally he is subject to arrest and deportation he is given a hearing to determine his status and that all applicable laws regarding his case are met he has legal avenues to pursue to apply for asylum if he is incarcerated during the process he has civil rights that must be observed if he commits a crime while in the us he can be charged tried convicted and sentenced regardless of his immigration status now im not a lawyer but the above seems to suggest that our illegal alien is certainly under local state and federal jurisdiction so much for point number one as for point number two if mr campfield had finished reading the 14th amendment he would have gotten to the part about no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws thats pretty simple to read and it says that if a person is a citizen then the state can not pass any law that would abridge their rights and privileges and withholding a birth certificate would certainly do that very thing i understand that we need to get control of immigration but we need to do it intelligently not with stupid amendments that will never stand up to a constitutional challenge i dont care for the anchor baby loophole either but i dont see any way to close it without causing worse problems down the road thursday june 05 2008 humility you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means obamas speech we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last best hope on earth and i face this challenge with profound humility all he needs to add to his act is water into wine and walking on water to achieve deity status the dems will probably even let him skip that whole messy crucifixion thing wednesday june 04 2008 the first fight of the presidential campaign the sun had barely set on the democratic primary race and already sen obama and mccain were battling the issue who gets hillary as their vp mccain needs her to cement his image as a spineless rino bridge building maverick and obama needs her as a life insurance policy the two presidential candidates lost no time in beginning to suck up to sen clinton who lapped up the attention like scarlett ohara at the twelve oaks barbecue sen mccain speaking in new orleans yesterday said senator clinton has earned great respect for her tenacity and courage the media often overlooked how compassionately she spoke to the concerns and dreams of millions of americans and she deserves a lot more appreciation than she sometimes received as the father of three daughters i owe her a debt for inspiring millions of women to believe there is no opportunity in this great country beyond their reach i am proud to call her my friend obama was quick to plant his own smooches at the belle of the balls feet i want to publicly acknowledge hillary clinton for the outstanding race that she has run he said she is a true friend of israel she is a great senator from new york she is an extraordinary leader of the democratic party and she has made history alongside me over the last 16 months so i am very proud to have competed against her as for sen clinton she just batted her eyelashes let out a fiddle dee dee followed by a genteel giggle and asked for another plate of barbecue on a more serious note i dont understand why folks are assuming mccain will choose a running mate who will bolster his conservative credentials after all conventional wisdom says that in a presidential election you run to your base during the primary then to the center for the general election mccain ran so far to the middle during the primary season the only people out there further to the left are democrats like lieberman obama and you guessed it hillary clinton tuesday june 03 2008 what is up with wbir i was watching the 1100 news and couldnt believe what i was seeing on a night when barack obama claimed victory in the race for the nomination they teased that story and went into their top story of the night a utpd bicycle officer doing a face plant that was caught on you tube this is the lead story oksure a local news station usually leads with a local story but the next story to air was about the retrial ordered for gussie vann currently on death row for raping and murdering his 8 year old daughter note the link goes to the knoxville news sentinel a search of the wbir website for gussie vann came back empty a kiddie cop acting the fool is a bigger story than obama claiming the nomination and a murdering rapist getting a new trial seriously ah but where else could you get to see college students pontificating about how people shouldnt goof off at work especially when they are getting paid by my daddys tax dollars truly a sad night for local news but dont worry the national boys have some issues as well check out this screen grab from my yahoo news page yes the headline is all about obama but the picture and the story are all about hillary sour grapes anyone speaking of sour grapes not that im flogging a dead horse or anything but im not convinced that hillary plans on retiring quietly to the howard dean home for failed presidential ambitions just yet i am curious about how all the hillary supporters will react if she does concede to put it politely some of them have really been hard on obama will they eat their words swallow their dislike and vote for him anywayor will they walk away in disgust monday june 02 2008 hillarys big win no not puerto rico her win came from the loving hands of the dnc who agreed to seat all of the delegates from michigan and florida but only giving them a half of a vote each this was a complete victory for clinton who has now assured that obama can not win the delegates needed to clinch the nomination out right heres how it works with all of the delegates seated obama is back to needing 2200 delegates to clinch ie a majority of the delegates seated but because the michigan and florida delegates only get half a vote there wont be enough to put him over the top without the michigan and florida delegates he was within striking distance of the 2000 he needed but now once the implications of seating the delegates sinks in hell be further away from a majority it really is a masterstroke of strategery in a move that seems to favor obama the dnc actually just guaranteed more chaos at the convention chaos that will end with a clinton victory or do you think hillary wont take advantage of a mathematical loophole to win the nomination page 1 of 1 pages",

of tuesday longtime iraq prime minister nouri almaliki was on his way out as the longterm outcome for his divided country seemed troubled at best iraq has not followed the script that the architects and supporters of the us invasion and occupation created since the bush ii era and now the volatile nation has again become a hot spot for american military action heres a rundown of some recent developments in iraq the us sent fighter jets and drones as part of a new campaign in iraq against the islamic state in iraq and syria isis and in the early hours sunday began a series of airstrikes that destroyed vehicles and artillery belonging to the radical islamist group according to the guardian the objective was to free tens of thousands of iraqi yazidis who are being held hostage on a northern mountain near the town of sinjar last week 40000 iraqis were stranded on the mountain unable to leave due to the death threats from isis and lacking sufficient supplies to survive isis was formed by an extreme sect of sunni jihadists who have targeted iraqi and kurdish minorities since the usled invasion of iraq in 2003 they consider yazidis to be devil worshippers and as one of the villagers interviewed by the guardian put it yazidis are being told to convert or lose our heads according to mohammed shia alsudani iraqs human rights minister isis militants have killed at least 500 members of iraqs yazidi minority some of these victims were buried alive alsudani said including women and children and about 300 women were captured as slaves this interactive map from the new york times traces isis movements in iraq and syria since 2013 isis forces have seized five oil fields and three cities along an 800mile section of iraq near syria isis territorial gains have given the sunni extremists control over much of central iraq meanwhile iraqs weak military has been unable to push back effectively and kurdish officials have also claimed they are outgunned by isis isis has been able to grow its numbers by connecting with iraqs sunni population who have felt marginalized by the shiite government dr hisham alhashimi an iraqi expert on isis told the guardian that there are now 30000 to 50000 members and that 30 percent of those are ideologues while the rest were coerced or joined out of fear in the same article another expert weighed in with his read on the worsening situation iraq is spiralling out of control said ali khedery the former longestserving us official in baghdad the centrifugal forces are spinning so quickly they are on one timeline and washington is on another i am beyond concerned khedery who reported to five us ambassadors and three us central command generals and is now chairman of the dubaibased consultancy dragoman partners said everybody is retreating to their corners and there is no credible international actor that i can see that is trying to bring it together again it definitely is an existential threat to the iraqi government and i

            "text": "As of Tuesday, longtime Iraq Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was on his way out, as the long-term outcome for his divided country seemed troubled at best.\n\nIraq has not followed the script that the architects and supporters of the U.S. invasion and occupation created since the Bush II era, and now the volatile nation has again become a hot spot for American military action.\n\nHere’s a rundown of some recent developments in Iraq:\n\nThe U.S. sent fighter jets and drones as part of a new campaign in Iraq against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and in the early hours Sunday, began a series of airstrikes that destroyed vehicles and artillery belonging to the radical Islamist group. According to The Guardian, the objective was to free tens of thousands of Iraqi Yazidis who are being held hostage on a northern mountain near the town of Sinjar.\n\nLast week, 40,000 Iraqis were stranded on the mountain, unable to leave due to the death threats from ISIS and lacking sufficient supplies to survive.\n\nISIS was formed by an extreme sect of Sunni jihadists who have targeted Iraqi and Kurdish minorities since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. They consider Yazidis to be devil worshippers, and as one of the villagers interviewed by The Guardian put it, Yazidis “are being told to convert or lose our heads.”\n\nAccording to Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, Iraq’s human rights minister, ISIS militants have killed at least 500 members of Iraq’s Yazidi minority. Some of these victims were buried alive, al-Sudani said, including women and children, and about 300 women were captured as slaves.\n\nThis interactive map from The New York Times traces ISIS’ movements in Iraq and Syria since 2013.\n\nISIS forces have seized five oil fields and three cities along an 800-mile section of Iraq near Syria. ISIS’ territorial gains have given the Sunni extremists control over much of central Iraq. Meanwhile, Iraq’s weak military has been unable to push back effectively, and Kurdish officials have also claimed they are outgunned by ISIS.\n\nISIS has been able to grow its numbers by connecting with Iraq’s Sunni population who have felt marginalized by the Shiite government. Dr. Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi expert on ISIS, told The Guardian that there are now 30,000 to 50,000 members and that 30 percent of those are “ideologues,” while the rest were coerced or joined out of fear. In the same article, another expert weighed in with his read on the worsening situation:\n\n“Iraq is spiralling out of control,” said Ali Khedery, the former longest-serving US official in Baghdad. “The centrifugal forces are spinning so quickly. They are on one timeline and Washington is on another. I am beyond concerned.” Khedery, who reported to five US ambassadors and three US central command generals and is now chairman of the Dubai-based consultancy Dragoman Partners, said: “Everybody is retreating to their corners. And there is no credible international actor that I can see that is trying to bring it together again. “It definitely is an existential threat to the Iraqi government and I think it represents yet another manifestation of the disintegration of Iraq as we know it. “Iranian overreach, the genocide in Syria, [Nouri] al-Maliki’s consolidation of power in a very sectarian way, have all led to the disillusionment, the disenfranchisement of the Sunni Arabs, who have fatally, but perhaps understandably, chosen to consummate a deal with the devil. Now we are locked in a race to the bottom.”\n\nOn Sunday, Kurdish forces, with airborne support from the U.S., were able to take back the towns of Guwair and Makhmur in northern Iraq. As of Sunday, at least 20,000 of the Iraqis stranded on the mountain were able to escape after U.S. airstrikes.\n\nBut the effectiveness of these airstrikes in diminishing ISIS’ stronghold on Iraq seems to be minimal, according to recent statements by the Pentagon.\n\nSome 30,000 people escaped to Syria, where they were then escorted to Iraqi Kurdistan by Kurdish forces. The U.S. is slated to provide light weaponry to the Kurds through the CIA.\n\nBut arming the Kurds could lead to more problems due to the fact that some Kurdish factions hope to split off in northern Iraq. These potential separations in different parts of the country could result in additional disagreements over contested areas, multiethnic cities and oil holdings. The Peshmerga had already taken over disputed areas as of last June, and the Kurds now control the city of Kirkuk, located about 150 miles north of Baghdad.\n\n \n\n As of Tuesday, al-Maliki appeared to be out of a job, and Haider al-Abadi, who currently has widespread support from the U.S., Iran, Saudi Arabia and NATO, seemed likely to take his place. Al-Maliki’s departure, and the possible measures required to remove him, might spark Shiite infighting—yet another cause for division in an already unstable political landscape.\n\nMore Below the Ad",

Suddenly, sentence fragments from Friday prayers can be heard on the banks of the Euphrates River. \"Gather together ... smash the traitors of the faith!\" The words from the preacher, distorted by the amplifiers so loved by the jihadists, sound almost spooky.Down along the river, the jihadists with the Islamic State (IS) gather together for the next attack. A few hundred meters above on the sparse, sun-drenched hills, the Kurds are sitting, feeling like they've somehow ended up on the set of a horror film.\n\n\"Haider al-Abadi was not nominated by the Dawa party, and he only represents himself,\" said Khodair al-Hozaei, who served as vice-president, under former President, Jalal Talabani.\n\nThe official Facebook page for Maliki's State of Law coalition said Abadi's nomination had \"no value,\" and a senior leader in the Dawa party, to which both Abadi and Maliki belong, said Abadi's nomination did not represent the group.\n\nMaliki remains caretaker prime minister until Abadi can form a new government, which he has 30 days to do.\n\n\"The country is now in your hands,\" Massoum told Abadi, who moments earlier was selected as nominee for prime minister instead of incumbent Nouri al-Maliki by the Shia National Alliance parliamentary bloc.\n\nFouad Massoum tasked Abadi, first deputy speaker of parliament, with the role during a brief ceremony broadcast live on television on Monday.\n\nBut officials rejected allegations on Monday that it was encouraging “regime change”, insisting instead that the US was merely supporting a constitutional process rather than favouring individual politicians in Baghdad.\n\nThe Obama administration had become increasingly strident in its criticism of Maliki in recent weeks, accusing him of the current Islamic uprising by failing to govern in the interest of all Iraqis.\n\n“Under the Iraqi constitution this is an important step toward forming a new government that can unite Iraq’s different communities,” said the US president in a statement from his vacation home on the island of Martha’s Vineyard.\n\nObama welcomed the selection of a new prime minister by Iraq’s president Faud Massoum on Monday, describing it as a “promising step forward” toward a more inclusive government.\n\nPlease feel free to share your articles and stories in the comments.\n\nWelcome to the Overnight News Digest with a crew consisting of founder Magnifico, current leader Neon Vincent, regular editors side pocket, maggiejean, wader, Man Oh Man, rfall, and JML9999.

The new fires in Lassen, Modoc and Shasta counties were not threatening any structures, but crews were trying to contain them so they can \"concentrate on the large ones that we still have,\" California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokeswoman Lynne Tolmachoff said. She was referring to a wildfire that was sparked by lightning on July 30 and has burned 13.5 square miles of dry brush and timber near Laytonville in Mendocino County. An evacuation order remains in effect as the fire about 160 miles north of San Francisco threatens nearly 60 structures across six communities, CalFire spokesman Brandon Rodgers said. Eleven firefighters have been injured, including eight on Friday. All suffered minor injuries or burns, officials said.\n\nA federal judge has extended a months-long moratorium on executions in Ohio into next year as questions mount about the effectiveness of a new, two-drug combination being used to carry out the death penalty. The debate over the death penalty has been intensified in America and lethal injection has been under increased scrutiny after executions went awry in Ohio, Oklahoma and Arizona. The Ohio ruling by federal judge Gregory Frost will delay executions scheduled for September, October and November and highlights the ongoing problem faced by states in obtaining drugs to put inmates to death. The last moratorium was scheduled to expire this week. The one-page order by Frost issued Friday extends it through 15 January. It affects Ohio’s latest death penalty policy change, which was announced in late April and increases the amount of the sedative and painkiller Ohio uses.\n\nThe collision was as common as any in racing. Kevin Ward Jr’s car spun twice like a top, wheels hugging the wall, before it plopped backward on the dimly lit dirt track. In a sport steeped with bravado, what happened next was another familiar, but treacherous, move: wearing a black firesuit and black helmet, the 20-year-old Ward unbuckled himself, climbed out of the winged car into the night and defiantly walked onto the track at Canandaigua Motorsports Park. He gestured, making his disgust evident with the driver who triggered the wreck with a bump: three-time Nascar champion Tony Stewart. Ward, a relative unknown compared to Nascar’s noted swashbuckler, was nearly hit by another passing car as he pointed with his right arm in Stewart’s direction. As he confronted Stewart in his passing car, disaster struck.\n\nNew York’s state attorney general on Monday settled allegations of racial profiling at Barneys, one of the city’s most famous department stores, in a controversy that had dragged in rap mogul Jay Z. Eric Schneiderman launched an investigation into the designer store nine months ago amid a wider probe into allegations of racism at other famous New York shopping sites including Macy’s. Barneys has now agreed to pay $525,000 in fees and penalties and to implement a series of changes to ensure it does not discriminate against black and Hispanic customers. “Profiling and racial discrimination remain a problem in our state, but not one we are willing to accept. This agreement will continue our work to ensure there’s one set of rules for everyone in public accommodations, including customers in New York’s retail establishments,” Schneiderman said. “This agreement will correct a number of wrongs, both by fixing past policies and by monitoring the actions of Barneys and its employees to make sure that past mistakes are not repeated.”\n\nHundreds of protesters gathered at a suburban St Louis police station on Monday demanding murder charges against an officer who shot to death an unarmed black teenager over the weekend. The largely peaceful protests, monitored by about 50 police officers in riot gear, took place after a night of rioting when demonstrations over the death of Michael Brown, 18, turned violent. About two dozen businesses were damaged in the rioting overnight, 32 people were arrested, and two officers were injured, police said. “Last night was the worst night of my life.” The FBI is looking into any civil rights violations in the case, a spokeswoman for the agency said. St. Louis County police is leading the investigation into the shooting itself.\n\nIn his victory speech in Ankara, the newly elected president claimed he would be a president for all Turks, including those who did not vote for him. Erdogan called for \"new social reconciliation\" and pleaded for a presidential system to be implemented by making changes to the constitution. The head of state, who currently in Turkey fulfils representative tasks, is expected to receive new powers in the future. Beginning immediately, the president and government will work hand-in-hand, Erdogan said in front of thousands of enthusiastic supporters.\n\n His statements have unsettled his opponents. Under the \"Erdogan system,\" they say, there would be nothing left to slow the powerful man at the top. Serious injustices should be feared, warned opposition columnist Hasan Cemal on the internet site T24.\n\nUkraine's National Security and Defense Council on Monday said the \"liberation\" was \"imminent\" in both cities, including the largest, Donetsk, where rockets hit a jail, enabling some 100 inmates to flee. Kyiv's security council spokesman, Andriy Lysenko, said \"for civilians it is wise to leave\" both cities through what he termed \"humanitarian corridors.\" According to Interfax Ukraine, Lysenko also said government forces would keep up momentum so insurgents could not receive new weapons. The two cities are the last separatist strongholds, originally seized by rebels after the ouster of former president Viktor Yanukovych in February. Officials in Luhansk, the second largest city held by pro-Russian rebels, said residents were \"on the edge of survival,\" with no power or water, and fuel, food and medicines running short.\n\nIsrael and the Palestinians have begun indirect talks in Cairo to try and end the conflict in Gaza and lift the blockade on the coastal enclave, Egypt's state news agency MENA has said. Egypt is acting as a go-between for the talks, which began on Monday a day after the two sides agreed to begin a new 72-hour truce. The Israeli delegation arrived in Cairo earlier in the day for the indirect negotiations with Palestinian factions. The Palestinian delegation was already in the Egyptian capital and locked in talks with Egyptian intelligence mediators, who will relay their demands to the Israeli negotiators, a Palestinian official told AFP news agency. The Israeli delegation landed in Cairo in the morning, just hours after a 72-hour ceasefire came into effect. Almost 12 hours into the truce, the skies over Gaza remained calm, with no reports of violations on any side and signs of life emerging from the war-torn coastal enclave which is home to 1.8 million Palestinians. Residents began returning to their damaged homes to see what belongings they could salvage and fishermen cast their nets out to sea.\n\nThe most recent cease-fire appears to be holding in the Gaza Strip, but vast damage has already been done. In addition to the appalling loss of life and destruction of property, the war has pushed even more Palestinians to the radical fringes. A piece of a bed frame dangles from a lemon tree. Next to it hangs the remains of rattan shelves, destroyed and catapulted into the small yard by the explosion of a bomb. The detonation decimated the home of Hassan Khalil Ibrash, knocking over the mandarin-colored walls and transforming his bedroom into a terrace -- one with a grotesque view. His eyes revealing his exhaustion, Ibrash stands in flip-flops among the charred remains. Next to him, 12 stairs climb skyward like an incomplete sculpture. He is surrounded by nothing but destruction, with dust rising from the gray ruins in the midday heat. Israeli bombs have almost completely razed Ibrash's neighborhood in Rafah, a town in the southernmost tip of the Gaza Strip.\n\nGarment workers in five Bangladeshi factories that supplied clothes for Walmart and other western retailers finally received their wages on Sunday, following an 11-day hunger strike. The settlement came after the managing director of the Tuba Group, Delwar Hossain, was bailed on 5 August. Hossain has been in prison since February on charges of homicide and negligence leading to the death of 112 workers in a factory fire at the Tazreen Fashions factory in Dhaka in November 2012. Workers stopped production on 10 June after the management failed to pay their wages in May, Shahidullah Azim, vice-president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association told the Guardian. About 1,600 workers in the five factories, nearly 1,300 of whom are female, had been on hunger strike since 28 July demanding their back pay. Mushrefa Mishu, president of Garment Workers’ Unity Forum, who headed the workers’ movement in the Tuba Group, said: “Withholding workers’ wages was dirty politics from the owners to have Delwar bailed out.”\n\nAfghans voted for a president in April 5. Then they cast ballots June 14 in a runoff between the top two candidates. Now all 8 million votes from that second round are being audited, a laborious process that includes daily arguments, occasional fistfights and and a yet another deadline that seems to be slipping away. While this is moving at a snail's pace, at least the process hasn't broken down completely. Secretary of State John Kerry visited last week and persuaded the two candidates, Abdullah Abdullah, the former foreign minister, and Ashraf Ghani, the former finance minister, to stick to the agreement for a full audit that they reached in July. Abdullah won the initial round in April, with 45 percent to 32 percent for Ghani. But Ghani was leading in the runoff when Abdullah's camp complained of widespread fraud.\n\nDUCOR, Calif. – The only sign of life sprouting out of a vast expanse of land in this unincorporated corner of Tulare County is a large drilling rig and two trucks laden with 1,000-foot-long drill pipes. Men in hard hats work round the clock in sweltering 100-plus degree temperatures and in the still of the night, under the glare of construction night lights. They’re boring down 40 feet an hour to reach their ultimate goal of 2,000 feet into the Tulare Basin aquifer. Once dug and built, the well could eventually pump up to 1,000 gallons of water a minute and turn the arid ground above into the fertile soil that California’s Central Valley is renowned for. Large agricultural company J Poonan Limited Partnership owns the land and has invested more than $500,000 to drill the well. That doesn’t count the cost of building reservoirs to store the water, testing and environmental studies that could bring the final costs well above $1 million. It’s an expensive quest. But when 80% of California is in an extreme drought, surface water runoff from the mountains stops flowing and reservoirs are depleted, farmers see the only way to go is down – way down. “It’s the busiest we’ve ever been,” said Eddie Robledo, of Rottman Drilling Co., who helps oversee the drilling here.\n\nWhen people lose their vision as they get older, they lose a lot of other things, too. They lose their ability to do the things they love. \"You can't read, you can't cook, and you can't socialize — and as a result, you may become demoralized, withdrawn and depressed,\" says Dr. Barry Rovner, a geriatric psychiatrist at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Rovner is not talking about typical eyesight deterioration as we age. He's talking about a specific condition called age-related macular degeneration, which, in severe cases, afflicts about 2 million older Americans. The macula is the central part of the retina that contains the densest concentration of light-sensing receptors, and it's crucial for making out fine details. Perhaps the scariest part of the loss is that people often can't recognize faces or \"read\" someone's facial expression.\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Intel on Monday officially took the wraps off its new processor -- the Core M, also known as Broadwell -- that will let PC makers build much thinner and lighter devices. Intel and other chip companies are racing to release ever more advanced processor technologies by shrinking the geometries of the chips. Intel is ahead of the pack with its processors built at 14 nanometers, or billionths of a meter. Moving to 14 nanometers from Intel's prior 22-nanometer chip, dubbed Haswell, allows PC makers to build devices that are thinner, lighter, more power efficient, and don't need a fan. Removing a fan is key for Intel as it pushes its chips in tablets and laptops that can convert into tablets. Chips based on ARM Holdings' rival technology already allow for fanless designs. The Core M hits the market several months later than Intel had planned because of problems manufacturing the advanced technology. Intel in October revealed production on Broadwell would be delayed to early 2014 rather than the fourth quarter of 2013 because of a \"defect density issue\" that impacted the yields, or number of usable chips. The company has now worked out all the kinks and is manufacturing Broadwell at high volumes.\n\nEDGARTOWN, Mass. — Faced with the politically devastating collapse of HealthCare.gov last year, President Obama’s White House staff lured Mikey Dickerson away from Google to save the day. Mr. Dickerson will lead a new government team that is intended to identify and fix the government’s other failing computer systems and websites, officials said Monday. The decision to hire Mr. Dickerson full time is a blunt acknowledgment that even Mr. Obama’s government — with a leadership that embraced technology to win two national elections — has yet to fully adopt a Silicon Valley mind-set when it comes to cutting-edge computer systems and consumer-friendly Internet portals.",

stronghold of sinjar have fled to dohuk in the kurdish north or to irbil where regional authorities have been struggling since june to deal with one of the biggest and most rapid refugee movements in decades sinjar itself has been all but emptied of its 300000 residents since jihadists stormed the city late on saturday but an estimated 25000 people remain we are being told to convert or to lose

low ammunition is low and so is water we have one piece of bread to share between 10 people we have to walk 2km to get water there were some air strikes yesterday against the jihadists but they have made no difference at least 500 yazidis including 40 children have been killed in the past week local officials say many more have received direct threats either from the advancing militants or members of nearby sunni communities allied with them they were our neighbours and now they are our killers said atyas its not like this is a oneoff incident said the unicef spokeswoman juliette touma

sometimes having to walk for days the impact on kids is very physical let alone the psychological impact the kurdish minority yazidis have long been regarded as devil worshippers by sunni jihadists

claimed on wednesday that its military had carried out an air strike on a mosul prison which killed scores of jihadists and freed an unknown number of prisoners the area was impossible to access and the numbers of fatalities could not be verified however witnesses reported damage to the prison and relatives rushed to the gates in the hope of rescuing detained family members kurdish peshmurga

the jihadists who were using heavy weapons looted from iraqi bases the same weapons are being used to consolidate isiss hold on much of western iraq the group has significantly boosted its numbers by

longestserving us official in baghdad the centrifugal forces are spinning so quickly they are on one timeline and washington is on another i am beyond concerned khedery who reported to five us

            "text": "Titus 2:13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\n\ntheguardian.com – Tens of thousands of members of one of Iraq’s oldest minorities have been stranded on a mountain in the country’s north-west, facing slaughter at the hands of jihadists surrounding them below if they flee, or death by dehydration if they stay.\n\nUN groups say at least 40,000 members of the Yazidi sect, many of them women and children, have taken refuge in nine locations on Mount Sinjar, a craggy, mile-high ridge identified in local legend as the final resting place of Noah’s ark.\n\nAt least 130,000 more people, many from the Yazidi stronghold of Sinjar, have fled to Dohuk, in the Kurdish north, or to Irbil, where regional authorities have been struggling since June to deal with one of the biggest and most rapid refugee movements in decades.\n\nSinjar itself has been all but emptied of its 300,000 residents since jihadists stormed the city late on Saturday, but an estimated 25,000 people remain. “We are being told to convert or to lose our heads,” said Khuldoon Atyas, who has stayed behind to guard his family’s crops. “There is no one coming to help.”\n\nAnother man, who is hiding in the mountains and identified himself as Nafi’ee, said: “Food is low, ammunition is low, and so is water. We have one piece of bread to share between 10 people. We have to walk 2km to get water. There were some air strikes yesterday [against the jihadists], but they have made no difference.”\n\nAt least 500 Yazidis, including 40 children, have been killed in the past week, local officials say. Many more have received direct threats, either from the advancing militants or members of nearby Sunni communities allied with them. “They were our neighbours and now they are our killers,” said Atyas.\n\n“It’s not like this is a one-off incident,” said the Unicef spokeswoman Juliette Touma. “We are almost back to square zero in terms of the preparedness and the supplies. Enormous numbers of people have been crossing the border since June.\n\n“The stresses are enormous; dehydration, fatigue, people sometimes having to walk for days. The impact on kids is very physical, let alone the psychological impact.”\n\nThe Kurdish minority Yazidis have long been regarded as devil worshippers by Sunni jihadists who have targeted them since the US invasion. As the extremists’ latest and most potent incarnation, the Islamic State (Isis), has steadily conquered Iraq’s north, the small, self-contained community has been especially vulnerable.\n\nIsis forces advanced across north-western Iraq almost unchecked since a small band of hardliners stormed Iraq’s second city, Mosul, on 10 June, sending the Iraqi army fleeing and shattering the central government’s control.\n\nFlush with weapons looted from Iraqi arsenals, Isis sacked Tikrit and advanced on Kirkuk. With new recruits lured or pressganged along the way, it has captured five oilfields and three cities, an 800-mile stretch of border with Syria. It has menaced Baghdad and is now within striking distance of Iraq’s two largest dams.\n\n“The situation is slowly tipping in their favour,” said Dr Hisham al-Hashimi, Iraq’s leading expert on Isis. “They won’t take the dam near Mosul, but Haditha [at the centre of Iraq's water and energy supply grid] will be very hard to defend.\n\n“They are very close to Baghdad airport. If they breached the perimeter, even with a symbolic attack, it would be enormous propaganda value for them.”\n\nIraq’s beleaguered military has been unable to muster a meaningful push back against the jihadists and is under intense pressure to support the Yazidis with air strikes and food drops. A series of spectacular defeats has seriously eroded its credibility. Baghdad claimed on Wednesday that its military had carried out an air strike on a Mosul prison which killed scores of jihadists and freed an unknown number of prisoners. The area was impossible to access and the numbers of fatalities could not be verified. However, witnesses reported damage to the prison and relatives rushed to the gates in the hope of rescuing detained family members.\n\nKurdish Peshmurga troops, long regarded as a more formidable fighting force, had been defending Sinjar, but they too were forced to withdraw as Isis advanced. Kurdish officials say their forces were seriously outgunned by the jihadists, who were using heavy weapons looted from Iraqi bases.\n\nThe same weapons are being used to consolidate Isis’s hold on much of western Iraq. The group has significantly boosted its numbers by tapping into Iraq’s estranged Sunni population, which has been marginalised by the Shia majority government since the US overthrow of Saddam Hussein more than 11 years ago.\n\n“I would say there are now between 30,000 and 50,000 of them,” Hashimi said. “Of those, I would say 30% are ideologues. The others have joined out of fear or coercion.”\n\nThe once dominant US military and powerful embassy now play next to no role in Iraq, with Iraqi militias reporting to Iranian generals increasingly taking the lead in the fight against the jihadists.\n\n“Iraq is spiralling out of control,” said Ali Khedery, the former longest-serving US official in Baghdad. “The centrifugal forces are spinning so quickly. They are on one timeline and Washington is on another. I am beyond concerned.”\n\nKhedery, who reported to five US ambassadors and three US central command generals and is now chairman of the Dubai-based consultancy Dragoman Partners, said: “Everybody is retreating to their corners. And there is no credible international actor that I can see that is trying to bring it together again.\n\n“It definitely is an existential threat to the Iraqi government and I think it represents yet another manifestation of the disintegration of Iraq as we know it.\n\n“Iranian overreach, the genocide in Syria, [Nouri] al-Maliki’s consolidation of power in a very sectarian way, have all led to the disillusionment, the disenfranchisement of the Sunni Arabs, who have fatally, but perhaps understandably, chosen to consummate a deal with the devil. Now we are locked in a race to the bottom.”\n\nDo you have the blessed hope? Order your free gospel tracts from kristinsfriends.com. Start your tract ministry today.",

imbalance with the ability to record pictures and video on almost every cell phone in use today its rare to not see the aftermath of accidents disasters and wars captured with immediacy and made available for the world to see there is no lack of desire to see images more and more horrific in nature mainstream media has standards of what they can not show and often warn or black out images deemed too graphic but standards relax and what was unacceptable to show 20 or 30 years ago is now common place on nightly news we can attribute these growingly macabre desires to the god of this corrupt age and the influence he has unleashed on this world but satan has been at work since his deception in the garden and mankinds lust for gore is not a new one king david was given a heart wrenching decree by god because he gloried in bloodshed but god said to me you shall not build a house for my name because you have been a man of war and have shed blood 1 chronicles 283 christ said that david was a man after my own heart acts 1322 but more importantly we know that david had gods spirit like each one of us with that same spirit david saw the world with his eyes opened by god but he stumbled because of his love of war and bloodshed and was not allowed to build a physical house for god living as a christian in this world is difficult the subtleties in how we interact on a daily basis can form lasting habits and those habits can either direct us toward godliness or away from it its too easy to mirror the standards of this society and grow accepting and accustomed to the comfort it appears to give but true christianity should find no comfort in the beliefs of this age but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation his own special people that you may proclaim the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light 1 peter 29 each of us must strive to build a spiritual house—one that god would desire his spirit to dwell within it is imperative then for our eternal existence that we let our conduct be worthy of the gospel of christ so that whether i come and see you or am absent i may hear of your affairs that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel philippians 127 living a christian life is not about what i cant do but instead what i should be doing with that mindset we can conduct ourselves in a manner suitable for christ current events this week in the news in this edition we are mainly focusing on three ongoing wars or military conflicts—the gaza war the murderous advancements of isis as well as turkeys involvement and americas response coupled with domestic problems in iraq and the fear of russias invasion in eastern ukraine it seems man tries to find salvation and monetary advantages in war but war will never bring about lasting peace hamas reign of terror the times of israel reported on august 12 israel may wish that gazas dire situation would push residents of the strip to rise up against their hamas rulers but more than a month into operation protective edge there are very few indications of that happening bassem eid a veteran jerusalembased human rights activist and political analyst said that gazans are reluctant to demonstrate for fear of hamas hamas has a physical presence in almost every house in gaza and can listen to whats being said its a stasi regime par excellence he continued referring to the east german secret police notorious for its eavesdropping capabilities the population is much more scared of hamas than it is of the israeli soldiers eid said hamas for its part is more worried about the possible return of control of the gaza strip to the palestinian authority than it is of an israeli military incursion palestinian authority media repeatedly gives credence to eids reports of an atmosphere of terror in gaza official palestinian news agency wafa has told of fatah activists being placed under house arrest by hamas from the early days of the israeli operation fatahs official facebook page reported shots being fired at the legs of fatah members including the bodyguards of fatah official abdullah ifranji but mkheimer abusada a political science professor at gazas alazhar university said that antihamas demonstrations were unlikely to emerge in a society which largely regards israel as the main cause of its suffering even if theres anger at hamas people are mostly angry at israel abusada told the times of israel in a phone conversation from gaza hamas may bear responsibility for the war but its israel which is destroying homes and killing civilians of almost 2000 deaths reported by health officials in the hamasrun strip israel says 7501000 are hamas and other gunmen hamas and other armed factions in gaza have launched over 3000 rockets and mortar shells into israel during operation protective edge many of them from densely populated areas israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has charged hamas with using the civilian population in gaza as human shields — firing rockets and building tunnels from residential areas providing gazans with no protection and sometimes even urging civilians to remain in fighting zones despite idf warnings — while hamass leadership has taken to hiding in underground tunnels but abusada indicated that gazans viewed themselves as victims of israel not hamas there is a reason why hamas has been rightly classified as a terrorist organization all the sugarcoating by analysts such as professor abusuda notwithstanding it is surprising that people can not see what is really going on of course one looks for a scapegoat and israel has always been an easy target this has been prophesied to occur especially in these end times there will be miracles� if you believe� jews news wrote on august 6 an israeli commander claimed that hundreds of israeli lives were saved recently when the hand of god stopped a hamas rocket a missile was fired from gaza iron dome precisely calculated its trajectory we know where these missiles are going to land down to a radius of 200 meters this particular missile was going to hit either the azrieli towers the kirya israels equivalent of the pentagon or a central tel aviv railway station hundreds could have died we fired the first interceptor it missed second interceptor it missed this is very rare i was in shock at this point we had just four seconds until the missile lands we had already notified emergency services to converge on the target location and had warned of a masscasualty incident suddenly iron dome which calculates wind speeds among other things shows a major wind coming from the east a strong wind that sends the missile into the sea we were all stunned one hamas member was asked why they couldnt aim their rockets better and actually hit an israeli target he responded we do aim them but their god changes their path in midair the first prime minister of israel david ben gurion said this once in israel in order to be a realist you must believe in miracles israel�s existence has nothing to do with the bible yes news wrote on august 3 in a special interview with die tagespost last week latin patriarch of jerusalem fouad twal named by pope benedict to represent the vatican in the jewish state declared that israels existence as such has nothing to do with the bible he then compared christians condition in todays jerusalem with jesus passion we christians never forget that even our lord himself suffered and was mocked in jerusalem a few days ago patriarch twal responded enthusiastically to the agreement reached between hamas and fatah he also denounced the judaization of jerusalem and attacked israel for trying to transform it into an only hebrewjewish city excluding the other faiths twals position on israel and the bible has been embraced at the highest levels in the catholic church the vatican synod in 2010 declared that israel can not use the biblical concept of a promised land or a chosen people perhaps a review of both the bible and historical evidence might be helpful to these so called scholars and theologians israel�s monetary costs of the gaza war the times of israel wrote on august 12 through last week including both direct military expenses and indirect hits to the israeli economy the total cost of the fourweek conflict is estimated at 25 billion to 36 billion for instance iron dome intercepted 584 of the hamas rockets — at 50000 a piece that comes to a total of 29 million or about 1 million per day israeli planes have bombed gaza approximately 4900 times during the war — roughly 150 times a day each of the air forces 4900 sorties cost 15000 for a total of over 73 million what a terrible waste of money while millions of people starve for lack of food little progress at cairo truce talks jta wrote on august 12 negotiators at the israelhamas truce talks in cairo said they were still far from an agreement palestinian officials said tuesday that the current threeday ceasefire between the sides will be the final one unless israel and hamas make progress toward a truce the ceasefire which began monday is the second threeday truce between the sides after a month of fighting hamas is demanding an end to israels blockade of the gaza strip and the building of an airport and seaport and israel is demanding gazas demilitarization it was announced on august 14 that hamas and israel agreed to extend the truce for five days to continue negotiations in the egyptian capital however there will be no lasting peace in the middle east until jesus christ returns waiting too long to stop isis breitbart wrote on august 8 yazidis in iraq are telling stories of mass murder and rape to their relatives abroad including in israel according to der spiegel online dated august 11 yazidis is an ancient premuslim religious community with roots in zoroastrianism whose members worship seven angels including a peacock angel in addition to god obama announced action against the islamic state as if that chamber of horrors sprang into existence last night and he immediately leaped into action against it nonsense hes known this stuff was happening for weeks and months contrary to his feeble excuses about learning everything at the same time we do by watching the news he gets presidential intelligence briefings the brutality shown by isis toward christians has been a matter of record for a long time and obama said nothing no surprise the islamists are even more brutal toward the yazidis who they consider devil worshipers this was all as predictable as the sunrise but obama did nothing said nothing until global media lit up with pictures of those fifty thousand people stranded on the slopes of the mountain that looms above their ancestral homeland dying of hunger and exposure foreign policy is all about timing stopping isis when it was on the move into mosul with an almost laughably small initial invasion force that nevertheless caused iraqi forces to break and run would have been relatively simple ejecting them from their conquered territory is impossible with only a few targeted bombing runs theyre mixed in with civilian targets now and they wont hesitate to take hostages they can threaten to blow up the mosul dams theyre far stronger better armed and better financed than they were when they first came across the syrian border and no matter what happens next theres no way to bring back the people isis has already murdered no way to undo the rape and pillage obama treats foreign policy like hes in college writing a thesis about something that happened a long time ago but the present is bad and the future might be worse if isis uses its manpower and resources to launch terror strikes in the west something they are very interested in doing the same people trying to cover for obamas incompetence today will be asking why nobody stopped the islamic state long ago when it could have been done with relative ease sunnis and turks support isis der spiegel online wrote on august 11 the is advance would hardly be possible without support from iraqi sunnis the american air strikes on is positions still wont solve the fundamental conflicts in these two countries the lack of strong governments in iraq and syria has allowed the is to operate freely in large swaths of the region the turks have sealed the border to kurds attempting to flee at the same time turkish officials are doing hardly anything to hinder jihadists who travel in and out of turkish airports as they make their way into the region isis wants conflict with usa newsmax wrote on august 10 isis has said it desires a direct conflict with the united states on american soil and the current conflict may also be serving as a lure for new members isis has stated it intends to form a caliphate or muslim religious state and is known for its brutality including beheadings of nonmuslims and even nonsunnis it formerly was an alqaida affiliate but broke from the group after alqaida criticized it for its tactics members of the iraqi army laid down their arms and fled earlier this year as isis forces advanced as a result isis now possesses american weapons left for the government of iraqi prime minister nouri almalaki it also has raided banks and taken over oil wells adding to its power of isiss estimated 10000 members up to half are thought to be from outside iraq and syria and about 100 americans are thought to have tried or succeeded in traveling to isis territory that troubles us officials because they fear those americans could return to launch terror attacks on the homeland iraq�s political turmoil �shiites vs shiites the new york times wrote on august 11 iraqs president formally nominated a candidate on monday to replace prime minister nuri kamal almaliki the step broke a monthslong political deadlock but it also seemed to take iraq into uncharted territory as mr maliki gave no signal that he was willing to relinquish power the obama administration which has been pushing iraqi lawmakers to name a replacement for mr maliki added to the pressure on him by welcoming the nomination of the candidate haider alabadi a member of mr malikis own shiite islamist dawa party the nomination of mr abadi came hours after a dramatic latenight television appearance in which a defiant mr maliki challenged the iraqi president fuad masum and threatened legal action for not choosing him as the nominee the united states has been reluctant to help the iraqi government militarily as long as it is led by mr maliki a shiite islamist who is seen by many as exacerbating sectarian and ethnic tensions alienating some sunnis and driving them to join the militants the washington post wrote on august 11 iraqs president chose a veteran shiite politician to lead the government on monday setting the stage for a vicious political showdown in a country already struggling to contain an extremist islamist insurgency in his eight years in power maliki has consolidated power in his hands ruling in a dictatorial style that has chipped away at his support among fellow shiites and sunnis alike he is widely blamed for the fostering of an environment that has allowed for sunni extremists from the islamic state to seize control of huge chunks of iraqi territory bbc news reported on august 14 that due to worldwide pressure maliki stepped down the article stated iraqi prime minister nouri maliki has stepped aside ending political deadlock in baghdad as the government struggles against insurgents he resigned on state tv to make way for haider alabadi who was asked by iraqs president to form a government mr maliki had been under intense pressure to make way for mr abadi a deputy speaker of parliament there had been fears that mr maliki might use the power base he built up through his control of the armed forces to stay in power but with his own party and the shia clerical establishment not to mention influential outside powers such as iran and america and the entire international community backing mr abadi the writing was clearly on the wall for mrmalikis hopes of clinging to power usa provides weapons to kurds the telegraph wrote on august 11 the obama administration has begun directly providing weapons to kurdish forces who have started to make gains against islamic militants in northern iraq but the aid has so far been limited to automatic rifles and ammunition previously the us only sold arms to the government in baghdad some of which would then be transferred to the kurdish forces in the north germany might send weapons to iraq the local wrote on august 12 germany said on tuesday it was ready to send nonlethal military aid such as armoured vehicles to help iraq push back against the advance of islamist insurgents defence minister ursula von der leyen said that aside from humanitarian aid germany could possibly send equipment such as helmets nightvision equipment boobytrap detectors and medical supplies for iraqi soldiers von der leyen reiterated her governments official position that germany as a rule does not send arms into conflict zones but added that if a genocide loomed in iraq this question should be debated intensively in germany several german politicians across the party spectrum including vice chancellor sigmar gabriel have suggested the rule may have to be reviewed in light of the is onslaught across vast areas of northern iraq foreign minister frankwalter steinmeier also signalled a willingness to pave the way for german weapons shipments to support baghdad citing the existential threat posed by the is sending weapons to volatile areas is never without great risk but it is interesting that the german stance on the matter is apparently changing back into iraq the huffington post wrote on august 11 obama has stated that the us will not become the iraqi governments air force such an unequivocal declaration though presupposes that there is a functional substitute and one that will be available in time to deal with military threats of the first order that could emerge literally any day so this is a typical obama fudge barack obama is a temporizer a devotee of halfmeasures too clever by half as with his timetable limited minisurge in afghanistan in 2009 he too often deceives himself that verbal declarations or pat phrases constitute a policy or program although the preferred course of action is far from clear evasion of the tough issues and postponement of hard choices will lower the odds on coming up with wise decisions once they have to be taken what are obamas timeframes they seem to be confused certainly there are no signs of a general strategy emerging in washington what role explicit tacit or pantomime for other outside powers eg iran turkey syria and egypt on this question too we have no signs of the obama administrations overall thinking much less the outlines of a strategy this is a major liability and potentially highly dangerous regarding the presidents time frame the washington post wrote on august 12 obama vacations as the world burns clinton vs obama newsmax wrote on august 10 former secretary of state hillary clinton has put the largest amount of space yet between herself and a rapidly moreunpopular president barack obama calling his refusal to build up a credible fighting force in syria to battle the assad regime a failure that led to jihadists such as the islamic state isis moving in goldberg notes in his article that clintons separation from obama was only a matter of time and as she comes closer to announcing her own candidacy she was notably more blunt in her interview with him deutsche welle added on august 11 clinton is basically a believer in the use of military force for humanitarian purposes and is less sensitive than president obama is says david c unger the longtime member of the new york times editorial board as obamas previous secretary of state clinton had strongly argued for arming the syrian opposition but that argument lost out against a more cautious approach generally favored by obama and others in the administration arming the rebels the daily beast wrote on august 11 the argument that america should have done more in syria made for years by foreign policy leaders in both parties and several members of obamas senior national security team was brought back to the fore this past weekend obama and hillary clinton gave dueling interviews in which they publicly split on whether the security and humanitarian catastrophe in syria could have been avoided if the united states had played a larger role obamas outburst on july 31 one week prior reveals the criticism was already getting to him even before the white house tried to deflect clintons remarks as prepresidential political posturing just before the congressional recess president obama invited over a dozen senate and house leaders from both parties to the white house to talk about foreign policy according to two lawmakers inside the meeting obama became visibly agitated when confronted by bipartisan criticism of the white houses policy of slowrolling moderate syrian rebels repeated requests for arms to fight the assad regime and isis according to one of the lawmakers sen bob corker asked the president a long question that included sharp criticisms of president obamas handling of a number of foreign policy issues—including syria isis russia and ukraine obama answered corker at length but days after the white house meeting corker wrote a blistering oped for the washington post criticizing obamas handling of foreign policy today after three years of bold rhetoric divorced from reality 170000 syrians are dead and we are not innocent bystanders the president encouraged the opposition to swallow deadly risks then left them mostly hanging the senator wrote extremist groups from syria have surged into iraq seizing key territory and resources and are threatening to completely undo the progress of years of us sacrifice top democratic lawmakers agreed with corker and clinton that doing more to support the moderate rebels would have at least had a chance of averting or mitigating the current crisis which has now spread to large parts of iraq as isis expands its newly declared caliphate in a new york times interview published aug 8 obama said that the idea arming the rebels would have made a difference had always been a fantasy this idea that we could provide some light arms or even more sophisticated arms to what was essentially an opposition made up of former doctors farmers pharmacists and so forth and that they were going to be able to battle not only a wellarmed state but also a wellarmed state backed by russia backed by iran a battlehardened hezbollah that was never in the cards obama said not all lawmakers support arming the rebels sen rand paul for example is on the record opposing the use of us military resources to fight isis in iraq or syria also clinton and many lawmakers acknowledge that arming the rebels was risky and might not have worked the weapons couldve fallen into the extremists hands arming rebels is indeed a very dangerous endeavor now the discussion has shifted to arming the kurds and others in iraq to defend against isis as previous articles discuss however todays friends can very quickly become tomorrows enemies osama bin laden and saddam hussein are prime examples the lawless united states�always at war somewhere the huffington post wrote on august 10 ukraine gaza syria yemen pakistan if it feels like the united states is always at war somewhere thats because it is not just iraq and afghanistan the two wars we all know about and granted were not only talking boots on the ground its our money our weapons and more often in recent weeks our secretary of state engaged in highstakes diplomacy to uneven results investigative journalist kevin gosztola put the us war count at 74 these are mostly unannounced and undeclared wars against enemies that have different aspirations strategies and ideologies while the eyes of the american media and public might have shifted back to iraq for now just a week ago they were momentarily back on afghanistan in another example of how dangerous the country still is for our military we heard about the killing of major general harold greene who was killed by an afghan soldier in a greenonblue gunfire exchange three in four americans believe that history will judge the war in afghanistan a failure what we are leaving behind is in fact more war and more terror what were leaving behind in terms of our reputation is the idea of american lawlessness our lawlessness doesnt just hurt us abroad lawlessness has encroached into the uss domestic affairs with the nsas almost orwellian reach into civic life there is indeed a connection between fighting in war and engaging in lawlessness please read our free booklets should you fight in war and and lawlessness will abound wild west in ferguson missouri the washington post wrote on august 14 the killing of 18yearold michael brown by a police officer in ferguson mo has produced a rare and surprisingly unified response across the ideological spectrum with republicans and democrats joining to decry the tactics of the citys police force in the face of escalating protests sen rand paul rky criticized what he called the growing militarization of local police forces the images of police in riot gear with armored vehicles and heavy weaponry shooting a teargas canister at an al jazeera camera crew have drawn alarming reactions from the left and the right the rough treatment and detainment of two journalists wesley lowery of the washington post and ryan reilly of the huffington post has added to the public outrage about the ferguson police departments handling of the protests over browns killing erdogan becomes head of state in turkey� is this bad for the world deutsche welle wrote on august 11 the turkish presidential election is decided outgoing prime minister recep tayyip erdogan will become head of state ie president its a bitter win and not just for opponents of further islamization the outcome was fully democratic and therefore irrefutable thats one side of the coin but on the other side is the fear that turkey could now head further down the path of transformation into an islamic republic with increasing religious requirements for citizens in everyday life with erdogans victory the secular reforms of turkeys founder mustafa kemal ataturk fall further to pieces erdogan was chosen because he gave the turkish people a whole new sense of selfesteem based on religious values surrounded by ongoing crises in places like iraq and syria and the conflicts in gazaisrael and ukrainerussia not to mention the recently renewed fighting between azerbaijan and armenia over the nagornokarabakh region erdogan must overcome fears that he will only add fuel to these fires its something he has often done in the past the eu and especially germany will have to cope with an increasingly uncomfortable relationship with erdogan der spiegel online wrote on august 6 erdogan 60 has been in power for 11 years and because he can no longer serve as prime minister after three terms in office he has now been elected as president he has become more and more authoritarian with each election win he has had protests quelled and critics arrested and has gradually implemented islamic moral values istanbul law professor bertan tokuzlu believes that erdogan will transform turkey into a oneman state once and for all erdogan himself makes no secret of how he intends to govern in the future in a television interview in late july he announced his intention to introduce a presidential system and he cited china and russia as models turkey will continue to play a very controversial role in the near future for more information please read our free booklet middle eastern and african nations in bible prophecy �high probability� for russian invasion in eastern ukraine the new york times wrote on august 11 the prospect of a russian intervention in eastern ukraine appeared to rise sharply on monday threatening to take to new lows what is already the sharpest eastwest confrontation of the postcold war era as the kremlin announced it had sent a convoy of humanitarian aid to ukraine under the auspices of the international red cross the secretarygeneral of nato said there was a high probability of a russian attack with increasing urgency western governments have condemned in advance any russian aid missions which they fear could serve as a pretext for a military incursion to support hardpressed prorussian separatists fighting the ukrainian army in the countrys southeast en route russian �aid� convoy will be denied access deutsche welle reported on august 12 just hours after russia deployed 280 trucks carrying humanitarian aid to eastern ukraine on tuesday morning a spokesperson from ukraines military said the convoy would be denied access at the border pointing out that russias army was managing the convoy and that its contents had not been verified by the icrc red cross the aid column is expected to complete its 1000kilometer 600mile journey from moscow to eastern ukraine within two to three days french president francois hollande said that he had grave concerns prompted by the possibility of a unilateral russian mission on ukrainian soil according to nato roughly 45000 russian soldiers have been deployed to russias southwest close to the countrys border with ukraine the euobserver added on august 12 the red cross says it has no agreement to govern what will happen when russian aid trucks arrive at ukraines border the un estimates that some 168000 people have fled from east ukraine to russia over the past three months of fighting while another 117000 people have become internally displaced the red cross said on monday the situation is critical thousands of people are reported to be without access to water electricity and medical aid the bible shows that ultimately russia and ukraine will collaborate and become friends at least temporarily for more information please read our free booklet biblical prophecy from now until forever see also our qa on the prophetic relationship between russia ukraine and continental europe q a what are major reasons leading to the downfall and dismantling of our former association the worldwide church of god many of the writers and reviewers of this publication once belonged to a different church organization for the purpose of this qa it does not matter whether or not you as the reader are familiar with that organization even if you have never heard of that organization the following should still be very revealing the organization referred to the worldwide church of god under its human leader herbert w armstrong who died in 1986 had taught the truth for decades a few years after its founder died the new leadership began to introduce doctrinal changes the changes were subtly introduced and it was claimed at the time that they were just clarifications or changes in terminology before explaining in detail what actually happened let us examine the nation of israel and the building of the first temple under king solomon to extract historical lessons from it when a nation or a church organization is pleasing god through faithful obedience god blesses that nation or church the first temple at jerusalem was a most magnificent building we can read about the queen of sheba a person who was used to opulence and grandeur when she came to visit solomon and viewed the temple the servants and all that solomon had done she fainted we read in 1 kings 1015 in the authorized version and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard questions and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart and solomon told her all her questions there was not anything hid from the king which he told her not and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomons wisdom and the house that he had built and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her yet in spite of all the gold silver and costly things in the temple and in jerusalem the temple was subsequently completely destroyed why did god allow this after all even the ark of the covenant was placed in this beautiful temple we can read in the book of ezra that at the time when the second temple was built the people wept because they had seen the spendour of the first temple under solomon and this second house did not remotely compare to it ezra 31012 states authorized version and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the lord they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the levites the sons of asaph with cymbals to praise the lord after the ordinance of david king of israel and they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the lord because he is good for his mercy endureth for ever toward israel and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the lord because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid but many of the priests and levites and chief of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy later jesus warned the disciples that the second temple which had been greatly beautified by herod would also be destroyed this occurred in 70 ad under titus god allowed the destruction of the first and second temples because of sinful conduct and behaviour sin if not dealt with is destructive to a nation a church and an individual the worldwide church of gods auditorium in pasadena california was one of the nicest buildings in the us with near perfect acoustics for anyone speaking from or singing on stage important people lectured there and worldrenown artists played and performed there was an inscription in gold letters on the wall of the entryway stating in part dedicated to the great god yet today the auditorium and the entire college campus are no longer in the hands of church members and many of the buildings on campus have been torn down so what happened the worldwide church of god has collapsed—even its name was changed so technically it does no longer exist and the churchs three colleges in pasadena bricket wood england and big sandy texas are no longer operated by the church let us realize how sinful doctrinal compromise and false teachings led to the entire downfall of the worldwide church of god organization it all really started with a new understanding regarding the born again teaching as we explain in our free booklet are you already born again we are begotten when we receive the holy spirit but not yet born the worldwide church of god under herbert armstrong understood and taught this but the new leadership after mr armstrongs death was very anxious to change this teaching and to proclaim that we are already born again when we receive gods spirit why were they determined to do this why was satans first major attack on the doctrines of the church directed towards that very teaching on born again satan is not stupid his agenda is and was to be worshipped as god and to replace the one and true god as supreme commander of the universe satan is also very subtle he is an expert at deception and lying the great commission to the church of god is to preach and publish the gospel of the kingdom of god to the world as a witness and to feed the flock at the very core of this gospel message is the knowledge and understanding about born again and the fact that god is reproducing himself through mankind mans potential is to become a bornagain immortal god being in the family or kingdom of god in satans eyes the dismantling and changing of this understanding was crucial to bringing the church down since that knowledge also includes the fact that as sons and daughters of god we will replace satan and the demons as the present rulers of this world corrupting this understanding was just like placing a virus in a computer corrupting it was crucial in satans efforts to ultimately destroy the worldwide church of god christ is the head of the church of god which is a spiritual organism it operates through human organizations if you think of a church organization as a body it stands on two legs the doctrine of born again was one leg which satan wanted to cut off the other leg which had to be cut off in satans mind was the correct understanding about the nature of godthe knowledge that god is a family currently consisting of two members this knowledge is crucial to the gospel message since it also helps us to understand our ultimate destiny slowly turning that correct understanding to the pagan and unbiblical doctrine of the trinity in all its various forms was cutting the second leg from the body which caused the body to fall and the worldwide church of god has never recovered from that fall these two doctrines are crucial in order for us to stand as a church and they are also crucial for the gospel message to be properly understood in order to spiritually survive today we must never let go or compromise on those two doctrines if we do then the understanding of other doctrines will also be lost over a period of time changing true doctrines and teaching spiritual error is sin the worldwide church of god organization with its many buildings and campuses was destroyed because of the sinful and misleading conduct and doctrinal error of its leadership after herbert armstrongs death and the many ministers and members who accepted these false teachings lets fully understand the destructiveness of sin regardless of the grandeur and spendour of solomons temple the temple in jesus time and the ambassador auditorium in pasadena they were destroyed or polluted and the auditorium and the pasadena campus of the worldwide church of god are now in the hands of sundayworshippers –all because of sin thats why it is so crucial not to compromise with doctrine but to stick to the trunk of the tree and not to get sidetracked from the commission of the church of preaching the true gospel which contains the only hope for mankind in our free booklet are you already born again we describe in detail the doctrinal downfall of the worldwide church of god from its unique correct scriptural understanding to an appalling blasphemous apostasy when the change on born again came some noted that this would ultimately lead to a change regarding the nature of god and the potential of man a few years later those changes anticipated by some actually had taken place how could anyone have foreseen this development simply because the correct born again understanding goes hand in hand with other important biblical concepts and teachings when we understand that christians—those who have received the holy spirit—are begotten of the father we also understand that the father is reproducing himself through us we understand that god is a family and that god wants to enlarge his family through us we also understand that christ the son of god and the firstborn among many brethren will marry his church at the time of his return revelation 197–9 matthew 222 2510 ephesians 531–32 one important principle taught in the bible is that a kind only reproduces according to its own kind this shows that christ will not marry a church that is physical christ is god—a spirit being christ will only marry spirit beings we understand that we are not yet spirit beings we also understand however that we will be spirit beings at the time of our resurrection and change to immortality then we will be spirit then we will be born again then christ will marry us and not before all of these biblical concepts go together after we are begotten of gods spirit we have to grow in christs knowledge we have to become perfect matthew 548 the receipt of the holy spirit is just the beginning of our journey toward perfection and ultimate entrance into the kingdom of god we understand too that the kingdom of god has not yet come christ has not yet established the kingdom of god on earth he will do so when he returns at that time we will be in the kingdom of god why because we will be god—and god is a kingdom—the family of god ruling over creation since christs death made it possible that man can become god and since christ will rule as king of kings and lord of lords in this kingdom under god the father the gospel message also includes information about christ himself however the gospel message goes beyond the person of christ its a message brought by christ—not a message limited to the personage of christ we understand that our ultimate salvation is still in the future—that we will be saved when we enter gods kingdom—at which time we will be god in time we heard the terminology of a gospel about christ or that christ was the gospel at the same time we were taught that the kingdom although still future to an extent had already arrived that we were already in the kingdom and that christ would only come to inaugurate the kingdom we were also taught that we were already saved all of these new teachings were logical extensions of the false understanding of born again if we were already born again then we could see and enter the kingdom therefore so the reasoning went since we were already born again we were already in the kingdom and already saved since we were already saved we were gradually taught that we didnt have to grow anymore in christs knowledge as how to keep the law since the law was allegedly no longer in force and effect no more ten commandments let alone any commanded observance of gods annual holy days as christ supposedly did away with them all christs statement that we can not see the kingdom was incorrectly interpreted in a way that he was merely talking about perceiving the powers of the kingdom of course these socalled new concepts also required a redefinition of what the bible says about the kingdom of god then we were told that it is incorrect to say that god is a family—rather we should say that god has a family with that subtle change the truth of the nature of god began to become obscure if god were not a family then god was not reproducing himself either again we see the logical consequence of the born again change this then led to the ultimate change regarding the nature of god god was no longer perceived as consisting of two beings god the father and god the son but as just one being since god was no longer a family there was no longer a duality in the godhead either clear scriptures proving the duality of the godhead were reinterpreted twisted or simply ignored we were also taught that god although one person represents himself within a threefold mode of being a clever argument was presented that a person can have three functions—that of a father a husband and a president in other words god was described as consisting of the father the son and the holy spirit but these three functions were not persons but hypostases this concept had been adopted from a greek orthodox idea that stemmed from pagan greeks like plato and aristotle it was then reasoned that jesus christ was a created being who did not exist prior to his human birth so we suddenly were introduced to god one person in three hypostases and christ another—created—person who was or somehow became a son but separate and apart from the sonhypostasis of the godperson we were even told that the son was still in heaven as one of the three hypostases while christ was here on earth and that the son remained alive when christ the physical person died with that idea the supreme sacrifice of christ had been denied and rejected to add further to the confusion and heresy we were subsequently told without any explanation that god was a trinity the same concept taught by the catholic church and most protestant churches—one person in three persons no longer hypostases as previously represented christ had now become part of the trinity although it remained unclear what he was before he became man what he was when he was here on earth and what he became after his resurrection god in any event had become a closed trinity since he was no longer a family man could not become a part of that family it was taught that god would adopt christians but christians would never become gods real sons and daughters god was no longer reproducing himself through man it was taught that god was creating or building a somewhat figurative family however god was no longer adding to the very family that he is and that he always has been christians were no longer understood as becoming members of the very god family with god being their true and real father and christ being their true and real elder brother without the born again change the subsequent changes could not have occurred it is therefore imperative that we not tamper with the correct understanding of born again if we do even in seemingly unimportant areas of terminology or explanations we will change the proper understanding of what born again means and we will thereby open a floodgate of change again in the end we might very well find ourselves being totally void of all correct biblical understanding it happened before to those who apparently understood the truth at one time let us not think that it could not happen again he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says revelation 27 11 17 29 36 13 22 the bible tells us that a falling away from the truth is still to occur in the church of god just prior to the return of christ 2 thessalonians 213 if history is our guide then something very similar to the last apostasy in the worldwide church of god will happen again in gods church in the nottoodistant future even though we are clearly living today in the laodicea era of the church—which can be described as a big lukewarm social club without real zeal being filled with riches pride and selfdeception revelation 31418—there are still remnants of some of the previous eras in existence today one era is designated as sardis describing a church which has a name that it is living and alive but it is spiritually dead with works which are not perfect before god and only very few in that church have not defiled their garments and are worthy to be given white clothes revelation 31 another remnant is that of philadelphia revelation 3710 designating a faithful church with little strength which keeps christs word and which does not deny his name it stays faithful to the truth and refuses to compromise with doctrine only members with that philadelphia spirit are promised protection from the terrible times to come it is they who will not fall for the errors of doctrinal deception and only they will be spared from the clutches of the falling away from the truth which is still prophesied to happen if you are in a church organization which has begun to compromise with the faith once delivered to the saints jude 3—especially in the areas of born again and the gospel of the kingdom or family of god—then god tells you to come out of that spiritual babylon of confusion revelation 184 and to refuse to partake of its sins of false teachings if you have and embrace the truth make sure that you continue to hold on to it no matter what the circumstances and challenges may be lead writers rene messier and norbert link forum silence is truly golden by louise amorelli recently my husband and i have had events in our lives where there was little down time family matters and visits immediate and long term home repair attention summer landtree maintenance and other seemingly important responsibilities have been taking up a good chunk of our summer days it seems like one day was just a continuing previous day without end i started to ask myself lots of questions when is the down time do we have the right balance did we overextend ourselves in family mattersvisits and make the right decisions should we let some things go and in what order of importance should they be do we fully trust god that he will not give us more than we can bear what lessons is he teaching me but the one thing i realized most is that there was no quiet time no silence no time to meditate and reevaluate on these issues daily not only to rest physically but also to rest spiritually my body and brain were on overload and needed space and time to breathe things needed to change something was wrong i needed to stop and make that time to meditate on the days activities in how i did spiritually and how to improve and meditate on my choices without that meditation time i was just going from one day to the next without analyzing my actions against godly principles and making the necessary albeit difficult changes that god requires of me what amazed me is how satan can try and steal this very precious time i had better appreciate how important silence and meditation really are so that i can be a true beacon of light in this world and to be a help in gods kingdom to come after all its not all about the physical but about the spiritual i look forward to gods kingdom of true peace where there will be time for all to meditate on gods word in this fastpaced sataninspired world silence is not only

            "text": "Our society fulfills its desire for entertainment in an ever increasing level of shock and complete imbalance.  With the ability to record pictures and video on almost every cell phone in use today, it’s rare to not see the aftermath of accidents, disasters and wars captured with immediacy and made available for the world to see.  There is no lack of desire to see images more and more horrific in nature.  Mainstream media has standards of what they cannot show and often warn or black out images deemed too graphic.  But standards relax and what was unacceptable to show 20 or 30 years ago is now common place on nightly news.\n\n \n\n We can attribute these growingly macabre desires to the god of this corrupt age and the influence he has unleashed on this world.  But Satan has been at work since his deception in the garden and mankind’s lust for gore is not a new one.  King David was given a heart wrenching decree by God because he gloried in bloodshed: “But God said to me, 'You shall not build a house for My name, because you have been a man of war and have shed blood’” (1 Chronicles 28:3).  Christ said that David was “a man after My own heart” (Acts 13:22) but more importantly we know that David had God’s Spirit.  Like each one of us with that same Spirit, David saw the world with his eyes opened by God. But, he stumbled because of his love of war and bloodshed and was not allowed to build a physical house for God.\n\n \n\n Living as a Christian in this world is difficult.  The subtleties in how we interact on a daily basis can form lasting habits and those habits can either direct us toward godliness or away from it.  It’s too easy to mirror the standards of this society and grow accepting and accustomed to the comfort it appears to give.  But true Christianity should find no comfort in the beliefs of this age: “But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9).  \n\n \n\n Each of us must strive to build a spiritual house—one that God would desire His Spirit to dwell within.  It is imperative then, for our eternal existence, that we let our “conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel” (Philippians 1:27).  Living a Christian life is not about “what I can’t do” but instead “what I should be doing.\"  With that mindset we can conduct ourselves in a manner suitable for Christ.\n\nThis Week in the News In this edition, we are mainly focusing on three ongoing wars or military conflicts—the Gaza War; the murderous advancements of ISIS, as well as Turkey’s involvement and America’s response, coupled with domestic problems in Iraq; and the fear of Russia’s invasion in eastern Ukraine. \n\n \n\n It seems, man tries to find salvation (and monetary advantages) in war, but war will never bring about lasting peace. The Times of Israel reported on August 12:\n\n \n\n “Israel may wish that Gaza’s dire situation would push residents of the Strip to rise up against their Hamas rulers, but more than a month into Operation Protective Edge, there are very few indications of that happening…\n\n \n\n “Bassem Eid, a veteran Jerusalem-based human rights activist and political analyst, said that Gazans are reluctant to demonstrate for fear of Hamas… ‘Hamas has a physical presence in almost every house in Gaza and can listen to what’s being said. It’s a Stasi regime par excellence,’ he continued, referring to the East German secret police notorious for its eavesdropping capabilities…\n\n \n\n “‘The population is much more scared of Hamas than it is of the Israeli soldiers,’ Eid said. Hamas, for its part, is more worried about the possible return of control of the Gaza Strip to the Palestinian Authority than it is of an Israeli military incursion…\n\n \n\n “Palestinian Authority media repeatedly gives credence to Eid’s reports of an atmosphere of terror in Gaza. Official Palestinian news agency WAFA has told of Fatah activists being placed under house arrest by Hamas from the early days of the Israeli operation. Fatah’s official Facebook page reported shots being fired at the legs of Fatah members, including the bodyguards of Fatah official Abdullah Ifranji…\n\n \n\n “But Mkheimer Abusada, a political science professor at Gaza’s Al-Azhar University, said that anti-Hamas demonstrations were unlikely to emerge in a society which largely regards Israel as the main cause of its suffering. ‘Even if there’s anger at Hamas, people are mostly angry at Israel,’ Abusada told The Times of Israel in a phone conversation from Gaza. ‘Hamas may bear responsibility for the war, but it’s Israel which is destroying homes and killing civilians.’ (Of almost 2,000 deaths reported by health officials in the Hamas-run Strip, Israel says 750-1,000 are Hamas and other gunmen.)…\n\n \n\n “Hamas and other armed factions in Gaza have launched over 3,000 rockets and mortar shells into Israel during Operation Protective Edge, many of them from densely populated areas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has charged Hamas with using the civilian population in Gaza as ‘human shields’ — firing rockets and building tunnels from residential areas, providing Gazans with no protection, and sometimes even urging civilians to remain in fighting zones despite IDF warnings — while Hamas’s leadership has taken to hiding in underground tunnels. But Abusada indicated that Gazans viewed themselves as victims of Israel, not Hamas…” \n\n \n\n There is a REASON why Hamas has been rightly classified as a terrorist organization. All the sugarcoating by analysts such as Professor Abusuda notwithstanding, it is surprising that people cannot see what is really going on. Of course, one looks for a scapegoat, and Israel has always been an easy target. This has been prophesied to occur, especially in these end times.  There Will Be Miracles� If You Believe� Jews News wrote on August 6:\n\n \n\n “An Israeli commander claimed that hundreds of Israeli lives were saved recently when ‘the hand of God’ stopped a Hamas rocket:\n\n \n\n “‘A missile was fired from Gaza. Iron Dome precisely calculated [its trajectory]. We know where these missiles are going to land down to a radius of 200 meters. This particular missile was going to hit either the Azrieli Towers, the Kirya (Israel’s equivalent of the Pentagon) or [a central Tel Aviv railway station]. Hundreds could have died. We fired the first [interceptor]. It missed. Second [interceptor]. It missed. This is very rare. I was in shock. \n\n \n\n “‘At this point we had just four seconds until the missile lands. We had already notified emergency services to converge on the target location and had warned of a mass-casualty incident. Suddenly, Iron Dome (which calculates wind speeds, among other things) shows a major wind coming from the east, a strong wind that … sends the missile into the sea. We were all stunned…’\n\n \n\n “One Hamas member was asked why they couldn’t aim their rockets better and actually hit an Israeli target. He responded: ‘We do aim them, but their God changes their path in mid-air.’ The first prime minister of Israel, David Ben Gurion, said this once: ‘In Israel, in order to be a realist, you must believe in miracles.’” Israel�s Existence Has Nothing to Do with the Bible? Yes News wrote on August 3:\n\n \n\n “In a special interview with Die Tagespost last week, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Fouad Twal, named by Pope Benedict to represent the Vatican in the Jewish State, declared that ‘Israel’s existence as such has nothing to do with the Bible.’ He then compared Christians’ condition in today’s Jerusalem with Jesus’ Passion: ‘We Christians never forget that even our Lord himself suffered and was mocked in Jerusalem.’…\n\n \n\n “A few days ago, Patriarch Twal responded enthusiastically to the agreement reached between Hamas and Fatah. He also denounced ‘the Judaization of Jerusalem’ and attacked Israel for ‘trying to transform it into an only Hebrew-Jewish city, excluding the other faiths.’… Twal’s position on Israel and the Bible has been embraced at the highest levels in the Catholic Church. The Vatican synod in 2010 declared that Israel cannot use the Biblical concept of a promised land or a chosen people.”\n\n \n\n Perhaps a review of both the Bible and historical evidence might be helpful to these so called scholars and theologians! The Times of Israel wrote on August 12:\n\n \n\n “… through last week, including both direct military expenses and indirect hits to the Israeli economy, the total cost of the four-week conflict is estimated at $2.5 billion to $3.6 billion… [For instance] Iron Dome intercepted 584 of [the Hamas’ rockets] — at $50,000 a piece. That comes to a total of $29 million, or about $1 million per day…\n\n \n\n “Israeli planes have bombed Gaza approximately 4,900 times during the war — roughly 150 times a day… each of the Air Force’s 4,900 sorties cost $15,000, for a total of over $73 million…”\n\n \n\n What a terrible waste of money, while millions of people starve for lack of food. JTA wrote on August 12:\n\n \n\n “Negotiators at the Israel-Hamas truce talks in Cairo said they were still far from an agreement. Palestinian officials said Tuesday that the current three-day cease-fire between the sides will be the final one unless Israel and Hamas make progress toward a truce. The cease-fire, which began Monday, is the second three-day truce between the sides after a month of fighting…\n\n \n\n “Hamas is demanding an end to Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip and the building of an airport and seaport, and Israel is demanding Gaza’s demilitarization…”\n\n \n\nIt was announced on August 14 that Hamas and Israel agreed to extend the truce for five days to continue negotiations in the Egyptian capital. However, there will be no lasting peace in the Middle East until Jesus Christ returns. Breitbart wrote on August 8:\n\n \n\n “Yazidis in Iraq are telling stories of mass murder and rape to their relatives abroad - including in Israel… [According to Der Spiegel Online, dated August 11, “Yazidis [is] an ancient, pre-Muslim religious community, with roots in Zoroastrianism, whose members worship seven angels, including a peacock angel, in addition to god.”]\n\n \n\n “Obama announced action against the Islamic State as if that chamber of horrors sprang into existence last night, and he immediately leaped into action against it.  Nonsense.  He's known this stuff was happening for weeks and months.  Contrary to his feeble excuses about learning everything at the same time we do, by watching the news, he gets presidential intelligence briefings.  The brutality shown by ISIS toward Christians has been a matter of record for a long time, and Obama said nothing.  No surprise the Islamists are even more brutal toward the Yazidis, who they consider ‘devil worshipers.’\n\n \n\n “This was all as predictable as the sunrise, but Obama did nothing, said nothing, until global media lit up with pictures of those fifty thousand people stranded on the slopes of the mountain that looms above their ancestral homeland, dying of hunger and exposure…\n\n \n\n “Foreign policy is all about timing.  Stopping ISIS when it was on the move into Mosul - with an almost laughably small initial invasion force that nevertheless caused Iraqi forces to break and run - would have been relatively simple…  Ejecting them from their conquered territory is impossible with only a few targeted bombing runs.  They're mixed in with civilian targets now, and they won't hesitate to take hostages.  They can threaten to blow up the Mosul dams.  They're far stronger, better armed, and better financed than they were when they first came across the Syrian border…\n\n \n\n “And no matter what happens next, there's no way to bring back the people ISIS has already murdered, no way to undo the rape and pillage.  Obama treats foreign policy like he's in college writing a thesis about something that happened a long time ago.  But the present is bad, and the future might be worse.  If ISIS uses its manpower and resources to launch terror strikes in the West - something they are very interested in doing - the same people trying to cover for Obama's incompetence today will be asking why nobody stopped the Islamic State long ago, when it could have been done with relative ease…” Der Spiegel Online wrote on August 11:\n\n \n\n “The IS advance would hardly be possible without support from Iraqi Sunnis.\n\n \n\n “… the American air strikes on IS positions still won't solve the fundamental conflicts in these two countries… the lack of strong governments in Iraq and Syria has allowed the IS to operate freely in large swaths of the region…  the Turks have sealed the border to Kurds attempting to flee. At the same time, Turkish officials are doing hardly anything to hinder jihadists who travel in and out of Turkish airports as they make their way into the region…” Newsmax wrote on August 10:\n\n \n\n “ISIS has said it desires a direct conflict with the United States on American soil, and the current conflict may also be serving as a lure for new members… ISIS has stated it intends to form a caliphate, or Muslim religious state, and is known for its brutality, including beheadings, of non-Muslims and even non-Sunnis. It formerly was an al-Qaida affiliate, but broke from the group after al-Qaida criticized it for its tactics.\n\n \n\n “Members of the Iraqi army laid down their arms and fled earlier this year as ISIS forces advanced. As a result, ISIS now possesses American weapons left for the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki. It also has raided banks and taken over oil wells, adding to its power…\n\n \n\n “Of ISIS's estimated 10,000 members, up to half are thought to be from outside Iraq and Syria. And about 100 Americans are thought to have tried or succeeded in traveling to ISIS territory. That trouble[s] U.S. officials because they fear those Americans could return to launch terror attacks on the homeland.” The New York Times wrote on August 11:\n\n \n\n “Iraq’s president formally nominated a candidate on Monday to replace Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. The step broke a months-long political deadlock, but it also seemed to take Iraq into uncharted territory, as Mr. Maliki gave no signal that he was willing to relinquish power.\n\n \n\n “The Obama administration, which has been pushing Iraqi lawmakers to name a replacement for Mr. Maliki, added to the pressure on him by welcoming the nomination of the candidate, Haider al-Abadi, a member of Mr. Maliki’s own Shiite Islamist Dawa Party…\n\n \n\n “The nomination of Mr. Abadi came hours after a dramatic late-night television appearance in which a defiant Mr. Maliki challenged the Iraqi president, Fuad Masum, and threatened legal action for not choosing him as the nominee…\n\n \n\n “The United States has been reluctant to help the Iraqi government militarily as long as it is led by Mr. Maliki, a Shiite Islamist who is seen by many as exacerbating sectarian and ethnic tensions, alienating some Sunnis and driving them to join the militants…”\n\n \n\n The Washington Post wrote on August 11:\n\n \n\n “Iraq’s president chose a veteran Shiite politician to lead the government on Monday, setting the stage for a vicious political showdown in a country already struggling to contain an extremist Islamist insurgency…\n\n \n\n “In his eight years in power, Maliki has consolidated power in his hands, ruling in a dictatorial style that has chipped away at his support among fellow Shiites and Sunnis alike. He is widely blamed for the fostering [of] an environment that has allowed for Sunni extremists from the Islamic State to seize control of huge chunks of Iraqi territory…”  BBC News reported on August 14 that due to worldwide pressure, Maliki stepped down. The article stated:   “Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki has stepped aside, ending political deadlock in Baghdad as the government struggles against insurgents. He resigned on state TV to make way for Haider al-Abadi, who was asked by Iraq's president to form a government. Mr Maliki had been under intense pressure to make way for Mr Abadi, a deputy speaker of parliament… “There had been fears that Mr Maliki might use the power base he built up through his control of the armed forces to stay in power. But, with his own party and the Shia clerical establishment, not to mention influential outside powers such as Iran and America and the entire international community backing Mr Abadi, the writing was clearly on the wall for MrMaliki's hopes of clinging to power.” The Telegraph wrote on August 11:\n\n \n\n “The Obama administration has begun directly providing weapons to Kurdish forces who have started to make gains against Islamic militants in northern Iraq, but the aid has so far been limited to automatic rifles and ammunition. \n\n \n\n “Previously, the US only sold arms to the government in Baghdad, some of which would then be transferred to the Kurdish forces in the north.” The Local wrote on August 12:\n\n \n\n “Germany said on Tuesday it was ready to send non-lethal military aid such as armoured vehicles to help Iraq push back against the advance of Islamist insurgents… Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said that, aside from humanitarian aid, Germany could possibly send equipment such as helmets, night-vision equipment, booby-trap detectors and medical supplies for Iraqi soldiers… \n\n \n\n “Von der Leyen reiterated her government's official position that Germany as a rule does not send arms into conflict zones but added that, if a ‘genocide’ loomed in Iraq, this question should be ‘debated intensively’ in Germany.\n\n \n\n “Several German politicians across the party spectrum, including Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, have suggested the rule may have to be reviewed in light of the IS onslaught across vast areas of northern Iraq. Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier also signalled a willingness to pave the way for German weapons shipments to support Baghdad, citing the ‘existential threat’ posed by the IS…”\n\n \n\n Sending weapons to volatile areas is never without great risk. But it is interesting that the German stance on the matter is apparently changing. The Huffington Post wrote on August 11:\n\n \n\n “Obama has stated that the U.S. will not become the Iraqi government's air force. Such an unequivocal declaration, though, presupposes that there is a functional substitute -- and one that will be available in time to deal with military threats of the first order that could emerge literally any day. So, this is a typical Obama fudge. Barack Obama is a temporizer, a devotee of half-measures, ‘too clever by half’ as with his time-table limited mini-surge in Afghanistan in 2009. \n\n \n\n “… He too often deceives himself that verbal declarations or pat phrases constitute a policy or program. Although the preferred course of action is far from clear, evasion of the tough issues and postponement of hard choices will lower the odds on coming up with wise decisions once they have to be taken…\n\n \n\n “What are Obama's time-frames? They seem to be confused… Certainly, there are no signs of a general strategy emerging in Washington.\n\n \n\n “What role (explicit, tacit, or pantomime) for other outside powers, e.g. Iran, Turkey, Syria and Egypt?... On this question, too, we have no signs of the Obama administration's overall thinking -- much less the outlines of a strategy… This is a major liability and potentially highly dangerous…”\n\n \n\n Regarding the President’s time frame, the Washington Post wrote on August 12: “Obama vacations as the world burns.” “Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has put the largest amount of space yet between herself and a rapidly more-unpopular President Barack Obama, calling his refusal to ‘build up a credible fighting force’ in Syria to battle the Assad regime a ‘failure’ that led to jihadists such as the Islamic State (ISIS) moving in…  “Goldberg notes in his article that Clinton's separation from Obama was only a matter of time, and as she comes closer to announcing her own candidacy, she was notably more blunt in her interview with him…” “Clinton… ‘is basically a believer in the use of military force for humanitarian purposes and is less sensitive than President Obama is…’ says David C. Unger, the long-time member of the New York Times Editorial Board…  As Obama's previous secretary of state, Clinton had strongly argued for arming the Syrian opposition, but that argument lost out against a more cautious approach generally favored by Obama and others in the administration.” The Daily Beast wrote on August 11:\n\n \n\n “The argument that America should have done more in Syria, made for years by foreign policy leaders in both parties and several members of Obama’s senior national security team, was brought back to the fore this past weekend. Obama and Hillary Clinton gave dueling interviews in which they publicly split on whether the security and humanitarian catastrophe in Syria could have been avoided if the United States had played a larger role. Obama’s outburst on July 31, one week prior, reveals the criticism was already getting to him, even before the White House tried to deflect Clinton’s remarks as pre-presidential political posturing.\n\n \n\n “Just before the congressional recess, President Obama invited over a dozen Senate and House leaders from both parties to the White House to talk about foreign policy. According to two lawmakers inside the meeting, Obama became visibly agitated when confronted by bipartisan criticism of the White House’s policy of slow-rolling moderate Syrian rebels’ repeated requests for arms to fight the Assad regime and ISIS.\n\n \n\n “According to one of the lawmakers, Sen. Bob Corker asked the president a long question that included sharp criticisms of President Obama’s handling of a number of foreign policy issues—including Syria, ISIS, Russia, and Ukraine. Obama answered Corker at length… But days after the White House meeting, Corker wrote a blistering op-ed for The Washington Post criticizing Obama’s handling of foreign policy. ‘Today, after three years of bold rhetoric divorced from reality, 170,000 Syrians are dead, and we are not innocent bystanders. The president encouraged the opposition to swallow deadly risks, then left them mostly hanging,’ the senator wrote. ‘Extremist groups from Syria have surged into Iraq, seizing key territory and resources, and are threatening to completely undo the progress of years of U.S. sacrifice.’\n\n \n\n “Top Democratic lawmakers agreed with Corker and Clinton that doing more to support the moderate rebels would have at least had a chance of averting or mitigating the current crisis, which has now spread to large parts of Iraq as ISIS expands its newly declared Caliphate…\n\n \n\n “In a New York Times interview published Aug. 8, Obama said that the idea arming the rebels would have made a difference had ‘always been a fantasy.’ ‘This idea that we could provide some light arms or even more sophisticated arms to what was essentially an opposition made up of former doctors, farmers, pharmacists and so forth, and that they were going to be able to battle not only a well-armed state but also a well-armed state backed by Russia, backed by Iran, a battle-hardened Hezbollah, that was never in the cards,’ Obama said…\n\n \n\n “Not all lawmakers support arming the rebels; Sen. Rand Paul, for example, is on the record opposing the use of U.S. military resources to fight ISIS in Iraq or Syria. Also, Clinton and many lawmakers acknowledge that arming the rebels was risky and might not have worked. The weapons could’ve fallen into the extremists’ hands…”\n\n \n\n Arming rebels is indeed a very dangerous endeavor. Now, the discussion has shifted to arming the Kurds and others in Iraq to defend against ISIS, as previous articles discuss. However, today’s “friends” can very quickly become tomorrow’s enemies. Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein are prime examples. The Lawless United States�Always at War Somewhere The Huffington Post wrote on August 10:\n\n \n\n “Ukraine. Gaza. Syria. Yemen. Pakistan. If it feels like the United States is always at war somewhere, that's because it is. Not just Iraq and Afghanistan - the two wars we all know about.

It's our money, our weapons and - more often in recent weeks - our Secretary of State, engaged in high-stakes diplomacy to uneven results… investigative journalist Kevin Gosztola put the U.S. war count at 74. These are mostly unannounced and undeclared wars against enemies that have different aspirations, strategies and ideologies… \n\n \n\n “While the eyes of the American media and public might have shifted back to Iraq for now, just a week ago they were, momentarily, back on Afghanistan. In another example of how dangerous the country still is for our military, we heard about the killing of Major General Harold Greene, who was killed by an Afghan soldier in a green-on-blue gunfire exchange… Three in four Americans believe that history will judge the war in Afghanistan a failure… \n\n \n\n “What we are leaving behind is in fact… ‘more war, and more terror.’ What we're leaving behind in terms of our reputation is the idea of American lawlessness… Our lawlessness doesn't just hurt us abroad.

It's a bitter win, and not just for opponents of further Islamization… “The outcome was fully democratic and therefore irrefutable. That's one side of the coin. But on the other side is the fear that Turkey could now head further down the path of transformation into an Islamic republic - with increasing religious requirements for citizens in everyday life. “With Erdogan's victory, the secular reforms of Turkey's founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk fall further to pieces… Erdogan was chosen because he gave the Turkish people a whole new sense of self-esteem based on religious values… “Surrounded by ongoing crises in places like Iraq and Syria, and the conflicts in Gaza/Israel and Ukraine/Russia, not to mention the recently renewed fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, Erdogan must overcome fears that he will only add fuel to these fires. It's something he has often done in the past. The EU - and especially Germany - will have to cope with an increasingly uncomfortable relationship with Erdogan…” “Erdogan, 60, has been in power for 11 years, and because he can no longer serve as prime minister after three terms in office, he has now [been elected as] president… [He] has become more and more authoritarian with each election win. He has had protests quelled and critics arrested, and has gradually implemented Islamic moral values… “Istanbul law professor Bertan Tokuzlu believes that… [Erdogan] will transform Turkey into a one-man state, once and for all… Erdogan himself makes no secret of how he intends to govern in the future. In a television interview in late July, he announced his intention to introduce a presidential system, and he cited China and Russia as models…” Turkey will continue to play a very controversial role in the near future.

Many of the writers and reviewers of this publication once belonged to a different church organization. For the purpose of this Q&A, it does not matter whether or not you, as the reader, are familiar with that organization. Even if you have never heard of that organization, the following should still be very revealing. The organization referred to (the Worldwide Church of God under its human leader, Herbert W. Armstrong, who died  in 1986)  had taught the truth for decades. A few years after its founder died, the new leadership began to introduce doctrinal changes. The changes were subtly introduced, and it was claimed at the time that they were just clarifications or changes in terminology. Before explaining in detail what actually happened, let us examine the nation of Israel and the building of the first temple under King Solomon to extract historical lessons from  it.  When a nation or a church organization is pleasing God through faithful obedience, God blesses that nation or church. The first temple at Jerusalem was a most magnificent building. We can read about the Queen of Sheba, a person who was used to opulence and grandeur.  When she came to visit Solomon and viewed the temple, the servants and all that Solomon had done, she fainted. We read in 1 Kings 10:1-5 (in the Authorized Version): “And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions. And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not anything hid from the king, which he told her not. And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built, And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.” Yet in spite of all the gold, silver and costly things in the temple and in Jerusalem, the temple was subsequently completely destroyed. Why did God allow this?  After all, even the ark of the covenant was placed in this beautiful temple. We can read in the book of Ezra that at the time when the second temple was built, the people wept because they had seen the spendour of the first temple under Solomon,  and this second house did not remotely compare to it. Ezra 3:10-12 states (Authorized Version): “And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel. And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid. But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy…” Later, Jesus warned the disciples that the second temple, which had been greatly beautified by Herod, would also be destroyed. This occurred in 70 AD under Titus. God allowed the destruction of the first and second temples because of sinful conduct and behaviour. Sin, if not dealt with, is destructive to a nation, a church and an individual. The Worldwide Church of God’s Auditorium in Pasadena, California, was one of the nicest buildings in the US, with near perfect acoustics for anyone speaking from or singing on stage.  Important people lectured there and world-renown artists played and performed. There was an  inscription in gold letters on the wall of the entryway, stating in part: “DEDICATED TO THE GREAT GOD.” Yet today, the Auditorium and the entire College campus are no longer in the hands of Church members, and many of the buildings on campus have been torn down. So, what happened? The Worldwide Church of God has collapsed—even its name was changed, so technically, it does no longer exist; and the Church’s three Colleges (in Pasadena, Bricket Wood, England, and Big Sandy, Texas) are no longer operated by the Church. Let us realize how sinful doctrinal compromise and false teachings led to the entire downfall of the Worldwide Church of God organization. It all really started with a “new understanding” regarding the “Born Again” teaching. As we explain in our free booklet, “Are You Already Born Again?”, we are begotten when we receive the Holy Spirit, but not yet born. The Worldwide Church of God under Herbert Armstrong understood and taught this, but the new leadership after Mr. Armstrong’s death was very anxious to change this teaching and to proclaim that we are already born again when we receive God’s Spirit. Why were they determined to do this? Why was Satan’s first major attack on the doctrines of the Church directed towards that very teaching on “Born Again”? Satan is not stupid. His agenda is and was to be worshipped as god and to replace the one and true God as supreme Commander of the universe. Satan is also very subtle. He is an expert at deception and lying. The great commission to the Church of God is to preach and publish the gospel of the Kingdom of God to the world as a witness, and to feed the flock. At the very core of this gospel message is the knowledge and understanding about “born again” and the fact that God is reproducing Himself through mankind.  Man’s potential is to become a born-again immortal God being in the Family or Kingdom of God. In Satan’s eyes, the dismantling and changing of this understanding was crucial to bringing the church down, since that knowledge also includes the fact that as sons and daughters of God, we will replace Satan and the demons as the present rulers of this world. Corrupting this understanding was just like placing a virus in a computer. Corrupting it was crucial in Satan’s efforts to ultimately destroy the Worldwide Church of God. Christ is the Head of the Church of God, which is a spiritual organism. It operates through human organizations. If you think of a Church organization as a body, it stands on two legs.  The doctrine of “born again” was one leg which Satan wanted to cut off. The other leg which had to be cut off in Satan’s mind was the correct understanding about the nature of God--the knowledge that God is a Family, currently consisting of two Members. This knowledge is crucial to the gospel message, since it also helps us to understand our ultimate destiny. Slowly turning that correct understanding to the pagan and unbiblical doctrine of the Trinity in all its various forms was cutting the second leg from the body which caused the body to fall, and the Worldwide Church of God has never recovered from that fall. These two doctrines are crucial in order for us to stand as a Church, and they are also crucial for the gospel message to be properly understood. In order to spiritually survive today, we must never let go or compromise on those two doctrines. If we do, then the understanding of other doctrines will also be lost over a period of time. Changing true doctrines and teaching spiritual error is sin. The Worldwide Church of God organization with its many buildings and campuses was destroyed because of the sinful and misleading conduct and doctrinal error of its leadership, after Herbert Armstrong’s death, and the many ministers and members who accepted these false teachings. Let’s fully understand the destructiveness of sin regardless of the grandeur and spendour of Solomon’s temple; the temple in Jesus’ time; and the Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena. They were destroyed or polluted, and the Auditorium and the Pasadena campus of the Worldwide Church of God are now in the hands of Sunday-worshippers –all because of sin. That’s why it is so crucial not to compromise with doctrine but to stick to the trunk of the tree, and not to get side-tracked from the commission of the Church of preaching the true gospel which contains the only hope for mankind. In our free booklet, “Are You Already Born Again,” we describe in detail the doctrinal downfall of the Worldwide Church of God from its unique correct scriptural understanding to an appalling blasphemous apostasy: “When the change on ‘born again’ came, some noted that this would ultimately lead to a change regarding the nature of God and the potential of man. A few years later, those changes, anticipated by some, actually had taken place. How could anyone have foreseen this development? “Simply, because the correct ‘born again’ understanding goes hand in hand with other important Biblical concepts and teachings. When we understand that Christians—those who have received the Holy Spirit—are ‘begotten’ of the Father, we also understand that the Father is reproducing Himself through us. We understand that God is a Family, and that God wants to enlarge His Family through us. We also understand that Christ, the SON of God and the firstborn among many brethren, will marry His church at the time of His return (Revelation 19:7–9; Matthew 22:2; 25:10; Ephesians 5:31–32). “One important principle taught in the Bible is that a kind only reproduces according to its own kind… [This] shows that Christ will NOT marry a church that is physical. Christ is God—a Spirit being. Christ will only marry Spirit beings. We understand that we are not yet Spirit beings. We also understand, however, that we WILL BE Spirit beings at the time of our resurrection and change to immortality. THEN we WILL BE spirit. THEN we WILL BE born again. THEN Christ WILL marry us. And NOT BEFORE! “All of these Biblical concepts go together. After we are begotten of God’s Spirit, we have to grow in Christ’s knowledge. We have to become perfect (Matthew 5:48). The receipt of the Holy Spirit is just the BEGINNING of our journey toward perfection and ultimate entrance into the Kingdom of God. “We understand, too, that the Kingdom of God has not yet come. Christ has not yet established the Kingdom of God on earth. He will do so when He returns. At that time, we will be IN the Kingdom of God. Why? Because we WILL BE God—and God is a Kingdom—the Family of God RULING over creation… “Since Christ’s death made it possible that man can become God, and since Christ will rule as King of kings and Lord of lords in this Kingdom, under God the Father, the gospel message also includes information about Christ Himself. However, the gospel message goes beyond the person of Christ. It’s a message brought by Christ—not a message limited to the personage of Christ… “We understand that our ultimate salvation is still in the future—that we will be saved when we enter God’s Kingdom—at which time we will be God… “In time… we heard the terminology of a gospel about Christ, or that Christ was the gospel. At the same time, we were taught that the Kingdom, although still future to an extent, had already arrived, that we were already in the Kingdom, and that Christ would only come to ‘inaugurate’ the Kingdom. “We were also taught that we were already saved. All of these ‘new’ teachings were ‘logical’ extensions of the false understanding of ‘born again.’ IF we were already ‘born again,’ then we could see and enter the Kingdom. Therefore, so the reasoning went, since we ‘were already’ born again, we ‘were already’ in the Kingdom and already saved. Since we were already saved, we were gradually taught that we didn’t have to ‘grow’ anymore in Christ’s knowledge as how to keep the law, since the law was allegedly no longer in force and effect. No more Ten Commandments, let alone any commanded observance of God’s annual Holy Days, as Christ supposedly did away with them all! Christ’s statement that we cannot see the Kingdom was incorrectly interpreted… in a way that He was merely talking about ‘perceiving’ the powers of the Kingdom. Of course, these so-called new concepts also required a ‘re-definition’ of what the Bible says about the Kingdom of God. “Then, we were told that it is incorrect to say that God IS a Family—rather, we should say that God HAS a family. With that ‘subtle’ change, the truth of the nature of God began to become obscure. If God were not a Family, then God was not reproducing Himself, either. Again, we see the ‘logical’ consequence of the ‘born again’ change. This, then, led to the ultimate change regarding the nature of God. God was no longer perceived as consisting of two Beings (God the Father and God the Son), but as just ONE Being. Since God was no longer a Family, there was no longer a duality in the Godhead, either. Clear Scriptures proving the duality of the Godhead were re-interpreted, twisted, or simply ignored… “We were also taught that God, although one Person, represents Himself within a ‘threefold mode of being.’ A ‘clever’ argument was presented that a person can have three functions—that of a father, a husband, and a president. In other words, God was described as consisting of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, but these three ‘functions’ were not Persons, but ‘hypostases.’ This concept had been adopted from a Greek Orthodox idea that stemmed from pagan Greeks like Plato and Aristotle. It was then reasoned that Jesus Christ was a created being who did not exist prior to His human birth. So, we suddenly were introduced to God (one Person in three hypostases), and Christ (another—created—person), who was or somehow became a son, but separate and apart from the ‘Son’-hypostasis of the God-Person. We were even told that the Son was still in heaven (as one of the three hypostases), while Christ was here on earth, and that the Son remained alive when Christ, the physical person, died. With that idea, the supreme sacrifice of Christ had been denied and rejected. “To add further to the confusion and heresy, we were subsequently told, without any explanation, that God was a Trinity, the same concept taught by the Catholic Church and most Protestant churches—one Person in three Persons (no longer ‘hypostases,’ as previously represented). Christ had now become part of the Trinity, although it remained unclear what He was before He became man, what He was when He was here on earth, and what He became after His resurrection. God, in any event, had become a closed Trinity. Since He was no longer a Family, man could not become a part of that Family. It was taught that God would ‘adopt’ Christians, but Christians would never become God’s real sons and daughters. God was no longer reproducing Himself through man. It was taught that God was CREATING or building a somewhat figurative ‘family.’ However, God was no longer adding to the very Family that He is and that He always has been. Christians were no longer understood as becoming members of the very God Family, with God being their true and real Father, and Christ being their true and real elder Brother… “Without the ‘born again’ change, the subsequent changes could not have occurred. It is, therefore, imperative that we not tamper with the correct understanding of ‘born again.’ If we do, even in seemingly unimportant areas of ‘terminology’ or ‘explanations,’ we will change the proper understanding of what ‘born again’ means, and we will thereby open a floodgate of change, again. In the end, we might very well find ourselves being totally void of all correct Biblical understanding. It happened before to those who apparently understood the truth at one time. Let us not think that it could not happen again. ‘He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says…’ (Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22).” The Bible tells us that a falling away from the truth is still to occur in the Church of God, just prior to the return of Christ (2 Thessalonians 2:1-3). If history is our guide, then something very similar to the last apostasy in the Worldwide Church of God will happen again in God’s Church in the not-too-distant future. Even though we are clearly living today in the Laodicea era of the Church—which can be described as a big lukewarm social club without real zeal, being filled with riches, pride and self-deception (Revelation 3:14-18)—there are still remnants of some of the previous eras in existence today. One era is designated as Sardis, describing a church which has a name that it is living and alive, but it is spiritually dead, with works which are not perfect before God, and only very few in that church have not defiled their garments and are worthy to be given white clothes (Revelation 3:1). Another remnant is that of Philadelphia (Revelation 3:7-10), designating a faithful church with little strength, which keeps Christ’s Word and which does not deny His name. It stays faithful to the truth and refuses to compromise with doctrine. Only members with that Philadelphia spirit are promised protection from the terrible times to come.  It is they who will not fall for the errors of doctrinal deception, and only they will be spared from the clutches of the falling away from the truth which is still prophesied to happen. If you are in a church organization which has begun to compromise with the faith once delivered to the saints (Jude 3)—especially in the areas of “born again” and the gospel of the Kingdom or Family of God—then God tells you to come out of that spiritual Babylon of confusion (Revelation 18:4), and to refuse to partake of its sins of false teachings. If you have and embrace the truth, make sure that you continue to hold on to it, no matter what the circumstances and challenges may be.\n\nRecently my husband and I have had events in our lives where there was little down time. Family matters and visits, immediate and long term home repair attention, summer land/tree maintenance and other seemingly important responsibilities have been taking up a good chunk of our summer days. It seems like one day was just a continuing previous day without end! I started to ask myself lots of questions. When is the down time?   Do we have the right balance?   Did we overextend ourselves in family matters/visits and make the right decisions? Should we let some things go and in what order of importance should they be? Do we fully trust God that He will not give us more than we can bear? What lessons is He teaching me?  But the one thing I realized most is that there was no quiet time... no silence… no time to meditate and re-evaluate on these issues daily.  Not only to rest physically but also to rest spiritually.  My body and brain were on overload and needed space and time to breathe! Things needed to change - something was wrong! I needed to STOP and MAKE that time to meditate on the day’s activities in how I did spiritually and how to improve and meditate on my choices. Without that meditation time, I was just going from one day to the next without analyzing my actions against Godly principles and making the necessary, albeit difficult, changes that God requires of me.  What amazed me is how Satan can try and steal this very precious time! I had better appreciate how important silence and meditation really are, so that I can be a true beacon of light in this world and to be a help in God’s Kingdom to come. After all, it’s not all about the physical, but about the spiritual.  I look forward to God’s Kingdom of true peace, where there will be time for all to meditate on God’s Word. In this fast-paced Satan-inspired world, silence is not only golden--it is refining!",

has in some respects been a boon iraqi military forces­ rapidly withdrew from the north enabling the kurds to seize areas where they had disputed control with baghdad including the oilrich city of

central government withholding funds banning cargo flights and making it difficult for the kurds to replenish their arms its a big responsibility its a long border many of our troops are there and we dont know how long the situation will continue barzani said we are really overstretched relations with baghdad have soured as the kurds have pushed toward independence and have begun to sell crude oil

have seized weapons worth hundreds of millions of dollars from retreating iraqi soldiers this is the truth that the world should know he said so we are left out to fight all these terrorists all these

the best way to go is for the kurdish region to stay inside iraqs constitutional framework i think the heart of every kurd wants an independent state mcgurk told the house foreign affairs committee i

Pesh merga roughly translates as “those who face death.”\n\n“I feel it among my friends, but they wouldn’t even think about not defending their country,” he said.\n\n“We chose this way. We might die, but it’s a point of pride to shed blood for Kurdistan.”\n\nKaren DeYoung in Washington contributed to this report.",

If they're not the most effective terrorists in history, they may be the best since Genghis Khan and his Mongol hordes terrorized the world in the 13th century. Their practice of murdering people of minority religious sects is now well established, which has Shiites and others fleeing for their lives in northern Iraq. One such group is a small sect known as the Yazidi. Their stronghold in the north was overrun by ISIS which sent more than 150,000 of them fleeing. Now, about 40,000 - most of them women and children - are stranded on a rocky, mile high mountain with no food or water and no escape from ISIS.\n\nTens of thousands of members of one of Iraq's oldest minorities have been stranded on a mountain in the country's north-west, facing slaughter at the hands of jihadists surrounding them below if they flee, or death by dehydration if they stay. UN groups say at least 40,000 members of the Yazidi sect, many of them women and children, have taken refuge in nine locations on Mount Sinjar, a craggy, mile-high ridge identified in local legend as the final resting place of Noah's ark. At least 130,000 more people, many from the Yazidi stronghold of Sinjar, have fled to Dohuk, in the Kurdish north, or to Irbil, where regional authorities have been struggling since June to deal with one of the biggest and most rapid refugee movements in decades. Sinjar itself has been all but emptied of its 300,000 residents since jihadists stormed the city late on Saturday, but an estimated 25,000 people remain. \"We are being told to convert or to lose our heads,\" said Khuldoon Atyas, who has stayed behind to guard his family's crops. \"There is no one coming to help.\" Another man, who is hiding in the mountains and identified himself as Nafi'ee, said: \"Food is low, ammunition is low, and so is water. We have one piece of bread to share between 10 people. We have to walk 2km to get water. There were some air strikes yesterday [against the jihadists], but they have made no difference.\" At least 500 Yazidis, including 40 children, have been killed in the past week, local officials say. Many more have received direct threats, either from the advancing militants or members of nearby Sunni communities allied with them. \"They were our neighbours and now they are our killers,\" said Atyas. \"It's not like this is a one-off incident,\" said the Unicef spokeswoman Juliette Touma. \"We are almost back to square zero in terms of the preparedness and the supplies. Enormous numbers of people have been crossing the border since June. \"The stresses are enormous; dehydration, fatigue, people sometimes having to walk for days. The impact on kids is very physical, let alone the psychological impact.\"\n\nA former diplomat, the longest serving State Department employee in Iraq, paints a frightening picture of what's happening:\n\n\"Iraq is spiralling out of control,\" said Ali Khedery, the former longest-serving US official in Baghdad. \"The centrifugal forces are spinning so quickly. They are on one timeline and Washington is on another. I am beyond concerned.\" Khedery, who reported to five US ambassadors and three US central command generals and is now chairman of the Dubai-based consultancy Dragoman Partners, said: \"Everybody is retreating to their corners. And there is no credible international actor that I can see that is trying to bring it together again. \"It definitely is an existential threat to the Iraqi government and I think it represents yet another manifestation of the disintegration of Iraq as we know it. \"Iranian overreach, the genocide in Syria, [Nouri] al-Maliki's consolidation of power in a very sectarian way, have all led to the disillusionment, the disenfranchisement of the Sunni Arabs, who have fatally, but perhaps understandably, chosen to consummate a deal with the devil. Now we are locked in a race to the bottom.\"\n\n\"No credible actor\" includes the US which is nowhere to be found while Iraq disintegrates. We've got a few hundreds soldiers apparently training the Iraqi military, but beyond that - nothing. Wepeans are on the way but by the time they arrive, Iraq may be no more.\n\nBut with everything else going on in the world - Syria, Ukraine, Ebola, our southern border - the tragedy that is unfolding before our eyes in Iraq gets lost in the shuffle. A situation that cries out for American leadership isn't getting it because the American president doesn't want to risk getting drawn into the conflict.\n\nRisk is part of sitting in the big chair. But as with everything else these days, the president seems disengaged and helpless to do anything about the situation.\n\nA previous version of this article implied that the Yazidi are Muslim.

republicanamerican waterbury connecticut editorial taxpayers friend i n a state dominated by socialist politicians subservient to publicemployee unions what big labor says goes breaking labors stranglehold on taxpayers will not be easy but its a fight worth winning and taxpayers now have another important ally in that fight the bipartisan connecticut municipal consortium for fiscal responsibility the consortiums goal to fix the fundamental flaws of compulsory arbitration in publicemployeeunion contracts should be the no 1 priority of the connecticut conference of municipalities and its ilk unfortunately those organizations like the legislature and much of the executive branch have been hijacked by the unions and thus give only lip service to reforms when they are raised every spring at the capitol given the odds of success the fight for reform must go on 247 and those in the trenches must be tireless and relentless and thats where the consortium can play its most vital role the consortium is led by michael guarco chairman of granby s finance board who understands that fiscal responsibility will be impossible in connecticut as long as unelected arbiters wield their biased influence over the process and have the final say on whats reasonable and necessary mr guarco and just about every municipal and state official know arbitration forces governments to devote ever larger shares of their annual budgets to employee wages and benefits they know arbitration robs local governments of their ability to address local needs and priorities but the biggest difference is mr guarco is willing to take on the powerful special interests who enjoy putting the screws to helpless taxpayers the consortiums objective amend labor laws that protect unions while driving state and local taxes ever higher he and the consortium deserve the immediate and wholehearted support of municipal boards in greater waterbury the naugatuck valley and litchfield county but that backing must be more than just the adoption of a single strongly worded resolution members of boards of selectmen finance and education as well as town councilors and aldermen must be willing to put in the time to agitate for arbitration reform they must testify at legislative hearings speak to community groups and take every opportunity to raise the issue of arbitration reform at any public forum they must get behind candidates for local and state offices who share their view that the effects of binding arbitration may be seen in connecticuts deteriorated infrastructure in underfunded state and local pension funds in reduced municipal and state services in narrowed school curriculums and in the rampant corruption in state government those unwilling to make the commitment should step aside in favor of those who are willing as veterans of the arbitrationreform effort we know the consortium is in for a long hard frustrating fight it can not expect help from big labors lackeys in the legislature or from a news media reflexively sympathetic to union causes in the face of determined resistance from the entrenched special interests the consortium and its allies must not waver only when taxpayers or people accountable directly to them have the final say on union contracts will governments be able to control their fiscal destiny and taxpayers secure genuine tax relief voicesnewscom by leda quirke oxford theres strength in numbers especially when it comes to effecting reforms for the economic betterment of the community that was the message imparted by mike guarco a spokesman for the connecticut municipal consortium for fiscal responsibility to representatives of boards of finance education and selectmen from the towns of oxford woodbury naugatuck new milford and monroe mr guarco who also is chairman of granbys board of finance was invited to oxford town hall last thursday evening by the local finance board to provide information about the consortium which was founded in december and now has representation from 60 of the states 169 towns and from 75 municipal boards the consortiums mission mr guarco said is to encourage local officials and their advocacy groups to communicate and work together for common objectives to educate the legislature about common problems and to lobby for legislative changes that permit communities to live within their means without negatively impacting services and taxes issues the consortium has identified as needing reform include the lack of local control over expenditures such as salaries and benefits and the cumulative impact of unfunded mandates the consortium was created in response to growing dissatisfaction among taxpayers which has been evidenced over the last few years by the budget defeats in a growing number of towns mr guarco said its agenda which is similar to those of three major municipal advocacy groups the connecticut council of municipalities the council of small towns and the connecticut association of boards of education is to level the playing field under binding arbitration raise cost thresholds on capital projects under prevailing wage laws and prohibit new mandates until state government meets its existing funding commitments to towns under current law mr guarco noted that town budgets which through the 1990s increased 2 to 3 percent annually have in the last three or four years reflected increases of 4 to 45 percent at the same time unemployment is increasing and the level of service is declining in many towns we see program after program falling from the budget with money going to pay for salaries and new mandates he said mr guarco said the consortium whose membership is concentrated now in the hartford and litchfield areas is seeking to add to its roster representatives from the boards of selectmen education and finance from more towns if cost control is important in your community this is a way to pursue it he told attendees asked by local board of finance chairman tom kelly how the consortium would use local support mr guarco responded that a grass roots effort was needed to reach legislators the folks at cabe cost and ccm which are part and parcel of this development need grass roots to weigh in he said he said a few members probably cant be effective but a consortium of 100 towns with 70 or more members can make a difference when the boards of selectmen finance and education deliver the same message the effect is even more dramatic he suggested oxford finance board member dick burke who learned about the consortium in a newspaper article and who persuaded the finance board to invite mr guarco to a meeting suggested that the consortium needed to make communities aware of their existence and their mission if i hadnt read the article none of us would be sitting here tonight he said mr burke suggested that newsletter mailings might be one way to make get other communities on board asked how communities could join mr guarco said all that was necessary was to have town boards adopt a resolution endorsing the consortiums mission statement mr burke said after the meeting that he hoped that the consortium grows this grass roots effort has to become more structured to keep it together he said selectman dave haversat and board of education chairman robert debisschop said they would take the proposal to their respective boards for their endorsement mr debisscchop said he believed the consortium had significant merit the bigger we make that group the better off the local board will be he said mr debisschop said he agreed that the issues of binding arbitration and unfunded state mandates needed to be addressed in short theyre killing us he said",

            "text": "The genesis of the Consortium – a broad alliance of duly elected town boards from a host of municipalities throughout Connecticut – comes in response to the growing wave of taxpayer discontent and local budget defeats we have witnessed over the past couple of years. The rate of rejections remains high while local property tax rates increase at around 5% per year. At the same time, overall municipal employment declines and existing program is squeezed out of budgets in town after town, victims of unbridled compensation and other state interventions into our local budgetary affairs.\n\nOur focus is primarily on the cost-management side of the equation.  Our mission is to press for return to the local level of a greater ability to manage key elements in our own municipal budgets.\n\nThe platform planks are all common threads of the legislative agendas of the three major municipal advocacy organizations – CCM, COST, and CABE – and call for leveling the playing field under binding arbitration, raising the cost thresholds on capital projects under prevailing wage laws, and prohibiting new mandates placed on  towns until state government meets its own existing funding commitments to the towns under current law.

none of them realized how urgent it had become to leave skip to next paragraph tyler hicksthe new york times of 58 firefighters who escaped the north tower and eventually gave oral histories only four said they had known of the south towers collapse they had no idea that less than 200 feet away the south tower had already collapsed in a lifecrushing earthshaking heap nor did the firefighters know that their commanders on the street and police helicopter pilots in the sky were warning that the north tower was on the edge of the same fate until last month the extent of their isolation from critical information in the final 29 minutes had officially been a secret for three and a half years mayor michael r bloomberg refused to release the fire departments oral histories of sept 11 2001 under court order however 12000 pages were made public in august on close review those accounts give a bleaker version of events than either mayor bloomberg or former mayor rudolph w giuliani presented to the 911 commission both had said that many of the firefighters who perished in the north tower realized the terrible danger of the moment but chose to stay in the building to rescue civilians they made no mention of what one oral history after another starkly relates that firefighters in the building said they were clueless and knew absolutely nothing about the reality of the gathering crisis in stairwells or resting on floors they could not see what had happened or hear clearly stated warnings even after the south tower fell when few civilians remained in the lower floors of the north tower throngs of firefighters lingered in the lobby and near the 19th floor as time ran down the survivors said thats the hard thing about it knowing that there were so many other people still left in that lobby that could have got out firefighter hugh mettham of ladder company 18 said although no official summary specifies where the 343 firefighters died in the rescue effort a review by the new york times of eyewitness accounts dispatch records and federal reports suggests that about 200 perished in the north tower or at its foot of 58 firefighters who escaped the building and gave oral histories only four said they knew the south tower had already fallen just three said they had heard radio warnings that the north tower was also in danger of collapse and some who had heard orders to evacuate debated whether they were meant for civilians or firefighters not in my wildest dream not in my wildest dream did i think those towers were coming down said david sandvik of ladder 110 the point made by both mr giuliani and mr bloomberg to the 911 commission that firefighters died because they delayed their own departures while trying to save the lives of civilians and other firefighters is in one sense fully corroborated by the oral histories even so measured against the waves of details in those accounts those valiant lastminute efforts explain just a fraction of the firefighter deaths in the north tower a small vivid thread running through the broader fabric of the day no one in the fire department has tried to use the oral histories to reconstruct the events that led to its human losses that day although more than 500 interviews were conducted just about 10 percent of them involved people who had been inside the north tower no firefighters in the south tower which fell first are known to have survived its collapse many who escaped from the north tower did not give histories few followup questions were asked of those who did the ragged character of the records does not yield a clear explanation for the isolation of the rescuers within the building and whether it was because of radio failure a loss of command and control or flaws in the fire departments management structure some firefighters described receiving a radio message to evacuate others used strong language to characterize the communications gear as useless despite their spottiness the oral histories fill out incomplete chapters in the sprawling chronicle of what happened in new york that morning much of which took place far beyond the sight of television cameras and their global audience firefighters wondered aloud how they could have attacked a fire reached at the end of a fourhour climb they marveled at the decency of office workers coming down the stairs at the bellowing dustcoated chief on the sidewalk who herded the firefighters clear of the collapse zone at the voices of experience that brooked no hesitation the final moments of the departments senior leaders also rise from the histories as a struggle to rescue dozens of firefighters trapped in the marriott hotel after the south towers collapse as they worked the north tower crashed down killing among others chief of department peter ganci first deputy commissioner william feehan and battalion chiefs ray downey and lawrence stack precisely 29 minutes earlier at 959 am the fall of the south tower shook the north tower and stopped the slow muscular tide of rescuers by then the north tower firefighters had been on the move for more than an hour each carrying about 100 pounds of gear only a few had climbed much higher than the 30th floor some recalled hearing radio messages from individual firefighters who had made it as far as the 40s the calamity next door the collapse of one of the biggest buildings in the world was heard but not seen felt but not understood the staircases had no windows radio communication was erratic few firefighters even knew a second plane had struck the other building from the street chief ganci twice ordered firefighters to evacuate the north tower according to chief albert turi but it was not clear who inside if anyone heard him even chief turi standing a few feet away said it had not come over his radio still many decided to leave after hearing a rumor of a partial collapse some floors above them or because they assumed another plane had hit on the 37th floor daniel sterling of engine company 24 had stopped with firefighters from ladder 5 and engine 33 who did not survive when the building rattled a moment later firefighter sterling said chief john paolillo appeared he thought there was a partial collapse of the 65th floor of our building and that we should drop everything and leave firefighter sterling said get up and go go go a few floors below around the 30th or 31st floor chief paolillo was spotted again he was yelling leave your equipment and just get up and go go go like that lt brian becker of engine 28 said chief paolillo died the word to leave was passed to the 27th floor where many firefighters were resting including michael wernick of ladder 9 i know that there was no urgency at that point trying to get out of the building he said do you think anyone around you was aware that the other building collapsed an interviewer asked no he replied one exception was firefighter john drumm with engine 39 who said that on the 22nd floor he heard a transmission imminent collapse of the north tower immediate evacuation then he made a point repeated in nearly every interview from what i saw on the way down very very few civilians were left firefighter sterling said there was nobody in the staircase on the way down lieutenant becker said there were no civilians to speak of in our stairway there were a couple of stragglers being helped by somebody or other probationary firefighter robert byrne of engine 24 working his first fire reached the 37th floor i remember going up the stairs took us over the hour he said getting down the stairs took maybe 10 minutes not even also on 37 capt john fischer of ladder 20 discovered that two of his company had gone up ahead he was screaming at them for them to get back down said lt gregg hansson of engine 24 who was with captain fischer then he went up to get them captain fischer and his men died in the collapse firefighter william green of engine 6 was one of the few who said he knew the other tower had fallen on the 37th floor someone opened the door from the 36th floor and said two world trade center just fell down he said over the radio he heard mayday evacuate slowed by firefighters entering the staircase below him he switched sides in hindsight i think thats what saved my life he said he did not dawdle around the fourth floor i passed this civilian he might have been 450 pounds firefighter green said he was taking baby steps like this i walked right past him like all the other firemen i felt like a heel when im walking past him and im thinking to myself what does this guy think of me yet other chronicles show that a very heavy man in that location was eventually dragged to safety by rescuers who included firefighter pat kelly of rescue 18 having helped move the man outside firefighter kelly was the only member of his squad to survive he did not give an oral history elsewhere crowds of firefighters lingered lt william walsh of ladder 1 said he heard a mayday to evacuate when he was around the 19th floor but did not know that a plane had struck the other building much less that it had collapsed as he descended he saw firefighters who were not moving no rush to get out they were hanging out in the stairwell and in the occupancy and they were resting lieutenant walsh said i told them didnt you hear the mayday get out they were saying yeah well be right with you lou they just didnt give it a second thought they just continued with their rest three court officers reported seeing as many as 100 firefighters resting on the 19th floor minutes before the building fell but they were not questioned by the fire department mayor bloomberg in a letter to the 911 commission wrote we know for a fact that many firefighters continued their rescue work despite hearing maydays and evacuation orders and knowing the south tower had fallen asked to reconcile this statement with the oral histories the city law department cited the accounts of eight firefighters and said that each of them surely had spread the word about the collapse of the other tower in fact in six of those oral histories the firefighters specifically said they did not know the other building had fallen in the lobby just yards from safety survivors said that uncertainty doomed many firefighters john moribito of ladder 10 said there were maybe 40 or 50 members that were standing fast in the lobby roy chelsen of engine 28 said there were probably 20 or 30 guys down in the lobby mulling around the interviewer asked they werent trying to get out they were just no no firefighter chelsen recalled his officer lieutenant becker said there was chaos in the lobby it was random people running around there was no structure there were no crowds there was no no operation of any kind going on nothing there was no evacuation firefighters with ladder 11 and engine 4 came down together to the lobby but not all made it out everyone is standing there waiting to hear whats going to happen next whats going on frank campagna of ladder 11 said his company left and a moment later it came down on top of us firefighter campagna said four engine obviously didnt make it out they were with us the whole time so im assuming they were still in the lobby at that time the firefighters of ladder 9 lingered briefly and most were clear of the building for less than a minute when it fell firefighter wernick remembered seeing two members of his company in the lobby jeffrey walz and gerard baptiste they did not escape the funeral for firefighter baptiste whose remains were identified this year was held on wednesday a figure coated in dust over and over firefighters who had left the building in those final minutes bewildered by the sudden retreat the ruined lobby the nearempty street mentioned a chief covered in the dust of the first collapse standing just outside the north tower on west street some knew his name deputy assistant chief albert turi he was screaming just keep moving dont stop firefighter thomas orlando of engine 65 recalled adding i still didnt know the south tower collapsed chief turi he said saved an awful lot of people the chief has since retired in blunt speech free of the mythic glaze that varnished much 911 discourse some firefighters wondered why an endless line of rescuers had been sent to an unquenchable fire that raged 1000 feet up i think if this building had collapsed an hour later we would have had a thousand firemen in there said firefighter timothy marmion of engine 16 who carried a woman on a stretcher from the staircase to an ambulance if it would have collapsed three hours later he said we would have had 10000 firemen in those buildings had the buildings not fallen the gearladen firefighters would have needed about four hours almost as long as it takes to fly across the country to reach workers trapped on the high floors we were just as much victims as everybody that was in the building firefighter derek brogan of engine 5 said we didnt have a chance to do anything he added we didnt have a chance to put the fire out which was really all we were trying to do

Even after the south tower fell, when few civilians remained in the lower floors of the north tower, throngs of firefighters lingered in the lobby and near the 19th floor as time ran down, the survivors said.\n\n\"That's the hard thing about it, knowing that there were so many other people still left in that lobby that could have got out,\" Firefighter Hugh Mettham of Ladder Company 18 said.\n\nAlthough no official summary specifies where the 343 firefighters died in the rescue effort, a review by The New York Times of eyewitness accounts, dispatch records and federal reports suggests that about 200 perished in the north tower or at its foot.\n\nOf 58 firefighters who escaped the building and gave oral histories, only four said they knew the south tower had already fallen. Just three said they had heard radio warnings that the north tower was also in danger of collapse. And some who had heard orders to evacuate debated whether they were meant for civilians or firefighters.\n\n'Not in My Wildest Dream'\n\n\"Not in my wildest dream did I think those towers were coming down,\" said David Sandvik of Ladder 110.\n\nThe point made by both Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Bloomberg to the 9/11 Commission - that firefighters died because they delayed their own departures while trying to save the lives of civilians and other firefighters - is, in one sense, fully corroborated by the oral histories.\n\nEven so, measured against the waves of details in those accounts, those valiant last-minute efforts explain just a fraction of the firefighter deaths in the north tower, a small vivid thread running through the broader fabric of the day.\n\nNo one in the Fire Department has tried to use the oral histories to reconstruct the events that led to its human losses that day. Although more than 500 interviews were conducted, just about 10 percent of them involved people who had been inside the north tower. (No firefighters in the south tower, which fell first, are known to have survived its collapse.) Many who escaped from the north tower did not give histories. Few follow-up questions were asked of those who did.\n\nThe ragged character of the records does not yield a clear explanation for the isolation of the rescuers within the building, and whether it was because of radio failure, a loss of command and control or flaws in the Fire Department's management structure. Some firefighters described receiving a radio message to evacuate; others used strong language to characterize the communications gear as useless.\n\nDespite their spottiness, the oral histories fill out incomplete chapters in the sprawling chronicle of what happened in New York that morning, much of which took place far beyond the sight of television cameras and their global audience.\n\nFirefighters wondered aloud how they could have attacked a fire reached at the end of a four-hour climb. They marveled at the decency of office workers coming down the stairs, at the bellowing, dust-coated chief on the sidewalk who herded the firefighters clear of the collapse zone, at the voices of experience that brooked no hesitation.\n\nThe final moments of the department's senior leaders also rise from the histories as a struggle to rescue dozens of firefighters trapped in the Marriott Hotel after the south tower's collapse. As they worked, the north tower crashed down, killing, among others, Chief of Department Peter Ganci, First Deputy Commissioner William Feehan, and Battalion Chiefs Ray Downey and Lawrence Stack.\n\nPrecisely 29 minutes earlier, at 9:59 a.m., the fall of the south tower shook the north tower and stopped the slow, muscular tide of rescuers. By then, the north tower firefighters had been on the move for more than an hour. Each carrying about 100 pounds of gear, only a few had climbed much higher than the 30th floor. Some recalled hearing radio messages from individual firefighters who had made it as far as the 40's.\n\nThe calamity next door - the collapse of one of the biggest buildings in the world - was heard but not seen; felt but not understood. The staircases had no windows. Radio communication was erratic. Few firefighters even knew a second plane had struck the other building.\n\nFrom the street, Chief Ganci twice ordered firefighters to evacuate the north tower, according to Chief Albert Turi, but it was not clear who inside, if anyone, heard him. Even Chief Turi, standing a few feet away, said it had not come over his radio.\n\nStill, many decided to leave after hearing a rumor of a partial collapse some floors above them, or because they assumed another plane had hit.\n\nOn the 37th floor, Daniel Sterling, of Engine Company 24, had stopped with firefighters from Ladder 5 and Engine 33 - who did not survive - when the building rattled. A moment later, Firefighter Sterling said, Chief John Paolillo appeared.\n\n\"He thought there was a partial collapse of the 65th floor of our building and that we should drop everything and leave,\" Firefighter Sterling said.\n\n'Get Up and Go, Go, Go'\n\nA few floors below, around the 30th or 31st floor, Chief Paolillo was spotted again. \"He was yelling, 'Leave your equipment and just get up and go, go, go,' like that,\" Lt. Brian Becker of Engine 28 said. Chief Paolillo died.\n\nThe word to leave was passed to the 27th floor, where many firefighters were resting, including Michael Wernick of Ladder 9. \"I know that there was no urgency at that point trying to get out of the building,\" he said.\n\n\"Do you think anyone around you was aware that the other building collapsed?\" an interviewer asked.\n\nOne exception was Firefighter John Drumm with Engine 39, who said that on the 22nd floor, he heard a transmission: \"Imminent collapse of the north tower. Immediate evacuation.\"\n\nThen he made a point repeated in nearly every interview: \"From what I saw on the way down, very, very few civilians were left.\"\n\nFirefighter Sterling said, \"There was nobody in the staircase on the way down.\"\n\nLieutenant Becker said, \"There were no civilians to speak of in our stairway. There were a couple of stragglers being helped by somebody or other.\"\n\nProbationary Firefighter Robert Byrne of Engine 24, working his first fire, reached the 37th floor. \"I remember going up the stairs took us over the hour,\" he said. \"Getting down the stairs took maybe 10 minutes, not even.\"\n\nAlso on 37, Capt. John Fischer of Ladder 20 discovered that two of his company had gone up ahead. \"He was screaming at them for them to get back down,\" said Lt. Gregg Hansson of Engine 24, who was with Captain Fischer. \"Then he went up to get them.\" Captain Fischer and his men died in the collapse.\n\nFirefighter William Green of Engine 6 was one of the few who said he knew the other tower had fallen. On the 37th floor, \"someone opened the door from the 36th floor and said Two World Trade Center just fell down,\" he said. Over the radio, he heard \"Mayday, evacuate.\"\n\nSlowed by firefighters entering the staircase below him, he switched sides. \"In hindsight, I think that's what saved my life,\" he said.\n\nHe did not dawdle. \"Around the fourth floor, I passed this civilian - he might have been 450 pounds,\" Firefighter Green said. \"He was taking baby steps like this. I walked right past him like all the other firemen. I felt like a heel when I'm walking past him, and I'm thinking to myself, what does this guy think of me?\"\n\nYet other chronicles show that a very heavy man in that location was eventually dragged to safety by rescuers who included Firefighter Pat Kelly of Rescue 18. Having helped move the man outside, Firefighter Kelly was the only member of his squad to survive. He did not give an oral history.\n\nLt. William Walsh of Ladder 1 said he heard a Mayday to evacuate when he was around the 19th floor, but did not know that a plane had struck the other building, much less that it had collapsed. As he descended, he saw firefighters who were not moving.\n\nNo Rush to Get Out\n\n\"They were hanging out in the stairwell and in the occupancy and they were resting,\" Lieutenant Walsh said. \"I told them, 'Didn't you hear the Mayday? Get out.' They were saying, 'Yeah, we'll be right with you, Lou.' They just didn't give it a second thought. They just continued with their rest.\"\n\nThree court officers reported seeing as many as 100 firefighters resting on the 19th floor minutes before the building fell, but they were not questioned by the Fire Department.\n\nMayor Bloomberg, in a letter to the 9/11 Commission, wrote: \"We know for a fact that many firefighters continued their rescue work despite hearing Maydays and evacuation orders and knowing the south tower had fallen.\"\n\nAsked to reconcile this statement with the oral histories, the city Law Department cited the accounts of eight firefighters and said that each of them surely had spread the word about the collapse of the other tower. In fact, in six of those oral histories, the firefighters specifically said they did not know the other building had fallen.\n\nIn the lobby, just yards from safety, survivors said that uncertainty doomed many firefighters.\n\nJohn Moribito of Ladder 10 said there were maybe \"40 or 50 members that were standing fast in the lobby.\" Roy Chelsen of Engine 28 said, \"There were probably 20 or 30 guys down in the lobby mulling around.\" The interviewer asked, \"They weren't trying to get out?\"\n\n\"They were just - no, no,\" Firefighter Chelsen recalled.\n\nHis officer, Lieutenant Becker said, \"There was chaos in the lobby. It was random people running around. There was no structure. There were no crowds. There was no - no operation of any kind going on, nothing. There was no evacuation.\"\n\nFirefighters with Ladder 11 and Engine 4 came down together to the lobby, but not all made it out. \"Everyone is standing there, waiting to hear what's going to happen next, what's going on,\" Frank Campagna of Ladder 11 said.\n\nHis company left, and a moment later, \"it came down on top of us,\" Firefighter Campagna said. \"Four Engine obviously didn't make it out. They were with us the whole time, so I'm assuming they were still in the lobby at that time.\"\n\nThe firefighters of Ladder 9 lingered briefly, and most were clear of the building for less than a minute when it fell. Firefighter Wernick remembered seeing two members of his company in the lobby, Jeffrey Walz and Gerard Baptiste. They did not escape. The funeral for Firefighter Baptiste, whose remains were identified this year, was held on Wednesday.\n\nOver and over, firefighters who had left the building in those final minutes, bewildered by the sudden retreat, the ruined lobby, the near-empty street, mentioned a chief covered in the dust of the first collapse, standing just outside the north tower on West Street.\n\nSome knew his name: Deputy Assistant Chief Albert Turi.\n\n\"He was screaming, 'Just keep moving. Don't stop,' \" Firefighter Thomas Orlando of Engine 65 recalled, adding, \"I still didn't know the south tower collapsed.\" Chief Turi, he said, \"saved an awful lot of people.\" The chief has since retired.\n\nIn blunt speech, free of the mythic glaze that varnished much 9/11 discourse, some firefighters wondered why an endless line of rescuers had been sent to an unquenchable fire that raged 1,000 feet up.\n\n\"I think if this building had collapsed an hour later, we would have had a thousand firemen in there,\" said Firefighter Timothy Marmion of Engine 16, who carried a woman on a stretcher from the staircase to an ambulance.\n\n\"If it would have collapsed three hours later,\" he said, \"we would have had 10,000 firemen in those buildings.\"\n\nHad the buildings not fallen, the gear-laden firefighters would have needed about four hours - almost as long as it takes to fly across the country - to reach workers trapped on the high floors.\n\n\"We were just as much victims as everybody that was in the building,\" Firefighter Derek Brogan of Engine 5 said.\n\n\"We didn't have a chance to do anything,\" he added. \"We didn't have a chance to put the fire out, which was really all we were trying to do.\"",

Kuntz and Christoph ReuterSpiegel Oline InternationalAugust 11, 2014With the exception of a few birds defying the sweltering midday heat, all is quiet on the front, with Kurdish fighters cowering in the shade of the cliffs.  Suddenly, sentence fragments from Friday prayers can be heard on the banks of the Euphrates River.  \"Gather together . . . smash the traitors of the faith!\"  The words from the preacher, distorted by the amplifiers so loved by the jihadists, sound almost spooky.Down along the river, the jihadists with the Islamic State (IS) gather together for the next attack.  A few hundred meters above on the sparse, sun-drenched hills, the Kurds are sitting, feeling like they've somehow ended up on the set of a horror film.\"What do they want from us,\" asks one young fighter who only a few weeks ago still worked as a cashier in a supermarket.  \"These madmen keep on attacking and they continue to come at us even after they've been shot.  I hit one of them twice.  He only stopped after he was shot in the head.  They're insane.  They come here to die.\"Kobanê, known as Ayn al-Arab in Arabic, is a small Kurdish enclave in northern Syria located on the border with Turkey.  Since January it has been under siege by I.S. because Kobanê is located directly in the middle of the terrorist militia's self-declared caliphate.  Throughout the entire month of July, every three to four days, up to a thousand militiamen armed with tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and mortars would attack Kurds entrenched in the hills.  The only reason they have been able to withstand the onslaught is that they began digging protective trenches and building bunkers with cement ceilings earlier this year.  The front lines here today evoke those of World War I.But at the beginning of August, following the deaths of around 100 fighters on the Kurdish side and 500 on that of the I.S., this front in northern Syria suddenly grew quiet.  Strangely quiet, the besieged locals felt -- before realizing that the main jihadist force had moved around 300 Kilometers (186 miles) to the east into northern Iraq.After a long period of relative quiet, the I.S. fighters then surprised residents with a major offensive.  Within just days, they had overrun Iraqi cities that had been protected by Kurdish peshmerga fighters.  First they took the city of Sinjar, located west of Mosul near the Syrian border.  Then they took the Christian city of Qaraqosh and Bartella near Mosul.  By Friday, some of the fighters were within 30 kilometers of Erbil, the capital of the Iraqi Kurdistan region.For the international community, the swiftness with which the peshmerga were forced to retreat came unexpectedly, as did the mass exodus triggered by the I.S. fighters.  Over 100,000 people tried to flee to safety last week.The rapid advance compelled the United States, eleven years after the start of the Iraq war and almost three years after the official withdrawal of troops, once again to intervene militarily over the weekend.  F/A-18 fighter jets and drones conducted targeted air strikes in northern Iraq, using laser-guided bombs against mobile artillery used by the Islamic State in order to halt the fighters' advance on Erbil.  Secretary of State John Kerry accused the Islamists of \"targeted acts of violence\" that \"bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide\" and must be prevented.  Following the dramatic news and photos of the fleeing Yazidis and Christians, the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the developments.I.S. fighters had already arrived in Sinjar a week ago Sunday.  The city is the stronghold in Iraq for Yazidis, an ancient, pre-Muslim religious community, with roots in Zoroastrianism, whose members worship seven angels, including a peacock angel, in addition to god.  Radical Muslims have persecuted them as \"devil worshippers.\"Kurdish troops defended the city for several hours before running out of ammunition.  Reports that I.S. fighters had killed hundreds, or even more than a thousand, of Yazidis could not be confirmed.  But fear is widespread, the consequence of barbaric photos and videos posted by the Islamic State in the Internet, some showing shot or beheaded victims.  They are turning their reputation for cruelty into a weapon.Residents fled in long columns of vehicles to the Kurdish cities of Dohuk and Erbil, located around 200 kilometers to the east.  But not all made it out.  Those without vehicles or who waited too long to make their escape made it as far as the nearby mountains, arid crags devoid of food and water.Last week, thousands were holding out there, besieged by the jihadists.  \"There are 700 families here and the first six people have already died of thirst,\" Khoder Darwish Suliman, the father of a fleeing Yazidi family said by mobile phone, describing the situation.  \"Three were children. There is no water here, nothing to eat, absolutely nothing.\"  He said people were too afraid to return to their homes.  \"They're killing us,\" he said.  On Friday, aircraft from the U.S. and elsewhere began dropping humanitarian aid supplies over the mountains as the Iraqi air force had previously done.  By then, Suliman could no longer be reached by phone.The situation in Qaraqosh, a Christian city located 30 kilometers from Mosul, has also changed dramatically in the past week.  Some 40,000 Christians lived in the city, which is home to 12 churches and a mosque.  In June, a SPIEGEL reporter traveled to Qaraqosh and told the story of Salam Kihkhwa, a 31-year-old Catholic.  The small house at the entrance to the city where he lived with his parents now stands empty.  The family fled at 8:00 p.m. last Thursday.  It was the moment at which the jihadists finally occupied Qaraqosh.In the days prior, Salam had been posting horror stories on Facebook from nearby towns, sent to him by friends.  And the I.S. had also been intimidating Qaraqosh residents, cutting off electricity and water supplies.  \"I don't want to become a refugee and have to live in another country for years,\" he wrote.  He added that he and his family had wanted to remain in their hometown for as long as possible.On Friday morning, Salam told his own story be phone from Erbil.  His voice was shaky from exhaustion and lack of sleep.  He said that on Friday, a shell struck near his house, Salam saw dust rise, heard people scream and could then see them running away.  \"We heard heavy fighting the

As the first Kurdish fighters began to retreat in resignation that evening, people began leaving their homes.  Salam and his parents also squeezed into a car together with their neighbors.  Tens of thousands fled Qaraqosh.  It would take them several hours to make the 30-kilometer trip to Erbil.Salam is now living together with seven other families at his cousin's place in the Kurdish capital.  He says that many Iraqi Christians have now been left homeless.  He has since spoken to acquaintances who hid in Qaraqosh's only mosque.  I.S. militants, they said, have raised the black flag in the city and ordered all remaining Christians to leave.  \"Flight or death is the only choice we have,\" Salam says.On Friday, the British government advised its citizens to leave Erbil because of the advance of the I.S. and due to concern that the peshmerga would soon run out of ammunition.  As early as June, the Kurdish fighters had been ordered only to fire at nearby attackers because of the

ways to evacuate those trapped in the mountains outside Qaraqosh.Initially, the I.S. attacks in June provided the Kurds with the opportunity to take areas that they viewed to be Kurdish.  Now, though, it means they have a front line with the jihadists that is almost 1,000 kilometers long.  In an interview with the *Washington Post* at the end of July, Masrour Barzani, the Kurdistan Regional Government's intelligence and security chief, said the Kurds had asked the U.S. for assistance but had gotten \"not a single bullet.  This is the truth that the world should know.  So we are left out to fight all these terrorists, all these problems on our own.\"U.S. air strikes on I.S. positions over the weekend and into Monday -- along with the weapons deliveries indicate that is now changing.  But the I.S. \"caliphate,\" which it declared at the end of June, now stretches from the steppe between Marea and Al-Bab in northwestern Syria to an around 100 kilometers outside of Baghdad.  Almost the entire border between the two countries is under the control of the IS.And while the I.S. may be reminiscent of al-Qaida and earlier jihadist groups in terms of its propaganda, there is a significant difference.  The I.S. acts strategically and with a clear goal:  to bring as much land, money, people, weapons, and infrastructure as possible under its control.The radicals have profited from the months-long stalemate among various political factions in Iraq.  It has been made worse by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's unwillingness to step down, despite a parliamentary majority demand that he do so.  That has hindered the creation of a new government in Baghdad.  With a sectarian agenda backed by Iran aimed at bringing the country under Shiite control, Al-Maliki has incensed both Sunni Arabs and Kurds in the north of the country.  On Monday, Maliki even deployed elite security forces in Baghdad, underscoring his demands that the country's new president name him to form a new government.The I.S. advance would hardly be possible without support from Iraqi Sunnis.  Indeed, former U.S. advisor Ali Khedery says the disillusioned Sunnis have \"chosen to consummate a deal with the devil.\"  I.S. commandos, after all, haven't been picky about who they attack.  In Mosul, former military officers and Baath Party bigwigs from the era of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, have been arrested or have disappeared without a trace.  In Tikrit, leaders of aligned Sunni Islamists like the Naqshbandi Army have been intimidated or murdered.U.S. President Barack Obama had been eager to avoid intervention in Iraq absent a new government in Baghdad.  But the American air strikes on I.S. positions still won't solve the fundamental conflicts in these two countries -- conflicts that paved the way for the meteoric rise of the I.S. in the first place.For some time now, the lack of strong governments in Iraq and Syria has allowed the I.S. to operate freely in large swaths of the region.  The world, this week, is watching.  But it continues to ignore what is happening in northern Syria.  The I.S. is continuing its seige of Kobanê and the Turks have sealed the border to Kurds attempting to flee.  At the same time, Turkish officials are doing hardly anything to hinder jihadists who travel in and out of Turkish airports as they make their way into the region.",

promoting cleanenergy technologies in the bay state has released a study that found no significant effect of wind turbines on home values what we wanted to do was to help provide independent research to communities that are either dealing with questions about existing projects in their communities or communities that might be dealing with new projects said alicia barton ceo of the massachusetts clean energy center which sponsored the study more information on the study go to massceccomtechnologywindenergy a webinar with the studys authors is scheduled for 1230 pm jan 22 for more information or to register go to www4gotomeetingcomregister162511015 the 70000 study analyzed 122000 home sales between 1998 and 2012 that were within 5 miles of 41 wind turbines in massachusetts it focused on four development periods from before a project is announced through post construction for projects within a half mile of an operating turbine the effect on home prices was about a half percent in the positive direction according to the report the study also compared the effect of wind turbines with the effects of other factors such as proximity to the beach major roads electricity transmission lines and landfills for example the effect of being near the beach had a positive effect of nearly 26 percent on home prices for properties near landfills the effect was a negative of 122 percent opponents of windenergy projects located near homes on cape cod however questioned the studys validity and pointed to experiences of residents in falmouth who say their home values have plummeted because of the townowned wind turbines thats the state falmouth resident barry funfar said about the clean energy center the state is pushing for 2000 megawatts of wind capacity funfar convinced falmouths zoning board of appeals last month that the turbines at the towns wastewater treatment plant are causing him health problems and affecting his homes value an appraisal in 2012 which did not take into account the proximity of the wind turbines valued his property at 714000 a more recent appraisal that included the turbines as a factor pegged funfars home as worth 429000 he said theyre killing us he said the towns assessors office values the home at 589500 we have some fundamental differences with this latest study as it differs dramatically from research by an independent national expert appraiser who found that home prices near wind turbines in massachusetts have plummeted by 15 to 40 percent windwise massachusetts board member lilliann green of wellfleet wrote in a statement all one has to do is to get out of the office and talk to homeowners living near wind turbines in falmouth and other communities who can not even sell their homes because of documented noise and health concerns there is no evidence in the study that the researchers talked to homeowners or realestate agents in massachusetts green wrote green wrote that appraisals of 20 homes near existing or proposed wind turbines by michael mccann president of mccann appraisal of chicago have shown that the projects are devastating to home values in addition the clean energy centers support for wind energy projects raises questions about the studys credibility green wrote barton and the studys authors however said there was no attempt to influence the results of the work the work is really theirs in terms of the modeling and the conclusions barton said about the authors carol atkinsonpalombo assistant professor with the university of connecticut department of geography and ben hoen staff research associate at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory atkinsonpalombo and hoen said they never felt pressured to arrive at a specific conclusion its an independent study and thats how it was commissioned atkinsonpalombo said the researchers also looked at whether the rate of sales affected the outcome but there were plenty of sales around the turbines so that was not the case she said atkinsonpalombo said there are other areas where more research may be done such as how attitudes toward wind energy affect the willingness of people to buy property near a turbine the outcome of the massachusettsspecific study lines up with a national study that used similar methodologies hoen said they can be thought of as complementary to each other he said of the two studies theyre really different though there were no expectations of what we were going to get when we started in on the massachusetts work the study can not help determine is a particular home will be affected by a particular project barton said if you try to zero down to the community level the reliability is not high enough in order to draw the same type of conclusions she said but the study doesnt show a discernible effect on property values on average barton said im aware that not everyone may agree with or like the results of the study she said adding however that a similar study in rhode island

four days up to a thousand militiamen armed with tanks antiaircraft guns and mortars would attack kurds entrenched in the hills the only reason they have been able to withstand the onslaught is that they began digging protective trenches and building bunkers with cement ceilings earlier this year the front lines here today evoke those of world war i but at the beginning of august following the deaths of around 100 fighters on the kurdish side and 500 on that of the is this front in northern syria suddenly grew quiet strangely quiet the besieged locals felt before realizing that the main

reported that the us has begun directly providing weapons and munitions to the peshmerga the us is also considering possible ways to evacuate those trapped in the mountains outside qaraqosh initially the is attacks in june provided the kurds with the opportunity to take areas that they viewed to be kurdish now though it means they have a front line with the jihadists that is almost 1000 kilometers

            "text": "With the exception of a few birds defying the sweltering midday heat, all is quiet on the front, with Kurdish fighters cowering in the shade of the cliffs. Suddenly, sentence fragments from Friday prayers can be heard on the banks of the Euphrates River. \"Gather together ... smash the traitors of the faith!\" The words from the preacher, distorted by the amplifiers so loved by the jihadists, sound almost spooky.\n\nDown along the river, the jihadists with the Islamic State (IS) gather together for the next attack. A few hundred meters above on the sparse, sun-drenched hills, the Kurds are sitting, feeling like they've somehow ended up on the set of a horror film.\n\n\"What do they want from us,\" asks one young fighter who only a few weeks ago still worked as a cashier in a supermarket. \"These madmen keep on attacking and they continue to come at us even after they've been shot. I hit one of them twice. He only stopped after he was shot in the head. They're insane. They come here to die.\"\n\nKoban�, known as Ayn al-Arab in Arabic, is a small Kurdish enclave in northern Syria located on the border with Turkey. Since January it has been under siege by IS because Koban� is located directly in the middle of the terrorist militia's self-declared caliphate. Throughout the entire month of July, every three to four days, up to a thousand militiamen armed with tanks, anti-aircraft guns and mortars would attack Kurds entrenched in the hills. The only reason they have been able to withstand the onslaught is that they began digging protective trenches and building bunkers with cement ceilings earlier this year. The front lines here today evoke those of World War I.\n\nBut at the beginning of August, following the deaths of around 100 fighters on the Kurdish side and 500 on that of the IS, this front in northern Syria suddenly grew quiet. Strangely quiet, the besieged locals felt -- before realizing that the main jihadist force had moved around 300 Kilometers (186 miles) to the east into northern Iraq.\n\nAfter a long period of relative quiet, the IS fighters then surprised residents with a major offensive. Within just days, they had overrun Iraqi cities that had been protected by Kurdish peshmerga fighters. First they took the city of Sinjar, located west of Mosul near the Syrian border. Then they took the Christian city of Qaraqosh and Bartella near Mosul. By Friday, some of the fighters were within 30 kilometers of Erbil, the capital of the Iraqi Kurdistan region.\n\nFor the international community, the swiftness with which the peshmerga were forced to retreat came unexpectedly, as did the mass exodus triggered by the IS fighters. Over 100,000 people tried to flee to safety last week.\n\nThe rapid advance compelled the United States, 11 years after the start of the Iraq war and almost three years after the official withdrawal of troops, to once again intervene militarily over the weekend. F/A-18 fighter jets and drones conducted targeted air strikes in northern Iraq, using laser-guided bombs against mobile artillery used by the Islamic State in order to halt the fighters' advance on Erbil. Secretary of State John Kerry accused the Islamists of \"targeted acts of violence\" that \"bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide\" and must be prevented. Following the dramatic news and photos of the fleeing Yazidis and Christians, the United Nations Security Council unanimously condemned the developments.\n\nIS fighters had already arrived in Sinjar a week ago Sunday. The city is the stronghold in Iraq for Yazidis, an ancient, pre-Muslim religious community, with roots in Zoroastrianism, whose members worship seven angels, including a peacock angel, in addition to god. Radical Muslims have persecuted them as \"devil worshippers.\"\n\nKurdish troops defended the city for several hours before running out of ammunition. Reports that IS fighters had killed hundreds, or even more than a thousand, of Yazidis could not be confirmed. But fear is widespread, the consequence of barbaric photos and videos posted by the Islamic State in the Internet, some showing shot or beheaded victims. They are turning their reputation for cruelty into a weapon.\n\nResidents fled in long columns of vehicles to the Kurdish cities of Dohuk and Erbil, located around 200 kilometers to the east. But not all made it out. Those without vehicles or who waited too long to make their escape made it as far as the nearby mountains, arid crags devoid of food and water.\n\nLast week, thousands were holding out there, besieged by the jihadists. \"There are 700 families here and the first six people have already died of thirst,\" Khoder Darwish Suliman, the father of a fleeing Yazidi family said by mobile phone, describing the situation. \"Three were children. There is no water here, nothing to eat, absolutely nothing.\" He said people were too afraid to return to their homes. \"They're killing us,\" he said. On Friday, aircraft from the US and elsewhere began dropping humanitarian aid supplies over the mountains as the Iraqi air force had previously done. By then, Suliman could no longer be reached by phone.\n\nThe situation in Qaraqosh, a Christian city located 30 kilometers from Mosul, has also changed dramatically in the past week. Some 40,000 Christians lived in the city, which is home to 12 churches and a mosque. In June, a SPIEGEL reporter traveled to Qaraqosh and told the story of Salam Kihkhwa, a 31-year-old Catholic. The small house at the entrance to the city where he lived with his parents now stands empty. The family fled at 8 p.m. last Thursday. It was the moment at which the jihadists finally occupied Qaraqosh.\n\nIn the days prior, Salam had been posting horror stories on Facebook from nearby towns, sent to him by friends. And the IS had also been intimidating Qaraqosh residents, cutting off electricity and water supplies. \"I don't want to become a refugee and have to live in another country for years,\" he wrote. He added that he and his family had wanted to remain in their hometown for as long as possible.\n\n'Flight Or Death Is the Only Choice'\n\nOn Friday morning, Salam told his own story be phone from Erbil. His voice was shaky from exhaustion and lack of sleep. He said that on Friday, a shell struck near his house, Salam saw dust rise, heard people scream and could then see them running away. \"We heard heavy fighting the whole day,\" he says. Hours later, the streets had emptied completely. The Kurdish peshmerga did all they could to hold on to the city. \"We were so scared we could hardly breathe,\" Salam says. As the first Kurdish fighters began to retreat in resignation that evening, people began leaving their homes. Salam and his parents also squeezed into a car together with their neighbors. Tens of thousands fled Qaraqosh. It would take them several hours to make the 30-kilometer trip to Erbil.\n\nSalam is now living together with seven other families at his cousin's place in the Kurdish capital. He says that many Iraqi Christians have now been left homeless. He has since spoken to acquaintances who hid in Qaraqosh's only mosque. IS militants, they said, have raised the black flag in the city and ordered all remaining Christians to leave. \"Flight or death is the only choice we have,\" Salam says.\n\nOn Friday, the British government advised its citizens to leave Erbil because of the advance of the IS and due to concern that the peshmerga would soon run out of ammunition. As early as June, the Kurdish fighters had been ordered only to fire at nearby attackers because of the shortage. Those concerns, however, may now be easing after it was reported that the US has begun directly providing weapons and munitions to the peshmerga. The US is also considering possible ways to evacuate those trapped in the mountains outside Qaraqosh.\n\nInitially, the IS attacks in June provided the Kurds with the opportunity to take areas that they viewed to be Kurdish. Now, though, it means they have a front line with the jihadists that is almost 1,000 kilometers long. In an interview with the Washington Post at the end of July, Masrour Barzani, the Kurdistan Regional Government's intelligence and security chief, said the Kurds had asked the US for assistance but had gotten \"not a single bullet. This is the truth that the world should know. So we are left out to fight all these terrorists, all these problems on our own.\"\n\nUS air strikes on IS positions over the weekend and into Monday -- along with the weapons deliveries indicate that is now changing. But the IS \"caliphate,\" which it declared at the end of June, now stretches from the steppe between Marea and Al-Bab in northwestern Syria to an around 100 kilometers outside of Baghdad. Almost the entire border between the two countries is under the control of the IS.\n\nAnd while the IS may be reminiscent of al-Qaida and earlier jihadist groups in terms of its propaganda, there is a significant difference. The IS acts strategically and with a clear goal: to bring as much land, money, people, weapons and infrastructure as possible under its control.\n\nThe radicals have profited from the months-long stalemate among various political factions in Iraq. It has been made worse by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's unwillingness to step down, despite a parliamentary majority demand that he do so. That has hindered the creation of a new government in Baghdad. With a sectarian agenda backed by Iran aimed at bringing the country under Shiite control, Al-Maliki has incensed both Sunni Arabs and Kurds in the north of the country. On Monday, Maliki even deployed elite security forces in Baghdad, underscoring his demands that the country's new president name him to form a new government.\n\nThe IS advance would hardly be possible without support from Iraqi Sunnis. Indeed, former US advisor Ali Khedery says the disillusioned Sunnis have \"chosen to consummate a deal with the devil.\" IS commandos, after all, haven't been picky about who they attack. In Mosul, former military officers and Baath Party bigwigs from the era of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, have been arrested or have disappeared without a trace. In Tikrit, leaders of aligned Sunni Islamists like the Naqshbandi Army have been intimidated or murdered.\n\nUS President Barack Obama had been eager to avoid intervention in Iraq absent a new government in Baghdad. But the American air strikes on IS positions still won't solve the fundamental conflicts in these two countries -- conflicts that paved the way for the meteoric rise of the IS in the first place.\n\nFor some time now, the lack of strong governments in Iraq and Syria has allowed the IS to operate freely in large swaths of the region. The world, this week, is watching. But it continues to ignore what is happening in northern Syria. The IS is continuing its seige of Koban� and the Turks have sealed the border to Kurds attempting to flee. At the same time, Turkish officials are doing hardly anything to hinder jihadists who travel in and out of Turkish airports as they make their way into the region.",
