military cooperation with georgia as tension continues to fester between russia and the west from july 911 the head of us transportation command ustranscom general paul selva visited georgia and held discussions with officials including the president prime minister and defense minister the substance of the talks appeared to focus heavily on issues of military transit as one of several routes that the united states and nato use to get equipment in and out of landlocked afghanistan is through georgia its also likely that general selva discussed the administrations new european reassurance initiative where an estimated 35 milllion would go to georgia to help build partner capacity according to stars and stripes at the moment the vast majority of equipment going to afghanistan is shipped via pakistan the closest route to the sea but rocky relations with pakistan led the united states to set up the northern distribution network ndn through the former soviet union as a strategic hedge in case the pakistan route becomes unavailable ustranscom officials say that the route via russia is still working smoothly in spite of increased tension with putin but selvas visit may indicate a desire by the pentagon to reroute equipment via azerbaijan and georgia but georgias ability to accommodate more us military traffic has been hampered by delays to a new rail line that it azerbaijan

nato summit to drive changes to deal with a threat from russia the committee added the nato alliance has not considered russia as an adversary or a potential territorial threat to its member states for 20 years said the report it is now forced to do so as a result of russias recent actions stewart said the transatlantic alliance had to expand from its current focus on terror and failed states to deal with a russian threat using a different set of tactics to the cold war the instability in russia president putins worldview and the failure of the west to respond actively in ukraine means that we now have to address urgently the possibility however small of russia repeating such tactics elsewhere nato spokeswoman oana lungescu said the alliance would discuss a plan of action for russia at the september summit we have not seen the report by the uk defence select committee but well study it carefully once its published she said nato has already taken measures to reinforce collective

from monday until friday in its central and western districts the spokesman igor klimov said the exercises were the first in a series to improve coordination in the military and made no mention of ukraine where prorussian rebels are fighting ukrainian government forces the move is likely to alarm western powers which have accused russia of beefing up the number of troops along its border with ukraine and arming the rebels in eastern ukraine moscow denies supplying the rebels with weapons klimov said aircraft such as su27 and mig31 fighter jets russias newest frontline bomber su34 and mi8 mi24 and mi28n helicopters would be used in the exercises and the aircraft would conduct missile practice the aircraft will be testing aircraft weapons on land and air targets on new ranges and will

business by carrying out more military exercises and deploying more weapons to protect europes eastern borders david cameron has said in a letter to nato leaders ahead of a summit next month the prime minister said the alliance had to make clear to russia that neither nato nor its members will be intimidated he also strongly hinted that he wants defence spending to start to increase now that western democracies economies are starting to recover tension between russia and the west mounted on friday with vladimir putin telling barack obama that sanctions imposed on moscow over the ukraine crisis were counterproductive and the current situation was not in the interests of either country mr cameron said that nato member states had to strengthen our ability to respond quickly to any threat to reassure those allies who fear for their own countrys security and to deter any russian aggression he said that russia has ripped up the rule book with its illegal annexation of crimea and aggressive destabilisation of ukraine the prime minister said that he recognised existing treaties with russia meant that nato was not allowed to station a standing army in eastern europe next months summit in newport wales should look to step up nato activities and should agree a new exercise schedule adapted to the new security environment the alliance should also look to move more military hardware into the region and consider how to strengthen the reaction times of its response force mr cameron said natos headquarters in szczecin poland which was established only in 1999 is likely to be expanded to cope with the new threat from the east mr cameron who is visiting the headquarters early next week said this should be part of a broader action plan that enables us to respond more quickly to any threat against any member of the alliance including when we have little warning russias annexation of crimea and its continued destabilisation of eastern ukraine meant that nato had to review our long term relationship with russia he said while nato has only ever sought to be a partner to russia not a threat it is clear that russia views nato as an adversary we must accept that the cooperation of recent years is not currently possible because of russias own illegal actions in natos neighbourhood and revisit the principles that guide our relationship with russia mr cameron also said he wanted nato to learn from the wests experience in afghanistan and build new defence capacity in georgia parts of which are still occupied by russian troops last month a former nato deputy supreme commander warned that the alliance would be unable to respond if mr putin ordered a sudden attack gen sir richard shirreff said the only way to absolutely guarantee that countries such as latvia lithuania and estonia are protected from russia was to have troops in place he said there is a russian aviation base within 45 minutes flying time of riga unless nato has stationed forces within the baltics i think its highly unlikely that nato could respond to a sudden attack mr cameron will also use next months summit to press other countries in the alliance to start to increase defence spending to cope with an unstable world of failed states regional conflicts terrorism and cyberattacks he said we must ensure that nato has the capabilities it needs to respond to changing threats that requires investment the uk is already one of four members of the alliance to meet the target of spending 2 per cent of our gdp on defence and i would urge other allies to make the strongest possible commitment to increase their defence spending and to devote at least one fifth of it to equipment and research as our economies start to recover reversing the decline in defence

Unless Nato has stationed forces within the Baltics, I think it's highly unlikely that Nato could respond to a sudden attack.\"Mr Cameron will also use next month's summit to press other countries in the alliance to start to increase defence spending to cope with \"an unstable world of failed states, regional conflicts, terrorism and cyber-attacks\".He said: \"We must ensure that Nato has the capabilities it needs to respond to changing threats. That requires investment. The UK is already one of four members of the alliance to meet the target of spending 2 per cent of our GDP on defence and I would urge other allies to make the strongest possible commitment to increase their defence spending, and to devote at least one fifth of it to equipment and research. As our economies start to recover, reversing the decline in defence spending and investing in our defence capabilities would strengthen alliance cohesion and signal that Nato means business.\"",

the restart of ukraines campaign to quash the separatist uprising in donetsk and luhansk oblasts on july 1 in fact it was perhaps the militarys biggest achievement in recent days – maybe weeks – as the crossing is believed to have been a route for the transport of rebel reinforcements from russia to ukraine and it came with no casualties to ukrainian servicemen or civilians it is not known whether rebel fighters suffered injuries or died in the fight but elsewhere ukraines antiterrorist operation now nearly three months old has enjoyed much less success while government forces have

cities towns for weeks ukrainian forces have bombarded the separatist bastion of sloviansk in donetsk oblast with small arms mortars and heavy artillery in doing so they say they have liquidated

            "body": "in russianruled crimea a crackdown on journalists and activists who dont toe kremlin line the entrance to the simferopol trade union building which stands opposite the cabinet of ministers on lenin square has been obstructed daily by members of socalled crimean selfdefense militias since march these men dressed in camouflage and armed with police batons and sometimes guns wander into the building freely where their frequent destination is the office of the center for investigative journalism weve all come across them says journalist tatiana kurmanova wearily they make no concrete demands they just have the affect of scaring us – imagine the first time when they came in here with pistols looking at everything the center financed through grants from the us agency for international development and other foreign donors was one of the first media organizations to receive such unwanted attention in russiacontrolled crimea if russian president vladimir putin remains in control of ukraines peninsula and follows the same policy for crimea that he does with the rest of the russian federation then foreignfunded projects in particular those with usaid funding will be targets for shutdown the crimean selfdefense members marched into the journalism centers office on march 1 two days after soldiers without insignia appeared throughout the peninsula and set in motion the russian invasion and occupation or – as russian law would have it annexation of crimea the selfdefense militias ungoverned by any law have since become a permanent fixture of daily life in crimea patrolling streets guarding transport hubs and government buildings demanding to see the documents of passersby – and harassing journalists while attacks on media have abated somewhat since march when the center for investigative journalism recorded 85 incidents crimea has by no mean become a safe place for journalists in the last six weeks andrey krisko who heads the crimean human rights field mission has registered nine serious incidents of harassment of journalists involving personal harm damage to equipment and illegal detention for more than three hours he experienced one such incident himself when he was physically prevented from taking pictures of a journalist arguing with selfdefense forces on may 17 later he found out the journalist had been followed and detained most cases krisko said concern not single but groups of journalists and all cases involve the selfdefense militias some cases have been widely publicized like that of journalist osman pashayev on may 18 the number of incidents of harassment and censorship against journalists has increased since the russian takeover of ukraines crimean peninsula in march pashayev was filming the crimean tatar meeting commemorating 70 years of their deportation and the hundreds of riot police guarding simferopol city center when selfdefense forces detained both him and his turkish cameraman they were held for 10 hours had all their equipment taken away and were denied access to lawyers until a threatened appeal to the prosecutors office kurmanova thinks there are probably many more such incidents involving the selfdefense and russian federal security service or fsb under its russian acronym but journalists working for crimean government media do not want to publicize them most of the journalists who have spoken publicly like pashayev left crimea afterwards as soon as they could meanwhile four crimean civil activists who supported the euromaidan revolution that ousted president viktor yanukovych on feb 22 and protested against russian occupation are currently thought to be detained by the fsb two film director oleg sentsov and alexandr kolchenko are believed to be under arrest and possibly already in moscow to face terrorism charges the whereabouts of timur shaimardanov and leonid korzh reported missing by the ukrainian organisation ukrainian house on may 28 are unknown kateryna serhatskova a journalist and coordinator of an initiative group to help the film director sentsov has said that sentsov kolchenko and two other activists held oleksiy chyrniy and hennadiy afanasyev have never been members of the right sector for those who have doubts these guys have never been members of the right sector and prepared no terrorist attacks these are absolutely peaceful people who maintained the integrity of ukraine now confessions are being forced out of them and probably one of them will admit his guilt all in all its outrageous nonsense no comment serhatskova wrote on her facebook page on may 30 according to interfaxukraine news service the fsb earlier reported the detention in the republic of crimea of members of ukraines ultranationalistic right sector suspected of plotting to stage acts of sabotage and terrorist attacks in several cities of the peninsula the effect of this intimidation has been to effectively silence critical or opposition media to the russian annexation within crimea tv channel atr and the website 15 minutes both owned by crimean tatar businessman lenur islyamov have greatly cut down on their live programming and news coverage since march the only other independent agencies left the center for investigative journalism and the radio libertysupported project crimean reality both have regular problems with the selfdefense militias this situation when there are these groups that dont answer to anyone that arent controlled by any law means its impossible to say journalists can work professionally here says krisko the risk of damage to equipment or personal attacks as well as fear of censorship means that those who want to give objective information simply cant in methods reminiscent of soviet tactics smear campaigns censorship and simple exclusion by news sources are also silencing journalists who might want to show a less onesided prorussian view of current affairs in crimea kurmanova and her colleagues regularly receive online threats and hate mail since the beginning of march meanwhile two journalists from the yevpatoria councilfunded newspaper yevpatoria health resort who had been less than enthusiastic about russian occupation became subject to an attempted witch hunt in may when rival journalists sent a letter accusing them of being spies and provocateurs to the city council we dont demand the exile of these people from their town and their profession according to the letter but we yevpatorians do not need these masked fifth columnists in our hometown and paid from the town budget it concludes by saying that if the town council does not remove them from the paper we will appeal to the fsb demanding they protect us russian citizens from journalists openly conducting subversive activities the two journalists have so far held on to their jobs and did not want to comment further on the incident since the end of february when a new crimean parliament was announced journalists from the center for investigative journalism have not been able to get parliamentary accreditation lawmakers refuse to speak to them or call them american spies the crimean cabinet of ministers press service does not answer their calls they are not informed of meetings and press conferences or are denied entry theres a very clear difference between journalists from russian media who can get into the offices of officials and anywhere else with no problem and journalists from ukrainian media who might ask awkward questions says kurmanova were like white crows no one wants to talk to us before it was all organised we could write a request for information or set up filming now we get our information in bits and pieces grabbing officials outside buildings if they agree to speak shevket ganiyev editorinchief of crimean tatar programming at the crimean state broadcasting company trk was excluded from news coverage through a different method he and his director were simply sent home for a months holiday ganiyevs small amount of allotted live broadcasting had already been taken off air with no warning in march before a hastilyorganised referendum on joining crimea to russia ganiyev and his colleagues who like most crimean tatars openly opposed the referendum then agreed with trk management which openly supported it that his department would boycott working at trk until after the referendum when his team came back on air they were subject to much closer control on april 24 they were told they could not make any mention at all of crimean tatar governing body the mejlis or of crimean tatar leaders mustafa jemilev and refat chubarov in their programming this has meant the editorial has had to ignore events widely covered in the international media – including russian if theres news in russian media and we are not allowed to talk about it how can any journalist accept this as normal asks ganiyev were not just banned from talking about the mejlis as good or bad we are not even allowed to cover facts the same day as the ban ganiyev and the editorial director were asked by trk management to take a months leave of course they didnt say so but i think they had to send us on holiday because then our collective would be easier to control says ganiyev may was a worrying time for them because of the 70th anniversary of the crimean tatar deportation and events connected with that i think they were scared and tried to protect themselves ganiyev was back at work from may 28 but he and his team have no idea what the future will bring amid the general upheaval at trk which was formerly funded by the ukrainian government but is now is a state of stasis for the crimean tatar editorial this is yet another setback in their fight for more airtime in their own language their live airtime was reduced over a year ago to 13 minutes news a day and their recorded programming is exclusively about cultural and social matters were hostages in this situation says ganiyev for us the most important things are to preserve our work places and editorial so that we can broadcast in crimean tatar language if tomorrow they kick us out and bring in new journalists who are convenient for them and who speak in incorrect crimean tatar theyll be pleased because it will start the assimilation of our language under the ukrainian license still being used at trk crimean tatar language is allotted seven percent of overall airtime ukrainian language programming before march was even more limited since march one of just three weekly ukrainian language programmes has switched to russian svetlana datsenko editor of one of the two remaining ukrainian programmes said she had also been asked to switch to russian if there are three equal state languages in crimea then there should be proportional coverage 33 percent for each language ganiyev points out but neither he nor datsenko have much expectation of that happening the new head of trk boris nemets is from crimean government head sergei aksyonovs russian unity party as is the new crimean minister for information the partys key campaigning platform is russian language rights as crimea moves rapidly towards adopting russian legislation the situation for a free media is only set to get worse on top of harassment and exclusion staff of the center for investigative journalism have a whole array of logistical problems to deal with their salaries paid from foreign donors are frozen as the crimean banking system has collapsed they have been told to vacate their rented offices by the end of july russian legislation which comes into force in crimea in january requires that their organisation register as a foreign agent and completely bans their main donor usaid increasingly repressive russian laws can shut down opposition websites and impose prison sentences on anyone questioning russian territorial integrity which would include crimea in the media meanwhile a law legalizing the selfdefense militias has already passed its first reading in the crimean parliament according to kurmanova it grants the militias a wide range of powers to stop search confiscate and detain with minimum responsibilities as state media in crimea produces a soothing stream of information about a bright russian future ignoring the economic and social problems since annexation and downplaying or disregarding nonrussian ethnic groups it is little surprise that kurmanova and datsenko from trk both plan to leave crimea for mainland ukraine by the end of the summer we had strict editorial standards and i suppose thats why its hardest of all for us because now no one here needs such editorial standards says kurmanova its easier just not to ask questions and to keep quiet editors note

            "text": "The entrance to the Simferopol Trade Union building, which stands opposite the Cabinet of Ministers on Lenin Square, has been obstructed daily by members of so-called Crimean self-defense militias since March. These men, dressed in camouflage and armed with police batons and sometimes guns, wander into the building freely, where their frequent destination is the office of the Center for Investigative Journalism.\n\n“We’ve all come across them,” says journalist Tatiana Kurmanova wearily. “They make no concrete demands. They just have the affect of scaring us – imagine the first time when they came in here with pistols, looking at everything.”\n\nThe center, financed through grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development and other foreign donors, was one of the first media organizations to receive such unwanted attention in Russia-controlled Crimea.\n\nIf Russian President Vladimir Putin remains in control of Ukraine's peninsula and follows the same policy for Crimea that he does with the rest of the Russian Federation, then foreign-funded projects -- in particular those with USAID funding - will be targets for shutdown.\n\nThe Crimean self-defense members marched into the journalism center's office on March 1, two days after soldiers without insignia appeared throughout the peninsula and set in motion the Russian invasion and occupation or – as Russian law would have it - annexation of Crimea.\n\nThe self-defense militias, ungoverned by any law, have since become a permanent fixture of daily life in Crimea, patrolling streets, guarding transport hubs and government buildings, demanding to see the documents of passersby – and harassing journalists.\n\nWhile attacks on media have abated somewhat since March, when the Center for Investigative Journalism recorded 85 incidents, Crimea has by no mean become a safe place for journalists\n\nIn the last six weeks, Andrey Krisko, who heads the Crimean Human Rights Field Mission, has registered nine serious incidents of harassment of journalists, involving personal harm, damage to equipment, and illegal detention for more than three hours. He experienced one such incident himself, when he was physically prevented from taking pictures of a journalist arguing with self-defense forces on May 17. Later, he found out the journalist had been followed and detained.\n\nMost cases, Krisko said, concern not single but groups of journalists, and all cases involve the self-defense militias. Some cases have been widely publicized, like that of journalist Osman Pashayev on May 18.\n\nThe number of incidents of harassment and censorship against journalists has increased since the Russian takeover of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in March.\n\nPashayev was filming the Crimean Tatar meeting commemorating 70 years of their deportation, and the hundreds of riot police guarding Simferopol city center, when self-defense forces detained both him and his Turkish cameraman. They were held for 10 hours, had all their equipment taken away, and were denied access to lawyers until a threatened appeal to the prosecutors office.\n\nKurmanova thinks there are probably many more such incidents involving the self-defense and Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB under its Russian acronym, but journalists working for Crimean government media do not want to publicize them.\n\nMost of the journalists who have spoken publicly, like Pashayev, left Crimea afterwards as soon as they could.\n\nMeanwhile four Crimean civil activists who supported the EuroMaidan Revolution that ousted President Viktor Yanukovych on Feb. 22 and protested against Russian occupation are currently thought to be detained by the FSB.\n\nTwo, film director Oleg Sentsov and Alexandr Kolchenko, are believed to be under arrest and possibly already in Moscow to face terrorism charges. The whereabouts of Timur Shaimardanov and Leonid Korzh, reported missing by the Ukrainian organisation Ukrainian House on May 28, are unknown.\n\nKateryna Serhatskova, a journalist and coordinator of an initiative group to help the film director Sentsov, has said that Sentsov, Kolchenko and two other activists held -- Oleksiy Chyrniy and Hennadiy Afanasyev -- have never been members of the Right Sector.\n\n\"For those who have doubts: these guys have never been members of the Right Sector and prepared no terrorist attacks, these are absolutely peaceful people, who maintained the integrity of Ukraine. Now confessions are being forced out of them, and probably one of them will admit his guilt all in all. It's outrageous nonsense. No comment,\" Serhatskova wrote on her Facebook page on May 30, according to Interfax-Ukraine news service.\n\nThe FSB earlier reported the detention in the Republic of Crimea of members of Ukraine's ultra-nationalistic Right Sector suspected of plotting to stage acts of sabotage and terrorist attacks in several cities of the peninsula.\n\nThe effect of this intimidation has been to effectively silence critical or opposition media to the Russian annexation within Crimea.\n\nTV channel ATR and the website 15 Minutes, both owned by Crimean Tatar businessman Lenur Islyamov, have greatly cut down on their live programming and news coverage since March. The only other independent agencies left, the Center for Investigative Journalism and the Radio Liberty-supported project Crimean Reality, both have regular problems with the self-defense militias.\n\n“This situation when there are these groups that don’t answer to anyone, that aren’t controlled by any law, means it’s impossible to say journalists can work professionally here,” says Krisko. “The risk of damage to equipment or personal attacks, as well as fear of censorship, means that those who want to give objective information simply can’t.”\n\nIn methods reminiscent of Soviet tactics, smear campaigns, censorship and simple exclusion by news sources are also silencing journalists who might want to show a less one-sided, pro-Russian view of current affairs in Crimea\n\nKurmanova and her colleagues regularly receive online threats and hate mail since the beginning of March. Meanwhile two journalists from the Yevpatoria council-funded newspaper Yevpatoria Health Resort, who had been less than enthusiastic about Russian occupation, became subject to an attempted witch hunt in May when rival journalists sent a letter accusing them of being spies and provocateurs to the city council.\n\n\"We don’t demand the exile of these people from their town and their profession,\" according to the letter. \"But we Yevpatorians do not need these masked ‘fifth columnists’ in our hometown, and paid from the town budget!\" It concludes by saying that if the town council does not remove them from the paper \"We will appeal to the FSB demanding they protect us Russian citizens from journalists openly conducting subversive activities.\"\n\nThe two journalists have so far held on to their jobs, and did not want to comment further on the incident.\n\nSince the end of February, when a new Crimean parliament was announced, journalists from the Center for Investigative Journalism have not been able to get parliamentary accreditation. Lawmakers refuse to speak to them, or call them \"American spies.\" The Crimean Cabinet of Ministers’ press service does not answer their calls. They are not informed of meetings and press conferences, or are denied entry.\n\n“There’s a very clear difference between journalists from Russian media who can get into the offices of officials and anywhere else with no problem, and journalists from Ukrainian media who might ask awkward questions,” says Kurmanova\n\n“We’re like white crows; no one wants to talk to us. Before it was all organised, we could write a request for information, or set up filming. Now we get our information in bits and pieces, grabbing officials outside buildings, if they agree to speak.”\n\nShevket Ganiyev, editor-in-chief of Crimean Tatar programming at the Crimean state broadcasting company TRK, was excluded from news coverage through a different method: He and his director were simply sent home for a month’s holiday.\n\nGaniyev’s small amount of allotted live broadcasting had already been taken off air with no warning in March, before a hastily-organised referendum on joining Crimea to Russia. Ganiyev and his colleagues, who like most Crimean Tatars openly opposed the referendum, then agreed with TRK management (which openly supported it) that his department would boycott working at TRK until after the referendum.\n\nWhen his team came back on air, they were subject to much closer control. On April 24, they were told they could not make any mention at all of Crimean Tatar governing body the Mejlis, or of Crimean Tatar leaders Mustafa Jemilev and Refat Chubarov in their programming. This has meant the editorial has had to ignore events widely covered in the international media – including Russian.\n\n“If there’s news in Russian media and we are not allowed to talk about it, how can any journalist accept this as normal?” asks Ganiyev. “We’re not just banned from talking about the Mejlis as good or bad. We are not even allowed to cover facts.”\n\nThe same day as the ban, Ganiyev and the editorial director were asked by TRK management to take a month’s leave.\n\n“Of course they didn’t say so, but I think they had to send us on holiday because then our collective would be easier to control,” says Ganiyev. “May was a worrying time for them because of the 70th anniversary of the [Crimean Tatar] deportation and events connected with that. I think they were scared and tried to protect themselves.”\n\nGaniyev was back at work from May 28, but he and his team have no idea what the future will bring amid the general upheaval at TRK, which was formerly funded by the Ukrainian government but is now is a state of stasis. For the Crimean Tatar editorial, this is yet another set-back in their fight for more airtime in their own language. Their live airtime was reduced over a year ago to 13 minutes news a day, and their recorded programming is exclusively about cultural and social matters.\n\n“We’re hostages in this situation,” says Ganiyev. “For us, the most important things are to preserve our work places and editorial so that we can broadcast in Crimean Tatar language. If tomorrow they kick us out and bring in new journalists who are convenient for them and who speak in incorrect Crimean Tatar they’ll be pleased, because it will start the assimilation of our language.”\n\nUnder the Ukrainian license still being used at TRK, Crimean Tatar language is allotted seven percent of overall airtime. Ukrainian language programming before March was even more limited. Since March, one of just three weekly Ukrainian language programmes has switched to Russian. Svetlana Datsenko, editor of one of the two remaining Ukrainian programmes, said she had also been asked to switch to Russian.\n\n“If there are three equal state languages in Crimea then there should be proportional coverage, 33 percent for each language,” Ganiyev points out. But neither he nor Datsenko have much expectation of that happening. The new head of TRK, Boris Nemets, is from Crimean government head Sergei Aksyonov’s Russian Unity party, as is the new Crimean minister for information. The party’s key campaigning platform is Russian language rights.\n\nAs Crimea moves rapidly towards adopting Russian legislation, the situation for a free media is only set to get worse. On top of harassment and exclusion, staff of the Center for Investigative Journalism have a whole array of logistical problems to deal with. Their salaries, paid from foreign donors, are frozen as the Crimean banking system has collapsed. They have been told to vacate their rented offices by the end of July. Russian legislation, which comes into force in Crimea in January, requires that their organisation register as a foreign agent, and completely bans their main donor, USAID. Increasingly repressive Russian laws can shut down opposition websites, and impose prison sentences on anyone questioning Russian territorial integrity (which would include Crimea) in the media.\n\nMeanwhile a law legalizing the self-defense militias has already passed its first reading in the Crimean parliament. According to Kurmanova, it grants the militias a wide range of powers to stop, search, confiscate and detain, with minimum responsibilities.\n\nAs state media in Crimea produces a soothing stream of information about a bright Russian future, ignoring the economic and social problems since annexation and downplaying or disregarding non-Russian ethnic groups, it is little surprise that Kurmanova and Datsenko from TRK both plan to leave Crimea for mainland Ukraine by the end of the summer.\n\n“We had strict editorial standards and I suppose that’s why it's hardest of all for us, because now no one here needs such editorial standards,’ says Kurmanova. “It’s easier just not to ask questions and to keep quiet.”\n\nEditor’s Note: This article has been produced for Kyivpost with support from www.mymedia.org.ua, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and implemented by a joint venture between NIRAS and BBC Media Action.

would dodge the bullets that whizzed past and heavy artillery that exploded loudly on the citys outskirts they stayed inside except for the few trips needed to buy provisions on july 2 amid an exchange of mortar fire by the two groups she was nearly killed when a shell hit her building reducing a fivefloor section of it to rubble today a cabinet teeters precariously on a topfloor ledge of

maximovna reznychenko – but her neighbors say they arent sure she was seen bleeding profusely from the neck when medics took her away they say but they havent received news since fyodorovna and her neighbors had endured weeks of heavy fighting that knocked out power destroyed water lines and cut off gas to residents and yet just 21 of 126 people who reside in her building at bovarnya 4 in sloviansks artema district fled she decided to stay put as did her neighbor sasha who declined to give his last name where are we to go sasha asked rhetorically saying that a lack of money prevented

republic told separatists at a rally at donetsks central lenin square on july 6 we will drown these wretches in blood ukraine restarted its military offensive on july 1 following president petro poroshenkos refusal to extend a 10day ceasefire declared on june 20 because of multiple violations on the kremlinbacked side that led to the deaths of 27 ukrainian soldiers two days after reclaiming sloviansk which kyiv has painted as a major turning point in its fight against separatists ukraines interior minister arsen avakov made some big promises to its residents in an attempt to win hearts and minds in sloviansks central lenin square with the blue and yellow ukrainian flag waving behind him – a sight not seen here for months – avakov on july 7 pledged to restore power running water and public transportation in sloviansk as soon as possible we are working on it right now and some electricity should be restored today the transport minister will arrive shortly to assess the situation with transportation he said he also vowed to rid the city of tens of block posts and dozens of barricades erected by the rebels to keep ukrainian troops from penetrating the stronghold adding that pensions would begin being paid again immediately information the countrys treasury department reiterated one woman wept when she heard that her lights might soon be turned on but for the most part the ministers words were met with skepticism asked by a local woman in a blue rain slicker outside the city hall what kind of city sloviansk would become avakov said a beautiful one but the road to full restoration is sure to be long and rocky as sloviansk remains severely scarred although still mostly intact it will be a long time before any semblance of normalcy returns here shattered glass power lines and trolleybus cables are strewn across streets marked by giant potholes and the scorched carcasses of vehicles gas stations are destroyed and several apartment blocks have been ravaged – their rooftops caved in or their walls completely blown to bits – and perhaps beyond repair the neighboring village of semyonivka which felt the brunt of kyivs military bombardment has been completely razed debris from homes and businesses are scattered everywhere dozens of unexploded mortars stuck in the pavement precariously mark the roads on july 7 a weeping woman soaked from afternoon showers walked barefoot through the desiccated village toward sloviansk besides a small dog she was the only sign of life there and then there is the psychological damage which will take much longer to repair while residents are pleased that much of the heavy fighting is over not all are happy to have been liberated by government troops some say are under the command of fascists and the junta in kyiv for whom they harbor deep resentment and blame for much of the surrounding destruction how can we ever forgive them after they have destroyed our homes said lyubov petrovna a local pensioner who worked as an engineer as a sloviansk plant for 45 years however she admitted that the ukrainian troops now controlling the city had been friendly to her they saved us from starvation she said she came to the citys central square to receive humanitarian aid handed out by ukrainian troops who had arrived with trucks full of bottled water bread pasta rice and other provisions the rebels who had controlled the city for months had not been so kind in providing for the population she said meanwhile they lived like kings she added while many were grateful for the muchneeded supplies earning the trust of residents here will be no easy task using the tactics such as those employed by oleh lyashko the controversial radical party leader and a member of parliament who garnered eight percent of the vote in mays presidential election and employs his own militias to fight the rebels inside sloviansks city hall on july 7 bolstered by armed men from the ukraine and azov battalions lyashko forced the head of

The transport minister will arrive shortly to assess the situation with transportation,” he said.\n\nHe also vowed to rid the city of tens of block posts and dozens of barricades erected by the rebels to keep Ukrainian troops from penetrating the stronghold, adding that pensions would begin being paid again immediately, information the country’s treasury department reiterated.\n\nOne woman wept when she heard that her lights might soon be turned on, but for the most part the minister’s words were met with skepticism.\n\nAsked by a local woman in a blue rain slicker outside the city hall what kind of city Sloviansk would become, Avakov said, “a beautiful one.”\n\nBut the road to full restoration is sure to be long and rocky, as Sloviansk remains severely scarred, although still mostly intact. It will be a long time before any semblance of normalcy returns here.\n\nShattered glass, power lines and trolleybus cables are strewn across streets marked by giant potholes and the scorched carcasses of vehicles. Gas stations are destroyed and several apartment blocks have been ravaged – their rooftops caved in or their walls completely blown to bits – and perhaps beyond repair.\n\nThe neighboring village of Semyonivka, which felt the brunt of Kyiv’s military bombardment, has been completely razed. Debris from homes and businesses are scattered everywhere, dozens of unexploded mortars stuck in the pavement precariously mark the roads.\n\nOn July 7, a weeping woman soaked from afternoon showers walked barefoot through the desiccated village toward Sloviansk. Besides a small dog, she was the only sign of life there.\n\nAnd then there is the psychological damage, which will take much longer to repair.\n\nWhile residents are pleased that much of the heavy fighting is over, not all are happy to have been liberated by government troops some say are under the command of “fascists” and the “junta” in Kyiv for whom they harbor deep resentment and blame for much of the surrounding destruction.\n\n“How can we ever forgive them, after they have destroyed our homes?” said Lyubov Petrovna, a local pensioner who worked as an engineer as a Sloviansk plant for 45 years. However, she admitted that the Ukrainian troops now controlling the city had been friendly to her.\n\n“They saved us from starvation,” she said. She came to the city’s central square to receive humanitarian aid handed out by Ukrainian troops who had arrived with trucks full of bottled water, bread, pasta, rice and other provisions.\n\nThe rebels who had controlled the city for months had not been so kind in providing for the population, she said. Meanwhile they lived “like kings,” she added.\n\nWhile many were grateful for the much-needed supplies, earning the trust of residents here will be no easy task using the tactics such as those employed by Oleh Lyashko, the controversial Radical Party leader and a member of parliament who garnered eight percent of the vote in May’s presidential election and employs his own militias to fight the rebels.\n\nInside Sloviansk’s city hall on July 7, bolstered by armed men from the Ukraine and Azov battalions, Lyashko forced the head of Sloviansk’s city council, a Party of Regions representative supported by many people here, to pen his resignation.\n\nAfter repeatedly resisting, the man wrote the notice with trembling hands. Then in a final act of humiliation, Lyashko ordered him, “Write, ‘Glory to Ukraine, death to occupiers.’”\n\nKyiv Post editor Christopher J.

Overall, however, Severodonetsk did not experience big fights as separatists retreated south.\n\nOleksiy Svetikov, a local journalist and activist, believes that billionaire Dmytro Firtash, owner of city’s biggest Azot chemical plant, helped convince – or pay – the separatists to leave.\n\nBut days later, many residents are still hiding in school basements because they fear shelling, which can still be heard from several miles away from the fierce fighting that is under way in Lysychansk.\n\nA few people gathered on July 23 at Severodonetsk’s main square, where a statue of Vladimir Lenin has a Ukrainian flag for a scarf.\n\nWhen spotting a group of three Berkut riot police officers from Kirovograd, who were patrolling the city to make sure there were no more Kremlin-backed separtists left in the city, many people approached to thank them and bring them some food. Seeing them Krasiuk, the businessman, ran up to them and started shaking their hands, furiously and friendly.\n\n“You can’t imagine how happy I am to see you guys here,” he said.\n\nKyiv Post staff writer Oksana Grytsenko can be reached at grytsenko@kyivpost.com\n\nEditor’s Note: This article has been produced with travel support from www.mymedia.org.ua, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and implemented by a joint venture between NIRAS and BBC Media Action, as well as Ukraine Media Project, managed by Internews and funded by the United States Agency for International Development.

Both pilots are believed to have ejected.\n\nMeanwhile Nato last night said it had seen evidence of weapons being moved into Ukraine from Russia since the downing of MH17.\n\n“We continue to see evidence of the movement of weapons into Ukraine from Russia since the downing of MH17, which is a cause for concern,” the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nRebel leaders have previously denied shooting down Flight MH17, claiming that the surface-to-air missile systems in their possession would have been unable to reach the airliner’s cruising altitude of 33,000 feet.\n\nHowever, the US says it has intelligence suggesting the rebels had sophisticated SA-11 surface-to-air missiles mounted on Buk mobile rocket-launchers, capable of downing an airliner, in the area when Flight MH17 crashed last Thursday.\n\nOne rebel commander appeared to confirm the American assessment, telling Reuters that the rebels did have at least one Buk launcher at the time of the crash.\n\nAlexander Khodakovsky, commander of the Vostok battalion, one of the most powerful armed groups in the rebel army, said at least one Buk, possibly originating in Russia, had entered the area under the colours of the Luhansk People’s Republic, one of two breakaway states declared by the pro-Russian rebels.\n\n“That Buk I know about. I heard about it. I think they sent it back. I found out about it at exactly the moment that I found out that this tragedy had taken place. They probably sent it back in order to remove proof of its presence,” Khodakovsky reportedly said.\n\nHe went on to blame Kiev for provoking the tragedy, claiming that the Ukrainians knew about the presence of the Buk and provoked the attack by launching air strikes just as MH17 was flying overhead.\n\n“It not only did nothing to protect security, but provoked the use of this type of weapon against a plane that was flying with peaceful civilians,” he said.\n\nRussian media later said Khodakovsky had denied making such claims. “I did not say anything of the sort that Reuters reported, and I have a recording of the conversation,” Russia’s RIA Novosti state news agency reported.",

celebrate as if the ukrainian election was its mission accomplished but his understanding of the situation in ukraine and his solutions sadly lacking he thinks the key is negotiating with the russialed separatists who focused purpose is destabilization and nowhere does he even recognize crimea as an ongoing issue such is much of the elite thinking about ukraine in the west ukraine and –

aksvonov who unable to win anything by standing for election became makebelieve prime minister as part of putins illegal seizure of crimea ram threatened pricehiking retailers on the peninsula with coercive measures and canceled licenses addressing all these who do not understand the easy way at a meeting of the illegal crimean council of ministers on monday aksyonov was quoted by interfax as saying there will be coercive measures right up to license removals we do not plan to negotiate with any speculators or retailers who extort money from people oh my aksvonov is ok with illegal invasions but outraged it has led to inflation such is the state of mind of the ignorant and greedy ram since russia annexed crimea from ukraine in march the price of many goods has doubled the head of crimeas trade union federation vladimir klychnikov told interfax aksyonov said retailers of food and medicines would be first in line for authorities attention kyiv post russia luhansk events prove that kyiv doesnt want to seek ways of restoring national accord june 2 2014 922 pm ukraine — by interfaxukraine russian foreign ministry released a statement saying lugansk events proved that kyiv doesnt want to seek ways of restoring national accord moscow – the deadly air strike on the luhansk regional state administration building in which civilians were killed is a flagrant violation of the geneva agreements and of the roadmap proposed by switzerland as the country holding the rotating presidency of the organization for security and cooperation in europe the russian foreign ministry said in a statement posted on its web site globalpost dan peleschuk june 1 2014 1339 things are getting even weirder in the peoples republic of donetsk reporters notebook the tides are changing in the already bizarre fake state donetsk ukraine — it wasnt always this way gaining entry into the towering regional administration here — seized nearly two months ago by local prorussian separatists it does get tiresome debunking the silliness of calling these people prorussian separatists oh sure by now there are disgruntled and misguided ukrainians involved but the entire conflict and continuing control is in the hands of russians who invaded ukraine for the purpose of destabilizing the country – russian pros not prorussians ram and converted into their barricaded trashstrewn headquarters — was fairly difficult grubby leatherskinned men with blunt weaponry would stop prospective visitors cold sometimes denying entry even after being presented with official press credentials but last friday a day after a heavily armed largely foreign fighting unit called the vostok battalion seized the premises and chased out many of its typically ragged inhabitants few of the men at the door seemed to put up a fight flashing press passes granted by the peoples republic of donetsk reporters shuffled through easily almost too easily thats probably because a day earlier something of an elaborate show had kicked off partly aimed at casting this diplomatic nomansland in a more disciplined and orderly — if not exactly wholesome — light for weeks the hulking administration building its façade obscured by junkyard barricades of tires wood planks and barbed wire was home to the disenfranchised largely bluecollar masses thatd driven the protest movement here but to whatever extent the masses which all polling show to be in the minority were involved it remains a fact that the whole criminal enterprise is the doing of russians ram inside the sovietera monolith the corridors were scattered with broken furniture and festooned with antikyiv slogans and crude denouncements of both ukrainian and western leaders the repulsive stench of sweat and trash wafted throughout it was the separatists answer to the sprawling barricades and tent encampments of maidan the nerve center of the monthslong antigovernment protests in kyiv but those days were apparently over on thursday the vostok battalion fighters appeared — masked and heavy weapons drawn — and cleared most of them out of the building within hours a move leaders said was aimed at rooting out looters and other ruffians that had plagued their ranks criminal cleansing ram that evening rebel authorities invited journalists inside offering what they said was proof of their former comrades misdeeds reportedly water bottles cigarettes and small snacks all looted from a local supermarket as the battle for the airport raged on nearby it was apparent that there needed to be a firm crackdown said alexander a security guard for the rebel leadership told globalpost during a visit to the building the following day no longer he added would it be acceptable for protesters to roam around in masks with baseball bats the building alexander went on would now serve strictly as a government headquarters not a hang out spot for unwashed protesters a sense of discipline and efficiency — as far as lawless quasistates go at least — was apparently descending on the peoples republic of donetsk rebel leaders particularly alexander borodai the prime minister of the republic were forced to deny speculation that the buildings takeover by the vostok battalion — comprised mostly of fighters from around russia including chechens — amounted to an armed power grab they instead pitched it as a police operation several vostok members in plain clothes were spotted inside the administration building the day after the takeover borodai a muscovite appears in control of both the vostok fighters —some of which serve as his bodyguards — and increasingly of the republic itself he cuts the image of a warlord but one whose strategy and intentions are difficult to read one night earlier this week as he dined with associates in a hotel restaurant chock full of western reporters his aide — a lanky and bearded man named sergei — was dispatched across the room to extend reporters an offer few couldve refused that was to accompany a rebel caravan as it escorted more than 30 dead russian fighters killed in last weeks botched attack on the airport here from a local hospital morgue and across the border to be buried on their motherland not only was it the first open admission by the rebel leadership here that foreign fighters have played a key role in the insurgency but it was a somewhat unusual display of openness much of the press hadnt seen before outside the morgue the following day hordes of journalists flocked around the rows of red coffins that lay stacked on the lawn unsure of the rebels game plan meanwhile borodai and another top rebel leader denis pushilin made their rounds and fielded questions from the press but as time went on — at some point a shorttempered thug threatened to shoot reporters who wouldnt step away from the loading zone — a rumor briefly circulated that the bodies were actually already inside the coffins sitting under the sweltering sun for at least an hour that was quickly debunked however after the fifth or sixth casket was loaded onto a white cargo truck it was clear by the way the men were loading them — like onehanded while talking on a cell phone — they were empty the bodies it turns out were actually being held at a rebelcontrolled ice cream factory outside of town space at the morgue had apparently run out but amid the confusion the rebel leaders spoke openly about their dead comrades russian origins while at least one living vostok member spoke openly about how hed traveled to ukraine in order to help fend off the militarys antiterrorist operation — even about the 100perweek food allowance he received for it it was about this time that the vostok battalion staged its brazen siege on the administration building across town by the time the bodies were well on their way to the russian border the barricades around the building had begun coming down — and in full view of the media most of which had rushed over to catch a glimpse rather than join the convoy many were uncertain would make it it did to observers it is becoming increasingly clear that the affairs of the peoples republic of donetsk are being closely choreographed while a new order much different from the ragged protesters of the past is settling in the problem is no one quite knows yet who the show is for one thing however is certain for many ordinary ukrainians —unaccustomed to guerillastyle insurgencies raging in their front yard — it is anything but a spectacle artyom an 18yearold university student in donetsk told globalpost that armed gunmen had stormed his dormitory building the same day as vostok fighters commandeered the regional administration demanding to see proof of the students registration there for artyom a first year philology student at a local university who asked that his name be changed for fears of his personal safety the fear is nothing new an active proukraine protester he was been beaten earlier this spring and even briefly kidnapped by prorussian thugs allegedly for wearing a lapel pin featuring ukraines coat of arms but the conflict has also hit home for him on a recent evening he was scouring the premises of the rebel headquarters searching for his father whod taken up arms behind the barricades even before hed lost contact with him — about two weeks ago — their relations were strained now he says despite their fundamental differences he wants to find his father before fighting breaks out again in donetsk i never wouldve thought that this sort of situation could unfold in ukraine he said in russianruled crimea a crackdown on journalists and activists who dont toe kremlin line june 1 2014 844 am ukraine — by kyiv post russias prime minister dmitry medvedev r waves as he walks in the crimean port of sevastopol on may 25 with minister for crimean affairs oleg savelyev c and putins envoy to crimea oleg belaventsev l accompanying medvedev independent journalists and civic activists have had an increasingly difficult time working in ukraine russias law enforcement agency has arrested at least four activists suspected of terrorism advocates for the suspects say the accusations are false and meant to intimidate those who dont agree with the kremlins illegal occupation of crimea © afp simferopol crimea the entrance to the simferopol trade union building which stands opposite the cabinet of ministers on lenin square has been obstructed daily by members of socalled crimean selfdefense militias since march these men dressed in camouflage and armed with police batons and sometimes guns wander into the building freely where their frequent destination is the office of the center for investigative journalism weve all come across them says journalist tatiana kurmanova wearily they make no concrete demands they just have the effect of scaring us – imagine the first time when they came in here with pistols looking at everything the center financed through grants from the us agency for international development and other foreign donors was one of the first media organizations to receive such unwanted attention in russiacontrolled crimea if russian president vladimir putin remains in control of ukraines peninsula and follows the same policy for crimea that he does with the rest of the russian federation then foreignfunded projects in particular those with usaid funding will be targets for shutdown the crimean selfdefense members marched into the journalism centers office on march 1 two days after soldiers without insignia appeared throughout the peninsula and set in motion the russian invasion and occupation or – as russian law would have it annexation of crimea the selfdefense militias ungoverned by any law have since become a permanent fixture of daily life in crimea patrolling streets guarding transport hubs and government buildings demanding to see the documents of passersby – and harassing journalists while attacks on media have abated somewhat since march when the center for investigative journalism recorded 85 incidents crimea has by no means become a safe place for journalists oleg sentsov was arrested earlier this month in crimea where the human rights situation is rapidly deteriorating and now hes been charged by russia with planning a terrorist attackrussias federal security service has accused sentsov of being a member of ukrainian rightwing group pravey sector adding that he was in possession of explosives firearms and nationalist paraphernalia the german film group funding sentsovs project says the filmmakers only crime was that he opposed russias annexation of crimea in the last six weeks andrey krisko who heads the crimean human rights field mission has registered nine serious incidents of harassment of journalists involving personal harm damage to equipment and illegal detention for more than three hours he experienced one such incident himself when he was physically prevented from taking pictures of a journalist arguing with selfdefense forces on may 17 later he found out the journalist had been followed and detained most cases krisko said concern not single but groups of journalists and all cases involve the selfdefense militias some cases have been widely publicized like that of journalist osman pashayev on may 18 pashayev was filming the crimean tatar meeting commemorating 70 years of their deportation and the hundreds of riot police guarding simferopol city center when selfdefense forces detained both him and his turkish cameraman they were held for 10 hours had all their equipment taken away and were denied access to lawyers until a threatened appeal to the prosecutors office kurmanova thinks there are probably many more such incidents involving the selfdefense and russian federal security service or fsb under its russian acronym but journalists working for crimean government media do not want to publicize them most of the journalists who have spoken publicly like pashayev left crimea afterwards as soon as they could meanwhile several crimean civil activists who supported the euromaidan revolution that ousted president viktor yanukovych on feb 22 and protested against russian occupation are currently detained by the fsb the fsb said on may 30 that film director oleg sentsov alexandr kolchenko oleksiy chyrniy and hennadiy afanasyev are under arrest charged with being members of ukraines ultranationalistic right sector and suspected of plotting to stage acts of sabotage and terrorist attacks in several cities of the peninsula kateryna serhatskova a journalist and coordinator of an initiative group to help sentsov says sentsov kolchenko chyrniy and afanasyev have never been members of right sector for those who have doubts these guys have never been members of the right sector and prepared no terrorist attacks these are absolutely peaceful people who maintained the integrity of ukraine now confessions are being forced out of them and probably one of them will admit his guilt all in all its outrageous nonsense no comment serhatskova wrote on her facebook page on may 30 according to interfaxukraine news service the whereabouts of two more activists timur shaimardanov and leonid korzh reported missing by the ukrainian organisation ukrainian house on may 28 are unknown the effect of this intimidation has been to effectively silence critical or opposition media to the russian annexation within crimea tv channel atr and the website 15 minutes both owned by crimean tatar businessman lenur islyamov have greatly cut down on their live programming and news coverage since march the only other independent agencies left the center for investigative journalism and the radio libertysupported project crimean reality both have regular problems with the selfdefense militias this situation when there are these groups that dont answer to anyone that arent controlled by any law means its impossible to say journalists can work professionally here says krisko the risk of damage to equipment or personal attacks as well as fear of censorship means that those who want to give objective information simply cant in methods reminiscent of soviet tactics smear campaigns censorship and simple exclusion by news sources are also silencing journalists who might want to show a less onesided prorussian view of current affairs in crimea kurmanova and her colleagues regularly receive online threats and hate mail since the beginning of march meanwhile two journalists from the yevpatoria councilfunded newspaper yevpatoria health resort who had been less than enthusiastic about russian occupation became subject to an attempted witch hunt in may when rival journalists sent a letter accusing them of being spies and provocateurs to the city council we dont demand the exile of these people from their town and their profession according to the letter but we yevpatorians do not need these masked fifth columnists in our hometown and paid from the town budget it concludes by saying that if the town council does not remove them from the paper we will appeal to the fsb demanding they protect us russian citizens from journalists openly conducting subversive activities the two journalists have so far held on to their jobs and did not want to comment further on the incident since the end of february when a new crimean parliament was announced journalists from the center for investigative journalism have not been able to get parliamentary accreditation lawmakers refuse to speak to them or call them american spies the crimean cabinet of ministers press service does not answer their calls they are not informed of meetings and press conferences or are denied entry theres a very clear difference between journalists from russian media who can get into the offices of officials and anywhere else with no problem and journalists from ukrainian media who might ask awkward questions says kurmanova were like white crows no one wants to talk to us before it was all organised we could write a request for information or set up filming now we get our information in bits and pieces grabbing officials outside buildings if they agree to speak shevket ganiyev editorinchief of crimean tatar programming at the crimean state broadcasting company trk was excluded from news coverage through a different method he and his director were simply sent home for a months holiday ganiyevs small amount of allotted live broadcasting had already been taken off air with no warning in march before a hastilyorganised referendum on joining crimea to russia ganiyev and his colleagues who like most crimean tatars openly opposed the referendum then agreed with trk management which openly supported it that his department would boycott working at trk until after the referendum when his team came back on air they were subject to much closer control on april 24 they were told they could not make any mention at all of crimean tatar governing body the mejlis or of crimean tatar leaders mustafa jemilev and refat chubarov in their programming this has meant the editorial has had to ignore events widely covered in the international media – including russian if theres news in russian media and we are not allowed to talk about it how can any journalist accept this as normal asks ganiyev were not just banned from talking about the mejlis as good or bad we are not even allowed to cover facts the same day as the ban ganiyev and the editorial director were asked by trk management to take a months leave of course they didnt say so but i think they had to send us on holiday because then our collective would be easier to control says ganiyev may was a worrying time for them because of the 70th anniversary of the crimean tatar deportation and events connected with that i think they were scared and tried to protect themselves ganiyev was back at work from may 28 but he and his team have no idea what the future will bring amid the general upheaval at trk which was formerly funded by the ukrainian government but is now is a state of stasis for the crimean tatar editorial this is yet another setback in their fight for more airtime in their own language their live airtime was reduced over a year ago to 13 minutes news a day and their recorded programming is exclusively about cultural and social matters were hostages in this situation says ganiyev for us the most important things are to preserve our work places and editorial so that we can broadcast in crimean tatar language if tomorrow they kick us out and bring in new journalists who are convenient for them and who speak in incorrect crimean tatar theyll be pleased because it will start the assimilation of our language under the ukrainian license still being used at trk crimean tatar language is allotted seven percent of overall airtime ukrainian language programming before march was even more limited since march one of just three weekly ukrainian language programmes has switched to russian svetlana datsenko editor of one of the two remaining ukrainian programmes said she had also been asked to switch to russian if there are three equal state languages in crimea then there should be proportional coverage 33 percent for each language ganiyev points out but neither he nor datsenko have much expectation of that happening the new head of trk boris nemets is from crimean government head sergei aksyonovs russian unity party as is the new crimean minister for information the partys key campaigning platform is russian language rights as crimea moves rapidly towards adopting russian legislation the situation for a free media is only set to get worse on top of harassment and exclusion staff of the center for investigative journalism have a whole array of logistical problems to deal with their salaries paid from foreign donors are frozen as the crimean banking system has collapsed they have been told to vacate their rented offices by the end of july russian legislation which comes into force in crimea in january requires that their organisation register as a foreign agent and completely bans their main donor usaid increasingly repressive russian laws can shut down opposition websites and impose prison sentences on anyone questioning russian territorial integrity which would include crimea in the media meanwhile a law legalizing the selfdefense militias has already passed its first reading in the crimean parliament according to kurmanova it grants the militias a wide range of powers to stop search confiscate and detain with minimum responsibilities as state media in crimea produces a soothing stream of information about a bright russian future ignoring the economic and social problems since annexation and downplaying or disregarding nonrussian ethnic groups it is little surprise that kurmanova and datsenko from trk both plan to leave crimea for mainland ukraine by the end of the summer we had strict editorial standards and i suppose thats why its hardest of all for us because now no one here needs such editorial standards says kurmanova its easier just not to ask questions and to keep quiet editors note this article has been produced with support from wwwmymediaorgua funded by the ministry of foreign affairs of denmark and implemented by a joint venture

the group of companies ukragrocom hermestrading has continued its successful work on the international markets and expanding its range of available financial instruments more and more projects have been realized related to the attraction of direct financing from international financial institutions the advantages are obvious – lower cost and longer payoff periods it is well known that

process of attracting direct export financing from the exportimport bank of the united states exim bank the group of companies ukragrocom hermestrading decided to work actively in that direction

30 2014 – 0407 pm with the help of news services like rt and ruptly the kremlin is seeking to reshape the way the world thinks about russia and it has been highly successful vladimir putin has won the propaganda war over ukraine and the west is divided ivan rodionov sits in his office at berlins postdamer platz and seems to relish his role as the bad guy he rails in almost accentfree german with a quiet but sharp voice on the german media which he claims have been walking in lockstep when it comes to their coverage of the ukraine crisis during recent appearances on two major german talk shows rodionov disputed allegations that russian soldiers had infiltrated crimea prior to the controversial referendum and its annexation by russia he says its the radical rightwing views of the kiev government and not russia that poses the threat western politicians he says are either helping directly or are at least looking on rodionov defends president vladimir putin so vehemently that one could be forgiven for confusing him with a kremlin spokesperson but rodionov views himself as a journalist the 49yearold is the head of the video news agency ruptly founded one year ago and financed by the russian government the eighth floor of the office building has a grand view of germanys house of parliament the reichstag its a posh location and the kremlin doesnt seem to mind spending quite a bit of money to disseminate its view of the world from here around 110 people from spain britain russia and poland work day and night in the threefloor office space on videos that are then syndicated to the international media at first glance its not obvious that ruptly is actually kremlin tv in addition to putin speeches there are also numerous other video clips available in its archive ranging from pussy riot to arrests of members of the russian opposition when it comes to eastern ukraine however the agency offers almost exclusively videos that are favorable towards prorussian supporters of the peoples republic of donetsk which was founded by separatists youll also find rightwing radicals like britains nick griffin or german farright extremist olaf rose an ideologist with the neonazi national democratic party npd stirring up hatred towards the european union and its ukraine policies propagating the kremlins position rodionov says that since its founding ruptly has attracted 14 subscribers and over 200 customers including german broadcasters both public and private subsidies from moscow enable ruptly to offer professionally produced videos at prices cheaper than those of the private competition the battle over ukraine is being fought with diverse means with harsh words and soft diplomacy with natural gas weapons and intelligence services but perhaps the most important instruments being deployed by moscow are the internet newspapers and television including allegedly neutral journalists and pundits dispatched around the world to propagate the kremlin position were in the middle of a relentless propaganda war says andrew weiss vice president of studies at the carnegie endowment for international peace an influential washington think tank weiss describes this propaganda as a crucial tool used by russia to conduct its foreign policy moscow is looking beyond the shortterm seeking to influence opinion in the longrun to create an alternative discourse in western countries as well says margarita simonyan editor in chief of kremlin foreign broadcaster rt formerly known as russia today which owns ruptly the kremlin invests around €100 million 136 million a year in russian media abroad in order to influence public opinion in the west this effort also helps explain why putin addressed germans directly in his speech on the annexation of crimea noting the kremlin had supported germanys reunification process he called on germans to back russias reunification with crimea putins popularity in germany has declined steadily over the years but his worldview remains quite popular a triumphant media advance sources within the kremlin express satisfaction these days when talking about moscows information policies we may have won the war in georgia in 2008 but we lost the propaganda battle against america and the west by a mile says one thanks to rt and the internet though we are now closing the gap whereas ruptly is seeking to establish itself as an alternative to reuters and the associated press in providing video footage rt has already successfully established itself in the nine years since its creation recently surpassing even cnn when it comes to clips viewed on youtube with close to 12 billion views the bbc is the only media outlet ahead of rt in britain rt has more viewers than the europewide news station euronews and in some major us cities the channel is the mostviewed of all foreign broadcasters rts 2500 employees report and broadcast in russian english spanish and arabic with german to be added soon the triumphant advance of putins broadcaster began in a former factory in northeast moscow founding rt editor simonyan was just 25 at the time putin appointed her in 2005 her assignment from the russian president to break the monopoly of the anglosaxon mass media its a mandate she has been pursuing successfully ever since theres large demand for media that doesnt just parrot the uniform pulp from the western press says simonyan even in western countries rt gives prorussian representatives from eastern ukraine far more air time than supporters of the government in kiev and not even simonyan disputes this fact were something along the lines of russias information defense ministry her coworkers say not without pride ruptly and rt are only the most visible instruments being used by the kremlin other propaganda methods being exploited can be less obvious for example when german talk shows invite russian journalists to speak about the ukraine crisis they are almost always pundits who could have been taken directly out of the kremlin propaganda department programmers of course like to book these guests because they generate heated and provocative discussion but its also a function of the fact that experts critical of the government either dont want to talk or are kept from doing so take the example of sergej sumlenny who served until january as the german correspondent for the russian business magazine expert early on he appeared often on german talk shows intelligently and pointedly criticizing putins policies he has since been driven out at the magazine in his stead the russian perspective is now represented on german talk shows by people like anna rose who is generally introduced as a correspondent for rossiyskaya gazeta or russian gazette the name sounds innocuous enough but eyebrows should be raised immediately when this serious russian journalist begins claiming that the ukrainian army could be shooting at women and children and that russian soldiers need to provide them with protection her positions suddenly become more understandable with the knowledge that rossiyskaya gazeta is the russian governments official newspaper manipulating comments and social media those who read comments posted under articles about ukraine on news websites will have noticed in recent months that they have been filled with missives that always seem to follow the same line of argumentation moscows independent business daily vedomosti reported recently that since the start of the ukraine crisis the presidential administration in moscow has been testing how public opinion in the united states and europe can be manipulated using the internet and social networks the paper reported that most of the professional comment posters active in germany are russian immigrants who submit their prorussian comments on facebook and on news websites in addition journalists and editors at german websites and publications report receiving letters and emails offering explosive information about the ukraine crisis on an almost daily basis the sources often mention they have evidence about the rightwing nature of the kiev government that they would like to supply to journalists the letters are written in german but appear to include direct translations of russian phrases they would seem to have been written by mothertongue russian speakers other forms of propaganda have also been deployed in recent months for example there have been frequent incidences of intercepted conversations of western diplomats or kiev politicians getting published in ways that serve russias interests from the fuck the eu statement by victoria nuland the top us diplomat to europe right up to statements made by estonias foreign minister that were apparently supposed to prove who was responsible for the deaths of protesters on maidan square the russian media also seemed to take pleasure in reporting in midapril that cia head john brennan had traveled to kiev theres a high likelihood that this confidential information and the content of intercepted communications is being strewn by russian intelligence officials at western intelligence agencies assume that even communications encrypted by the ukrainian army are being intercepted by the russians part 2 the west has never gotten over putins return the kremlin also deftly exploits the antiamerican sentiment of many western europeans by claiming for example that american mercenaries and consultants have been deployed in eastern ukraine even today there is still no evidence to back any of these allegations but americas credibility isnt helped by the fact that washington also disseminates its own antirussian propaganda backed by the drumbeat of conservative fox news republic senator john mccain has been loudly calling on the us government to provide prowestern forces with active aid including weapons meanwhile forbes magazine has asked is putin a new hitler in addition washingtons development agency usaid announced at the start of may it would provide 125 million in support to ukrainian media organizations as they prepared for presidential elections washington has long provided support for a network of opposition groups who were active during the orange revolution and are now mobilizing against moscow a media center established by the new government in kievs hotel ukraina has been partly financed by george soros international renaissance foundation day in and day out reporters are airing interviews with ministers and loyal political scientists who interpret events in eastern ukraine the way the kiev government would like to see them portrayed still moscows efforts present a stark contrast to the activities of independent european media companies many newspapers and broadcasters have scaled back their bureaus in moscow or closed them altogether in recent years this has created a shortage of experts who can penetrate the propaganda coming from all sides and provide honest analysis of what is actually happening the fact that the brainwashing seems to be working could be evidenced last monday when german foreign minister frankwalter steinmeier made an appearance in the runup to elections for the european parliament on berlins alexanderplatz square leftwing activists shouted and booed at the foreign minister and held up signs stating stop the nazis in ukraine moscow registered the protest with satisfaction and the kremlinaligned media reported on it extensively russias greatest propaganda success the purpose of this global battle to shape opinion isnt merely to transform europeans and americans into fans of vladimir putin the russian president is also targeting his own people seeking to make himself unassailable within russia putins greatest propaganda success is the fact that the majority of russians now believe that kiev is ruled by fascists evoking world war ii in this way has proven very effective with russians one member of russias parliament the duma even went so far as to call the fire in odessa that killed 30 prorussia activists a new auschwitz meanwhile the head of parliament spoke of genocide in ukraine with the spin machine at full steam it is perhaps of little surprise that a radio poll recently found that 89 percent of listeners agreed with the idea that the participants of the mass murder in odessa should be found and executed without trial journalists with the russian state media often like to quote german politicians and experts unfortunately they always seem to pick from the same pack of pundits one is putin biographer alexander rahr formerly a russia specialist at the german council on foreign relations dgap and today a consultant with the gas firm wintershall which has deep ties with russia the west has never gotten over putins return rahr says in explaining germanys position toward the kremlin he also claims that german politicians private beliefs are different from their public statements they are he says only able to express themselves openly about russia once they have left office the kremlin seizes control a critical analysis of such statements has been lacking one reason is that in recent months the kremlin has begun tightening control over russianlanguage internet media in order to keep the home front from wavering russian investigative journalist and security services expert andrei soldatov says that kremlinaligned youth organizations are assisting the government in posting blogs and attacking moscows critics most broadcasters and newspapers are already under the kremlins control some 94 percent of russians obtain their information primarily from state television the problem is that state tv has no qualms about blatantly fabricating the news two weeks ago for example the evening news showed video allegedly depicting the murder of a prorussian fighter in eastern ukraine by nationalists in fact the video used was actually one and a half years old and showed fighters in the north caucasus few have studied the effects of that kind of propaganda as much as lev gudkov the head of independent moscow pollster levada the institution recently had to undergo yet another government review the public prosecutor openly admitted to us that the only reason we havent been closed yet is that the kremlin hasnt given the final order to shut us down says gudkov but we are certainly being harassed the 67yearold research pulls out one poll after another from a stack of papers they show that when the mass protests against president viktor yanukovych broke out only 30 percent of russians believed that ukraines association agreement with the eu was a betrayal of slavic unity in february at the peak of the maidan protests 73 percent still considered the issue to be an internal one for ukrainians in the time that has transpired since some 58 percent of russians now support the annexation of eastern ukraine by russia the successful propaganda campaign we are witnessing here surrounding the ukraine crisis is unique and highly sophisticated even compared to soviet standards says gudkov the kremlin has succeeded in stirring up sentiments deeply rooted in the russian psyche the yearning for an imperial grandness a sense of antiamericanism and pride over russias victory over hitlers germany ultimately it was the annexation of crimea that silenced putins critics prior to the development dissatisfaction with putin had been growing continuously polls showed an increasing number of russians wanted to vote the president out of office in november 2013 53 percent said they would vote for a different candidate during the next election but putin experienced a meteoric rise in popularity after the annexation with 86 percent of russians now saying they would reelect him by moritz gathmann christian neef matthias schepp and holger stark translated from the german by daryl lindsey opinion the new york times ukraines festering divisions by samuel charap june 2 2014 washington — as the polls closed during last months snap presidential elections in ukraine violence broke out in the east of the country insurgents took over donetsk airport and the government responded with airstrikes eastern ukraine has become a breeding ground for an armed insurgency and if a comprehensive political settlement isnt reached soon ukraine could descend into outright civil conflict western governments should make working with the ukrainian authorities to pursue such an arrangement their top priority until now the west has prioritized holding a free and fair presidential election and is now celebrating a mission accomplished as a senior american official put it it was a spectacular day for the people of ukraine who went out in force to choose a new president and to say to their government and to the world that they want a future that is unified that is democratic that is prosperous and that is rooted in europe without question having a legitimate head of state is a positive development — all the more so since the presidentelect the oligarch petro poroshenko won over 50 percent of the vote and therefore avoided a secondround runoff always divisive in ukraine for the first time since 1991 but western pronouncements particularly americas have misleadingly portrayed the violence as merely an unfortunate backdrop to otherwise successful elections not as a symptom of an emerging rupture in the ukrainian polity that could have profound consequences while noting the difficulties of voting in donetsk and neighboring lugansk and praising the courage and determination of those who worked the polling stations there a statement from secretary of state john kerry on the election did not even condemn the bloodshed even though the death count in fierce battles between the ukrainian military backed by the newly formed and poorly trained national guard and armed insurgents had already reached triple digits any government has the right to assert its writ on its own sovereign territory but this antiterrorist operation is being conducted in regions where the population was already overwhelmingly opposed to the government in kiev sic kyiv a midapril poll found that over 70 percent of the population in both donetsk and lugansk consider that government illegal a separate survey indicated that 80 percent believe it does not represent all of ukraine the governments assault on these regions has almost certainly hardened these views as the russian governments first war in chechnya or the turkish governments campaign against kurdish separatists demonstrate counterterrorism missions can be deeply counterproductive when the civilian population has as much or more sympathy for the alleged terrorists than it does for the military doing battle with them of course there is a difference between the view that the interim government was illegal and did not represent eastern ukraine and believing the same thing after the election there is also a much published – even in the times – difference between feeling the interim government was illegitimate and wanting to separate from ukraine – overwhelming majority wishes ukraine to stay together ram the ukrainian government and its western partners need to focus on three priorities that would do far more to stabilize and unite ukraine than the recent presidential poll an end to the antiterrorist operation and a goodfaith attempt at a negotiated settlement with separatists in the east formation of a more inclusive government and constitutional reform that decentralizes power strange – maybe obamas negotiating with the taliban is setting a new standard – but why should poroshenko negotiate with socalled separatists who are led by russians who have infiltrated ukraine for the expressed purpose of destabilizing the country likewise why does ukraine need to be told to have a more inclusive government and to decentralize power both general objectives of the interim and new government and indeed directions ukraine was going before yanukovych and his cronies pushed ukrainian governance to new levels of corruption ram rather than escalate the assault on the insurgents thus ensuring more killing of ukrainians by ukrainians the government in kiev needs to halt it and make a goodfaith highprofile effort at a negotiated solution the crackdown should resume only if the government can credibly demonstrate to the local population that the separatists refuse to accept a reasonable compromise second the ukrainian government must bring regional balance to a government that is currently dominated by representatives from western ukraine about twothirds of ministeriallevel and higher portfolios have gone to those regions which represent only 12 percent of the population the presidential elections demonstrated that the cabinet is not only regionally skewed its also politically unrepresentative the farright svoboda party whose leader got less than 2 percent of the vote has a third of the senior portfolios some of these should be allocated to southerners and easterners finally the constitutional reform package currently being negotiated and debated could transform ukraines diversity into a source of strength the drafting process must be treated as a top priority by the ukrainian government and its western partners the country desperately needs a decentralized political system so that no ukrainian feels that his or her way of life is threatened by a change in power in kiev that can only happen through empowering regional governments with direct elections and far greater authority for decisionmaking on matters other than foreign and defense policy unfortunately the current draft constitutional amendments dont allow for direct election of governors at the same time the ukrainian government must avoid policies that aggravate regional divisions unfortunately the united states and the european union appear poised to assist kiev in doing precisely that by pushing ahead with ukraines rapid institutional integration into the west this agenda continues to be highly divisive in ukraine when asked in midapril about which political and economic orientation — russia europe or both — would be better for the country ukrainians were divided in the west 82 percent preferred europe only 2 percent preferred russia and 9 percent favored both while in the east only 16 percent preferred europe versus 46 percent for russia and 26 percent for both ukraines presidential election was a positive step but it has not come close to resolving the countrys multifaceted crisis or bridging its deep regional divides it would be a strategic error for western policy makers to softpedal the other far more important steps needed to unify ukraine or to drive an agenda that pulls it further apart samuel charap is senior fellow

nezalezhnosti in december part of the threemonth protest that brought down the kremlindependent government of president viktor yanukovych cc license lets consider for a moment what has worked and not worked in ukraines fight for freedom from russian domination what worked was the maidan – the massive determined and almost completely nonviolent protest movement that overthrew the corrupt kremlindependent president viktor yanukovych what has not worked has been the ukrainian governments patchwork counterinsurgency offensive against kremlinbacked separatist militias in southeast ukraine i accept the point rupert is making but cringe at the common quickie of a description of what the maidan did overthrew yanukovych – yes in the end i suppose it did but more accurately it demanded reforms in the outrageously corrupt government of yanukovych reforms he in the end was unwilling to make and when us sanctions began to be applied against many of his insiders they fled and with that he then abandoned his post and his responsibilities and also fled it takes longer to say or write even this summary but it is much more accurate and the additional facts are important to history and understanding the present ram in the current battle for the southeast ukraines mix of government forces – army units national guardsmen and provinciallevel militias raised by local business magnates – has proven barely able to establish security perimeters around the towns and cities held by russian backed and russian staffed ram secessionist militias if any policeandmilitary machine exists in the world with the specialized training weapons intelligence and communications to wade into ukraines southeastern provinces and surgically excise the disparate separatist militias without hurting local civilians it doesnt exist in ukraine – and it wont be built there anytime soon thats a big reason why a number of policy specialists are now arguing that ukraine with the help of its international supporters should lead its fight against russian subversion in its donbas donetsk basin region with the maidan more precisely with nonviolent civil resistance as policymakers in kyiv washington and european capitals focus on economic sanctions against russia or the proper nato posture in eastern europe is there actual evidence that anyone in the west is actually focusing on sanctions really ram they have given virtually no attention to the seemingly fuzzier notion of encouraging civil resistance movements against russian forces in donbas or crimea thats a mistake according to maciej bartkowski and maria stephan two policy specialists writing this week on the atlantic councils website arguably ukraine and its friends does it have genuine friends that are governments ram should be working hard to build a civil noncooperation movement for these reasons · it works faster and better than guerrilla warfare historically nonviolent civil resistance against violent state opponents has been twice as effective as armed struggle in 323 conflicts from 1900 to 2006 according to research published in 2011 by stephan an atlantic council nonresident fellow and coauthor erica chenoweth even better civil resistance – which relies on nonviolent tactics including consumer boycotts worker strikes political satire protests and parallel institutions – is faster needing on average two and a half years to run its course compared to nine years for violent resistance · the ukrainians are good at it the ukrainians have a great history of using nonviolent resistance – in the orange revolution in 2004 and this year on the maidan bartkowski said in an interview as did the united states during its civil rights movement of the 1960s ukraine has created a certain culture of nonviolent struggle that it now can build upon he said · it can happen even outside of kyiv even in the southeast as a matter of survival local communities near the battle in donbas have autonomously taken steps toward nonviolent resistance the southern city of mykolayiv gathered its local leaders of the maidan movement and the antimaidan opposition to organize a set of joint street patrols and checkpoints to keep armed groups out of town and they set up a local information center to check out and quash the panicked rumors and disinformation that often have helped destabilize communities facing the threat of militia violence · it will leave ukraine stronger and healthier when its over a nonviolent resistance campaign hews closer to the rule of law and the accountability of the powerful that ukrainians have demanded in protest marches opinion surveys and elections civil resistance will build civil society in regions that long have been subject to governance by secretive combines of state authorities corrupt businesses and organized crime a guerrilla war will build guerrilla forces that after any conflict will have to be disarmed and disbanded how to do it for starters a russianlanguage tv station a civil resistance fight for the future of donbas would limit but not eliminate a role for the security forces the kyiv government and its international supporters should build as quickly as possible the ukrainian militarys ability to seal the countrys border stopping the infiltration of fighters and weapons from russia is a critical first step bartkowski said and the us and european governments could help with training and surveillance technology including unarmed drones once the border is better controlled the military resources should focus on isolating the cities that are dominated by the separatists controlling the roads and establishing a cordon sanitaire to protect adjacent areas from violence bartkowksi said within the areas dominated by the mix of russianbacked militias – local separatist fighters russian military officers russian cossack police auxiliaries and chechen and ossetian guerrillas – ukraine should encourage a campaign of civil resistance starting with lowrisk tactics bartkowski said the civil resistance campaign that helped oust chilean dicator augusto pinochet began in the early 1980s with the lowrisk tactic of cacerolazos in which protesters banged spoons against casserole dishes in their homes to share the sound and their sense of common purpose against the regime a resistance model for donbas might be the czechoslovak noncooperation with soviet soldiers who occupied their country in 1968 to any approach by a soviet soldier a citizens response was 1 dont know 2 dont care 3 dont tell 4 dont have 5 dont know how to etc bartkowski and stephan write a key starting point would be a russianlanguage tv station broadcasting from transmitters in governmentheld territory to break the lack of information for millions of people in donbas which receives only broadcasts by kremlinallied russian channels bartkowski said the maidan needs a mission finally a huge reason and resource for building a civilresistance strategy is this three months after overthrowing the corrupt yanukovych administration maidan activists and their young prodemocratic organizations are looking for ways to sustain their mission thousands of ukrainians gathered at the maidan yesterday in a peoples assembly to discuss this very issue much of the maidans new focus will be the monitoring of the incoming central government of presidentelect petro poroshenko and the new kyiv government of mayorelect vitaliy klitschko but the maidan remains a resource of civic energy and civil resistance that should be tapped not ignored in ukraines fight to remain whole and free james rupert is an editor at the atlantic council european council on foreign relations the ukraine crisis and the wests true problem by volker stanzel 29 may 14 some observers have heaped scorn on the wests seemingly kneejerk reaction to the crisis in ukraine but in fact the wests reaction was not so much a failure as some people think and the west faces problems that would still remain even if it had reacted differently the ukraine problem ukraine still poses a major problem even after the presidential elections of 25 may too many of ukraines politicians have behaved for too long like pilots about to crash heading for a catastrophe and completely paralysed in the face of it when he closed the door on the european union viktor yanukovych knew well that he would run into strong opposition back home but he would not make even the slightest tactical compromise – if he had he might still be in his villa after yanukovych signed the agreement to step down no later than december 2014 the ukrainian parliament gave in to the fury on the maidan and removed the president from office even though it knew that this would represent an intolerable provocation to vladimir putins russia hello the ukrainian parliament removed yanukovych from office – is this guy serious once his key supporters were hit with sanctions because of the violence they perpetrated on the people of maidan they fled and then yanukovych fled his position and responsibilities the parliament then pursuant to the constitution filled the vacancy he created has stanzel been smoking something or is he just that far out of touch ram since taking over the interim leaders have watched the events in eastern ukraine as if hypnotised they have failed to wage a war for the hearts and minds of the people in the region who as polls indicated did not want to become part of russia but were left alone with welltrained thugs and separatists from within and beyond the border and in the end the leaders in kyiv did not know better than to send in troops even at the risk of setting off civil war clever disassociation of the west from the interim governments approach – how about admitting there was significant pressure from the west for what the interim government did and did not do ram however so far the blood that has been spilled is blood on putins hands in germany many people believe that there is too much empathy for russia from the russlandversteher the russia understanders but in a crisis it is important to understand what the situation looks like to the other side in the eyes of putins russia the west is encroaching on russias proper space in an attempt to contain it at the same time russia believes the west is weak because of its dependency on russian energy it is decadent as a civilisation and spineless as a political actor what putin thinks should be of little consequence his paranoia qand his believing in a history he has made up doesnt justify anything he has done or is doing understanding he is a bit wacky in his napoleonic approach but knowing his sickness is one thing conceding there is any merit to it would be wrong ram putins failed gamble on the other hand what has putins russia achieved so far only a single costly strategic advantage achieved by ripping crimea out of ukraine the achievement can be described as costly because russia reneged on its agreement to leave ukraines borders intact in return for ukraine giving up its soviet nuclear stockpile at the end of the cold war putins russia can not be trusted to keep its word this is a potentially serious longterm disadvantage for example who now believes putin when he promises to cooperate with the new president of ukraine putins russia also brought ukraine closer to disintegration in its efforts to prevent it from moving towards the eu or nato this again was achieved at a price the complete disintegration of ukraine – which is not yet out of the question – would mean that the eastern part of ukraine became an economic and political burden for russia the western part would move closer to the eu – which ukraines newlyelected president petro poroshenko has already stated to be his goal – and yes would get closer to some day joining nato as well putin had wanted to raise doubts about natos willingness to abide by its agreements but natos efforts have reassured the eastern members of the alliance that they can rely on nato standing by its obligations you have to be kidding first of all this guy – like so many others who have to be beaten down – concedes crimea second what eastern members of nato really accept the assurances other nato members offer after watching how much good assurances did ukraine ram meanwhile in russia itself western sanctions will have gradual but unstoppable results causing negative economic and psychological effects putin has had to turn to china at a high price this has reminded the russian public just how much their president has isolated the country and damaged its future economic prospects from putins point of view things do not look good he is trying to realise his pet project the eurasian union through economic strength based on energy profits along with strong nationalistic sentiments with religious undertones but this project and this outlook have brought the country for the time being to a dead end does this guy think the people of russia actually get news that shows and explains putins weakness what planet is he living on ram the wests success the situation is not only of putins making the west could not stop russia from meddling violently in ukraine really this is a genuinely stupid statement the sanctions he touts are at best incremental and applied with multiple mixed signals – genuine crippling sanctions would not have allowed putin to operate and he would have had to back off ram but if as indicated by the results of the presidential elections ukraine is moving in a better direction then this is to a large degree the wests success dont pat yourself on your back too hard ram and this success was not easily come by each country had its own reasons for pulling against the others and refusing to take action against russia it should not have been unexpected that the united kingdom was not prepared to rush headlong into comprehensive sanctions against russias financial businesses given that these enterprises are a mainstay of the uks economy it was hardly astonishing that france hesitated to cancel or violate arms contracts with russia which were partly paid already it was even less surprising that countries such as the baltic states slovakia hungary and germany which are heavily dependent on russian energy deliveries should pause before exposing their economies to energy supply crises japan which is finally improving its long troubled relations with russia was clearly not going to be eager to worsen its situation with the united states being far less economically involved with russia it was entirely predictable that it should see things somewhat differently and in consequence be only barely able to keep control of the western coalition the world of wimps not a leader among them ram but this whole situation was the wests problem and noone elses noone else could act not the united nations paralysed by russias veto power and by chinas disinclination to take on international responsibility the brics club remained silent and so did the g20 the west was faced with the first true threat to stability and peace in europe since the end of the cold war and in applying sanctions against russia it managed the threat even if only through awkwardly groping its way this guy acts like it might be over – hello ram the fact that the west managed to present a united front in dealing with russia was not the outcome of leadership nor of obligations nor of tactical alliances instead it was the outcome of necessity this in fact makes the solution – increasingly severe sanctions – more robust in the long term when it was not really expected countries felt bound by democratic values and they took action slowly without knowing where it would end they have made putins russia understand that it will pay a high price if it is to continue along its current path with all their vital economic interests at risk and even in the midst of opportunistic manoeuvring western countries bit the bullet all too often in the public sphere people regret that the west did not consider a military option and just how do you define that defensive weapons to ukraine so it could defend itself would be a good move – a needed move a move not made continues to be a big mistake ram but if it had many more people might have been killed the outcome would have been uncertain and russia would have become an even more incalculable spoiler in the future development of eastern europe if at some point in the future in another crisis the west should consider a military option it would do well to remember the lesson of this crisis levelheadedness – even if only in the absence of other choices – pays the eus collective action problem of course the crisis is far from over tremendous risks remain most of all for ukrainians but while the ukraine elections are encouraging for the wests ability to cope with future problems at the same time the elections for the european parliament present an opportunity to take a more critical view of the eus inner workings during the ukraine crisis the past few months have exposed two serious problems for the eu which have the potential to turn into problems for europes partners too under the lisbon treaty european foreign policy is supposed to evolve out of the work of the european external action service where has the eeas been the major ideas initiatives and concrete measures throughout the ukraine crisis came from member states eu foreign policy emerged from intergovernmental cooperation much as it did before lisbon this kind of process is often necessary if only to integrate parliaments and constituencies back home but the eeas was created to provide impetus to stimulate and to initiate a coherent european foreign policy to convince citizens in the member states why should citizens go out to vote for the european parliament when they do not see the eu taking the lead in times of real crisis a related problem is that of the eu populations diverse views the rightist and populist parties across the region sympathise with putins russia in many ways the common denominator between the different parties is hostility to the eu as a supranational institution these parties have now been elected in greater numbers to the european parliament gaining a quarter of the votes in some countries such as france they are bound to weaken the impression that european unity remains solid even when europes values are under attack the lesson from both the elections held on 25 may is that the eu can achieve success even under tremendous duress – but its ability to do so in the future may be in danger peterson institute on international economics by anders aslund may 27th 2014 1016 am on may 25 petro poroshenko won a convincing victory in the first round of ukraines free and fair presidential elections his election could lead the way to political stability in the face of continued russian military aggression in eastern ukraine but it is not sufficient to achieve that end presidentelect poroshenko a veteran politician and chocolate billionaire needs to dissolve the ukrainian parliament to hold early parliamentary elections this year in line with his election program and statements after his election under current law parliamentary elections are not required until 2017 for at least five reasons the parliament needs to be reelected first the fundamental problem in ukraine is that no clear break with the old communist elite has occurred this is the time to do so and a fresh parliamentary election usually marks a full democratic breakthrough second the current parliament was elected in october 2012 amid rampant fraud it was ukraines least free and fair election since the end of communism in 1991 admittedly the three democratic opposition parties gained 50 percent of the votes in the proportional part of the election while then president viktor yanukovychs party of regions received only 30 percent and the communists 13 percent but yanukovych reduced the democratic advantage first through election rules and then by purchasing and intimidating deputies to join his faction to gain a majority third this parliament is rightly perceived as pervasively corrupt the overwhelming majority of the parliamentarians are there to make money rather than to fulfill their political convictions therefore any anticorruption policy needs to start with cleansing the legislature currently the democratic parties rule with the support of defectors from yanukovychs party which turned against the president after government forces killed protesters earlier this year but these defectors are largely businessmen who want to protect their commercial interests and many of them have already turned against anticorruption policies fourth a new parliament is needed to reflect ukraines latest democratic breakthrough after such a major event many people change their views many politicians discredit themselves while new political stars are born both the alteration of popular sentiment and the rise of new politicians should be represented in the parliament as soon as possible as a consequence party constellations are bound to change fundamentally and a new regime needs to have a functioning and sensible parliament otherwise it can not legislate fifth both ukrainian and international experience prove the need for early parliamentary elections after a democratic breakthrough a key reason for the utter chaos in ukrainian economic policy from 1991 until 1994 was that the country did not dissolve its predemocratic parliament of 1990 but allowed it to linger until 1994 greatly damaging the nation similarly after the orange revolution of 2004–05 the orange leaders did not dissolve parliament instead they focused on the parliamentary elections in march 2006 rather than the immediate needs of the country this mistake must not be repeated a separate cautionary lesson could be drawn from the experience in russia where president boris yeltsin could have dissolved his old predemocratic parliament in november 1991 but failed to do so because he thought he had to deal with the economic crisis first his delay led to the shootout of the white house in moscow the official building of the russian parliament in october 1993 yeltsin had exhausted his options and had no choice but to dissolve the unruly and undemocratic parliament his successor vladimir putin exploited the excessive concentration of power in the presidential administration to bury democracy altogether any country needs at least one major institution of reasonable legitimacy either parliament or president until these presidential elections the ukrainian parliament was the most legitimate but now the president is more so the popular uprisings in egypt and libya show how awful the outcome can be if neither of these institutions is legitimate then authoritarian rule returns as a supposed defense against chaos and anarchy a parliamentary election should take place as soon as possible in september or october this year poroshenko needs to act instantly while he still possesses the full authority of his election victory the later he acts the more concessions to old vested interests he will be forced to make cartoons russia russia window on eurasia moscow patriarchate giving awards to stalinists and antisemites eggert says paul goble staunton june 2 – the moscow patriarchate is sending a dangerous message about its own views and about what russians should think by presenting awards to individuals who are openly stalinist and antisemitic in their views according to konstantin eggert an independent moscow journalist in a comment to kommersantfm on friday eggert said he was shocked by the decision of the russian church hierarchy to present the patriarchal prize in literature to valery ganichev the head of the union of writers of russia and deputy chairman of the russian popular assembly kommersantrudoc2482345 ganichev is notorious for his prostalin and antijewish comments but disturbingly eggert says this is hardly the first such action by the patriarchate patriarch kirill has presented awards to aleksandr prokhanov who has called stalin a new russian saint and to stanislav kunyayev the openly antisemitic editor of nash sovremennik to be sure neither was given the prize for these specific statements or works but the church had to know about them eggert says the same is true about ganichev who from the 1970s has been one of the recognized leaders of the nationalist direction in russian literature and whose works are infused with an antisemitic spirit there can be no doubt about the trend here the journalist says too many of the nominees and laureates of the patriarchal prize with only a few worthy exceptions are united by a fervent love of stalin and just as strong hatred of the jews america and the west in general of democracy and the intelligentsia moreover these honorees are given to conspiracy thinking and to support of horrific foreign leaders like the bestial saddam hussein and milosevic in the past and the cannibalistic dynasty of the kims in north korea today if anyone doubts that he or she should watch prokhanovs televised panegyric to the grotesque north korean dictator prokhanov kunyayev and ganichev have every right to their views and the dissemination of them eggert says let the if they want to long for the stalinist boot and to deny the holocaust but that doesnt mean that the russian orthodox church has any justification for giving them prizes there is no way to combine the expressed values of the church with the expressed views of prokhanov and his like eggert says you must choose either the one or the other the jury of the patriarchal prize has made its choice and patriarch kirill alas has in essence supported it orthodox christians and all others of good will can only be appalled and ashamed window on eurasia putins moves in ukraine pushing russia toward disintegrtion portnikov says paul goble staunton june 2 – by his actions in ukraine and elsewhere vladimir putin is pushing russia toward disintegration vladimir portnikov says indeed he argues the kremlin leader has already taken all the decisions necessary for that to happen and to happen far more quickly than anyone expects in an interview at the end of last week the ukrainian commentator says that it isnt so much that putin has miscalculated although he has not made the best decisions he might have but that the russian president was chosen by history itself to liquidate the state he heads obozrevatelcominterview19627portnikovrossiyaraspadetsyaputinvseneobhodimyieresheniyauzheprinyalhtm in that respect portnikov continues putins elevation was not the most successful choice because he is not a very educated man it is possible that this process would have gone better if russia had a leader who had greater intellectual potential and an understanding of strategic consequences was not so greedy for money and who was not so tied to his entourage but however that may be he continues putin faces a problem that no one could have solved the russian federation is not a state it is a fragment of the former soviet union which unlike other former soviet republics never had real statehood never had its own communit party with the exception of he last two years of the existence of the union and to a large extent was the nucleus of the empire itself russias statehood after 1991 did not undero any changes portnikov says up to now it exists as a quite strange conglomerate consisting of republics oblasts krays and national districts and unresolved national religious and territorial issues connected with the existence of the regions everything has remained soviet and the main thing for the preservation of this territory was to avoid setting precedents which would allow its disintegration boris yeltsin and his advisors understood this but vladimir putin does not the first russian president backed the independence of the rsfsr so that autonomies inside it would have nowhere to go that was the correct decision portnikov says because then in fact tatarstan was at the point of leaving the russian federation as was chechnya indeed the entire existence of the russian federation since then has been based on the soviet status quo of the inviolability of borders indeed the harshness of russia in the chechen war was to a large extent justified by the necessity of observing this status quo and not taking any legal changes which would allow the borders of russia to be changed having recognized the independence of abkhazia and south osetia and even more having carried out the annexation of crimea putin has violated this order of things portnikov continues because he knows very well that if crimea can liberally in the course of a week change its jurisdiction then nothing will prevent declaratons of independence or a change in jurisdiction by tatarstan bashkortostan tuva yakutia buryatiya and kabardiniabalkaria still more fatefully by what he is doing in donetsk and luhansk putin is opening the door for such actions by predominantly russian territories as well crimea could at least be presented as ethnically different but the others and even more novorossiya can not possibly be described that way they thus open a direct path to a urals republic like the one yeltsin worked so hard to suppress to a siberian republic and to all other similar arrangements given putins incautious actions the disintegration of russia will proceed triggered by an economic crisis russia is a territory which is held together exclusively by the common striving of the population to make use of energy resources if that becomes less profitable and possible then the end will be near sanctions may bring that day closer but other factors are at work including massive corruption and diversion of earnings by putin and his entourage into their own pockets the ukrainian analyst says and once this process starts it will move quickly so quickly that those like putin who believe that his deal with china will stop it miss an important detail the moscowbeijing accord goes into effet only in 2018 and today is still 2014 between then and now is four years and much can and will happen history is accelerating in the 19th century people looked forward approximately a hundred years in the early 20th in 50year categories somewhere at the start of the 1970s many experts came to the understanding that the soviet union would not last out the net 2025 years now events are moving faster and people need to think about four or five years out look how fast things have moved in ukraine he says the same thing is going to be true of russia to talk about the chinese contrat which will go into effet only four years from now is simply funny five years from now we will lie in a completely different world in which the russian federation in its current form wont exist moreover the russian federations demise will have enormous consequences for its neighbors because russia is the main generator of instability both for itself and for them according to portnikov moscow will focus on kazakhstan it wont be able to do much while nursultan nazarbayev is in office but no one knows what will be the situation there after his departure if russia does not become a civilized state which respects its neighbors and the norms of international law before nazarbayevs departure portnikov says then russian aggression in kazakhstan isinevitable and it will involve far larger forces far more instability and this will lead to serious ethnic clashes in russias middle volga asked when moscow will leave ukraine in peace portnikovsays that will happen only if the ukrainian leadership together with that of the us and the european union agree to the following russian conditions recognition of crimea as part of russia the federalization of ukraine state status for the russian language and russian control of the gas pipeline network if all these conditions were to be fulfilled that is if ukraine the us and the eu capitulate before russia then moscow will leave us in peace he says otherwise it will continue its destabilizing actions in ukraine and those in turn will destabilize the entire region and russia itself window on eurasia sochi officials resumed killing homeless animals after olympic journalists left activist says paul goble staunton june 2 – in a classic example of how international attention can restrain russian officials and how the end of such attention frees them to resume what they were doing an animal rights activist reports that sochi officials have restarted their campaign to kill homeless animals since western journalists left following the olympiad tatyana leshchenko one of the leaders of the animal rights movement in the north caucasus says that international outrage in the runup to the olympiad forced sochi officials to suspend the killing but when all the journalists left they resumed it and on an even greater scale rosbaltrufederal201405311274056html her comments come as the russian federal assembly is discussing a bill that would provide some additional protections for animals leshchenko says that the new law must focus on promoting sterilization of pets otherwise however often officials wipe out homeless animals new ones will appear the problem wont go away and these programs are by their nature cruel she continues in sochi since the olympics a private firm has been killing 300 to 500 homeless animals each month and collecting a bounty of about a thousand rubles 30 us dollars for each paid for out of taxes collected from the population what is happening now especially in the private sector is unbearable leshchenko continues those who are engaged in the killings are making profits and the animals are suffering and the authorities are not promoting sterilization or punishing those who toss animals into the streets russian laws against animal cruelty do not work at all she says people get a dog or cat and then throw it in the street when they get tired of it like an old coat and nothing happens equally unfortunately these laws allow anyone to declare an animal aggressive and dangerous something that opens the way to abuse and mistreatment shelters help but they are not by themselves the answer leshchenko insists in sochi during the olympics one was set up with the help of a private foundation it soon filled up because people kept disposing of cats and dogs sterilization is only way she says to end this vicious cycle window on eurasia how eurasianism became the neoeurasianism of today paul goble staunton june 2 – two new studies one a biography of the late ethnic theorist lev gumilyev and another an investigation of the eurasianists of the 1920s throw new light on how classical eurasianism was transmitted to its recent advocates and how they transformed it into something quite different than the original the first of these a justreleased volume by ivan smirnov entitled ascents and descents in the history of ethnoses about the life and creativity of ln gumilyev – a view from the 21st century in russian moscow urss 2014 was reviewed by mikhail roshchin last week kavkazovedinfonews20140531zagadkimutagenovpassionarnostinovajaknigaozhizniitvorchestvelvagumilevahtml smirnov 19662013 was a botanist who became interested in gumilyevs work because of his own focus on plant selection in recent years roshchin points out he increasingly devoted himself to political topics and attracted widespread attention for his article how is russia not like nigeria in russian moscow liberal mission 2006 what has made gumilyev so difficult for many to understand smirnov writes in his book is that the ethnographer worked at the intersect point of several academic disciplines and arrived as it were too early by which his biographer means that gumilyev had to sketch out ideas for which there is not yet an established body of evidence that evidence smirnov says is now beginning to be gathered but this synthesis is only beginning and has not yet given sufficient material for those brave and enormous generalizations which are foundin gumilyevs works that is true in particular of his theory of the passionbased rise and decay of ethnic communities a set of ideas that remains a hypothesis if one agrees with tht approach roshchin says then it will be easier to accept and understand gumilyev something that an exclusive effort to find confirmation or disconfirmation will not allow smirnov in short insists that the eurasianism of gumilyev is more a methodology than a description of reality in the course of his review roshchin draws attention to a definite personal motive behind smirnovs decision to write about gumilyev his grandfather was in the same cell of moscows kresti prison in 1938 another encounter in stalins camps is the centerpiece of the second new article one entitled the birth of euasianism as an idea system by igor kefeli a st petersburg historian and the editor of the russian journal geopolitics and security ntvspbsturuntvarticleh2172201307 reposted last week at rossiyanavsegdaruread2018 kefeli argues that eurasianism msut not be considered as some historiosophic relic limited to the time frames of the eurasian movement of the 1920s and 1930s it had a prehistory in nineteenth century thought and it is acquiring new live in the present time with the formation of the eurasian union after surveying the proeurasian ideas of vladimir lamansky pyor chaadayev nikolay danilevsky and fyodor tyuchev kefeli argues that their most important contribution was not only an insistence on russia as a civilization separate from europe or asia but also a focus on the historical age of these civilizations and others as an indication of their vitality following the bolshevik revolution a group of russian émigré intellectuals elaborated classical eurasianism as a way of seeking to integrate communism with russian nationalism and thus justify cooperation with the soviets none of these were more prolific in their writings than petr savitsky 18951968 after studying at petersburgs polytechnic university he worked in the russian embassy in oslo in 19161917 was an aide to baron wrangel who commanded white russian forces in the south during the civil war and then went into emigration in bulgaria germany and ultimately czechoslovakia savitsky accepted the arguments of those like lamansky that there are three distinct continents in between the atlantic and the pacific europe eurasia and asia and that russia was the same as eurasia but he gave additional stress to the idea that eurasian culture was very different and fundamentally opposed to the grecoroman culture of europe the eurasianist also insisted that the relations between the russian nation and the other nations of eurasia were fundamentally different than those among other nations and in particular do not have any analogies in the international relati0ns of the colonial empires of the european states during world war ii savitsky was the director of the russian gymnasium in prague but in 1945 with the arrival of the soviet army he was arrested condemned for antisoviet activities and sent to the gulag he remained there until 1956 but while incarcerated he attracted perhaps his most prominent student lev gumilyev the conversations of the two while they were political prisoners are lost but the letters that savitsky and gumilyev exchanged between their release in 1956 and savitskys death in 1968 have been preserved in the archives and kefeli has examined them to show how much influence the first had on the second the st petersburg author makes three points first he says savitsky clearly recognizedsaw in gumilyev a likeminded believer in eurasianism as the ideological basis for the future second the two agreed that eurasianism was in the first instance about imagery and opposition to the west and third they shared a reverence for chingiz khan and the mongols as the formative figures of eurasia and thus of russia in summing up his research on this correspondence kefeli argues that what makes eurasianism so important now is that it insists on the necessity of the restoration of the status of russia as a super power within a reviving eurasian union as one of the centers of a polycentric world and although the st petersburg scholar does not say so it is clear that eurasianist ideas have suffered a certain primitivization as they passed from the 19th century writers to savitsky to gumilyev and even more as they have become the neoeurasianism of those like aleksandr dugin and vladimir putin who are seeking to implement them",

The Russophiles in Washington simply ignore anything that interferes with their “reset” play nice with the Kremlin foolishness. It is supposed to be the policy of the United States to isolate Russia and Putin due to his brazen and totally illegal seizure of Crimea and on-going lawless behavior in eastern Ukraine, but you would never know it by the behavior of some of the so-called elites in Washington. This is exactly the type of event that should have been very publicly cancelled. And, I cannot help but note – again – that this disgraceful event will be allowed to use the and the invitation states that “leading American and Russian experts” will participate - - surely the very people who should be boycotting such an event with its disgraceful message that things must go on regardless what Russia does to violate international agreements and critical norms of civilized behavior. Even given DC’s attitudes it is a bit hard to believe this bunch is going to be allowed to use the Hart Senate Office Building while Russia illegally occupies Crimea. Would Syria be allowed to use the building for a friendship conference right now?\n\n The Moscow Times – Crimean Prime Minister [so-called prime minister] Ready to Coerce Greedy Retailers\n\n Kyiv Post – Russia: Luhansk events prove Kyiv doesn’t want to seek ways of restoring national accord\n\n You know, you just cannot make up the preposterous stuff spit out by Russia’s Foreign Ministry. The international criminals who created the unrest in Ukraine and continue full speed supporting it want to condemn Ukraine’s government for not capitulating to Kremlin desires. It would make a comedy routine if it weren’t so serious and if the West wasn’t so ineffective in dealing with the Kremlin.\n\n GlobalPost – Things are getting even weirder in the ‘People’s Republic of Donetsk’\n\n Pitty the poor majority of the population who seem to have to continue to suffer under the intimidation and pretend governance of Russian thugs doing Putin’s bidding\n\n Kyiv Post – In Russia-ruled Crimea, a crackdown on journalists and activists who don’t toe Kremlin line\n\n Oh the glories of being a part – even if an illegal part – of Putin’s self-styled empire.

He thinks the key is negotiating with the Russia-led “separatists” who focused purpose is destabilization and nowhere does he even recognize Crimea as an on-going issue. Such is much of the “elite” thinking about Ukraine in the West. Ukraine and – indeed – the West deserves better insights and leadership.\n\n Atlantic Council – James Rupert – To Liberate Ukraine, Get the Maidan Back in the Fight\n\n As recently as in criticizing Klitchko’s now withdrawn desire to dismantle Maidan I have strenuously said Maidan is essentially a living movement and civil societies check on government. Getting it – or an eastern version in the fight certainly would be powerful. But we also must remember Maidan was a spontaneous protest of Ukraine’s civil society. We might suggest but any action will have to raise up from civil society.\n\n European Council on Foreign Relations – Volker Stanzel – The Ukraine crisis and the West’s true problem\n\n First of all it might be important to note Stanzel is a retired German diplomat and the former ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany to Japan and China.

In a special section below you will find a Spiegel OnLine item about Putin’s propaganda war. It is interesting and tells you a lot about what is going on – especially in Europe.

So if they are going to call for or would support a reduction in tensions and a de-escalation, it would be more effective for them to end those activities.” – Jen Psaki State Department spokesperson THE FRIENDSHIP SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON, DC \n\n welcomes you to the following events and activities, as well as offers you the opportunity to view the services and activities offered by many of our members.

Crimean Prime Minister Ready to Coerce Greedy Retailers\n\n Faced with spiraling price inflation, Crimean Prime Minster Sergei Aksyonov [Note of course the Moscow Times’ ready acceptance of the thug Aksvonov who, unable to win anything by standing for election, became make-believe prime minister as part of Putin’s illegal seizure of Crimea. RAM] threatened price-hiking retailers on the peninsula with \"coercive measures\" and canceled licenses.\n\n Addressing \"all these who do not understand the easy way,\" at a meeting of the [Illegal] Crimean Council of Ministers on Monday, Aksyonov was quoted by Interfax as saying \"there will be coercive measures, right up to license removals. We do not plan to negotiate with any speculators or retailers who extort money from people.\" [Oh my, Aksvonov is OK with illegal invasions but outraged it has led to inflation. Such is the state of mind of the ignorant and greedy. RAM]\n\n Since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March, the price of many goods has doubled, the head of Crimea's Trade Union Federation, Vladimir Klychnikov, told Interfax. \n\n Aksyonov said retailers of food and medicines would be first in line for authorities' attention. Russia: Luhansk events prove that Kyiv doesn't want to seek ways of restoring national accord\n\n June 2, 2014, 9:22 p.m. | Ukraine — by Interfax-Ukraine \n\n \n\n Russian Foreign Ministry released a statement saying Lugansk events proved that Kyiv doesn't want to seek ways of restoring national accord.\n\n Moscow – The deadly air strike on the Luhansk regional state administration building, in which civilians were killed, is a flagrant violation of the Geneva agreements and of the roadmap, proposed by Switzerland as the country holding the rotating presidency of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on its Web site. Things are getting even weirder in the 'People's Republic of Donetsk' Reporter’s notebook: the tides are changing in the already bizarre fake state. DONETSK, Ukraine — It wasn’t always this way. \n\n Gaining entry into the towering regional administration here — seized nearly two months ago by local pro-Russian separatists [It does get tiresome debunking the silliness of calling these people pro-Russian separatists. Oh sure, by now there are disgruntled and misguided Ukrainians involved but the entire conflict and continuing control is in the hands of Russians who invaded Ukraine for the purpose of destabilizing the country – “Russian pros” not “pro-Russians. RAM] and converted into their barricaded, trash-strewn headquarters — was fairly difficult.\n\n Grubby, leather-skinned men with blunt weaponry would stop prospective visitors cold, sometimes denying entry even after being presented with official press credentials.\n\n But last Friday, a day after a heavily armed, largely foreign fighting unit called the Vostok Battalion seized the premises and chased out many of its typically ragged inhabitants, few of the men at the door seemed to put up a fight.\n\n Flashing press passes granted by the “People's Republic of Donetsk,” reporters shuffled through easily.\n\n Almost too easily.\n\n That's probably because a day earlier, something of an elaborate show had kicked off, partly aimed at casting this diplomatic no-man’s-land in a more disciplined and orderly — if not exactly wholesome — light.\n\n For weeks, the hulking administration building, its façade obscured by junkyard barricades of tires, wood planks and barbed wire, was home to the disenfranchised, largely blue-collar masses that’d driven the protest movement here. [But to whatever extent the ”masses” (which all polling show to be in the minority) were involved it remains a fact that the whole criminal enterprise is the doing of Russians. RAM]\n\n Inside the Soviet-era monolith, the corridors were scattered with broken furniture and festooned with anti-Kyiv slogans and crude denouncements of both Ukrainian and Western leaders. The repulsive stench of sweat and trash wafted throughout. \n\n It was the separatists’ answer to the sprawling barricades and tent encampments of Maidan, the nerve center of the months-long anti-government protests in Kyiv.\n\n But those days were apparently over.\n\n On Thursday, the Vostok Battalion fighters appeared — masked and heavy weapons drawn — and cleared most of them out of the building within hours, a move leaders said was aimed at rooting out looters and other ruffians that had plagued their ranks.

RAM] \n\n That evening, rebel authorities invited journalists inside, offering what they said was proof of their former comrades’ misdeeds: reportedly, water bottles, cigarettes and small snacks, all looted from a local supermarket as the battle for the airport raged on nearby.\n\n “It was apparent that there needed to be a firm crackdown,” said Alexander, a security guard for the rebel leadership, told GlobalPost during a visit to the building the following day.\n\n No longer, he added, would it be acceptable for protesters to roam around in masks with baseball bats.\n\n The building, Alexander went on, would now serve strictly as a government headquarters, not a hang out spot for unwashed protesters.\n\n A sense of discipline and efficiency — as far as lawless quasi-states go, at least — was apparently descending on the “People's Republic of Donetsk.”\n\n Rebel leaders, particularly Alexander Borodai, the “prime minister” of the republic, were forced to deny speculation that the building’s takeover by the Vostok Battalion — comprised mostly of fighters from around Russia, including Chechens — amounted to an armed power grab.\n\n They instead pitched it as a “police operation.” Several Vostok members in plain clothes were spotted inside the administration building the day after the takeover.\n\n Borodai, a Muscovite, appears in control of both the Vostok fighters —some of which serve as his bodyguards — and, increasingly, of the republic itself.\n\n He cuts the image of a warlord, but one whose strategy and intentions are difficult to read.\n\n One night earlier this week, as he dined with associates in a hotel restaurant chock full of Western reporters, his aide — a lanky and bearded man named Sergei — was dispatched across the room to extend reporters an offer few could’ve refused.\n\n That was to accompany a rebel caravan as it escorted more than 30 dead Russian fighters, killed in last week’s botched attack on the airport here, from a local hospital morgue and across the border, to be buried on their motherland.\n\n Not only was it the first open admission by the rebel leadership here that foreign fighters have played a key role in the insurgency, but it was a somewhat unusual display of openness much of the press hadn’t seen before.\n\n Outside the morgue the following day, hordes of journalists flocked around the rows of red coffins that lay stacked on the lawn, unsure of the rebels’ game plan.\n\n Meanwhile, Borodai and another top rebel leader, Denis Pushilin, made their rounds and fielded questions from the press.\n\n But as time went on — at some point, a short-tempered thug threatened to shoot reporters who wouldn’t step away from the loading zone — a rumor briefly circulated that the bodies were actually already inside the coffins, sitting under the sweltering sun for at least an hour.\n\n That was quickly debunked, however, after the fifth or sixth casket was loaded onto a white cargo truck. It was clear by the way the men were loading them — like one-handed, while talking on a cell phone — they were empty.\n\n The bodies, it turns out, were actually being held at a rebel-controlled ice cream factory outside of town. Space at the morgue had apparently run out.\n\n But amid the confusion, the rebel leaders spoke openly about their dead comrades’ Russian origins, while at least one living Vostok member spoke openly about how he’d traveled to Ukraine in order to help fend off the military’s “anti-terrorist” operation — even about the $100-per-week food allowance he received for it.\n\n It was about this time that the Vostok Battalion staged its brazen siege on the administration building across town.\n\n By the time the bodies were well on their way to the Russian border, the barricades around the building had begun coming down — and in full view of the media, most of which had rushed over to catch a glimpse rather than join the convoy many were uncertain would make it (it did).\n\n To observers, it is becoming increasingly clear that the affairs of the “People’s Republic of Donetsk” are being closely choreographed while a new order, much different from the ragged protesters of the past, is settling in.\n\n The problem is, no one quite knows yet who the show is for.\n\n One thing, however, is certain: for many ordinary Ukrainians —unaccustomed to guerilla-style insurgencies raging in their front yard — it is anything but a spectacle.\n\n Artyom, an 18-year-old university student in Donetsk, told GlobalPost that armed gunmen had stormed his dormitory building the same day as Vostok fighters commandeered the regional administration, demanding to see proof of the students’ registration there.\n\n For Artyom, a first year philology student at a local university who asked that his name be changed for fears of his personal safety, the fear is nothing new.\n\n An active pro-Ukraine protester, he was been beaten earlier this spring and even briefly kidnapped by pro-Russian thugs, allegedly for wearing a lapel pin featuring Ukraine’s coat of arms.\n\n But the conflict has also hit home for him: on a recent evening, he was scouring the premises of the rebel headquarters searching for his father, who’d taken up arms behind the barricades.\n\n Even before he’d lost contact with him — about two weeks ago — their relations were strained. Now, he says, despite their fundamental differences, he wants to find his father before fighting breaks out again in Donetsk.\n\n “I never would’ve thought that this sort of situation could unfold in Ukraine,” he said. In Russian-ruled Crimea, a crackdown on journalists and activists who don't toe Kremlin line June 1, 2014, 8:44 a.m. | Ukraine — by Kyiv Post \n\n \n\n Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev (R) waves as he walks in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, on May 25 with Minister for Crimean Affairs Oleg Savelyev (C) and Putin's envoy to Crimea, Oleg Belaventsev (L), accompanying Medvedev. Independent journalists and civic activists have had an increasingly difficult time working in Ukraine. Russia's law enforcement agency has arrested at least four activists suspected of terrorism; advocates for the suspects say the accusations are false and meant to intimidate those who don't agree with the Kremlin's illegal occupation of Crimea.\n\n © AFP \n\n SIMFEROPOL, Crimea -- The entrance to the Simferopol Trade Union building, which stands opposite the Cabinet of Ministers on Lenin Square, has been obstructed daily by members of so-called Crimean self-defense militias since March.\n\n These men, dressed in camouflage and armed with police batons and sometimes guns, wander into the building freely, where their frequent destination is the office of the Center for Investigative Journalism. “We’ve all come across them,” says journalist Tatiana Kurmanova wearily. “They make no concrete demands. They just have the effect of scaring us – imagine the first time when they came in here with pistols, looking at everything.”\n\n The center, financed through grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development and other foreign donors, was one of the first media organizations to receive such unwanted attention in Russia-controlled Crimea. If Russian President Vladimir Putin remains in control of Ukraine's peninsula and follows the same policy for Crimea that he does with the rest of the Russian Federation, then foreign-funded projects -- in particular those with USAID funding - will be targets for shutdown. \n\n The Crimean self-defense members marched into the journalism center's office on March 1, two days after soldiers without insignia appeared throughout the peninsula and set in motion the Russian invasion and occupation or – as Russian law would have it - annexation of Crimea. The self-defense militias, ungoverned by any law, have since become a permanent fixture of daily life in Crimea, patrolling streets, guarding transport hubs and government buildings, demanding to see the documents of passersby – and harassing journalists. \n\n While attacks on media have abated somewhat since March, when the Center for Investigative Journalism recorded 85 incidents, Crimea has by no means become a safe place for journalists. \n\n Oleg Sentsov was arrested earlier this month in Crimea where the human rights situation is rapidly deteriorating, and now he's been charged by Russia with planning a terrorist attack.Russia's Federal Security Service has accused Sentsov of being a member of Ukrainian right-wing group, Pravey Sector, adding that he was in possession of explosives, firearms and nationalist paraphernalia. The German film group funding Sentsov's project says the filmmaker's only 'crime' was that he opposed Russia's annexation of Crimea. \n\n In the last six weeks, Andrey Krisko, who heads the Crimean Human Rights Field Mission, has registered nine serious incidents of harassment of journalists, involving personal harm, damage to equipment and illegal detention for more than three hours. He experienced one such incident himself, when he was physically prevented from taking pictures of a journalist arguing with self-defense forces on May 17. Later, he found out the journalist had been followed and detained. \n\n Most cases, Krisko said, concern not single but groups of journalists, and all cases involve the self-defense militias. Some cases have been widely publicized, like that of journalist Osman Pashayev on May 18. Pashayev was filming the Crimean Tatar meeting commemorating 70 years of their deportation, and the hundreds of riot police guarding Simferopol city center, when self-defense forces detained both him and his Turkish cameraman. They were held for 10 hours, had all their equipment taken away, and were denied access to lawyers until a threatened appeal to the prosecutors office. \n\n Kurmanova thinks there are probably many more such incidents involving the self-defense and Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB under its Russian acronym, but journalists working for Crimean government media do not want to publicize them. Most of the journalists who have spoken publicly, like Pashayev, left Crimea afterwards as soon as they could.\n\n Meanwhile several Crimean civil activists who supported the EuroMaidan Revolution that ousted President Viktor Yanukovych on Feb. 22 and protested against Russian occupation are currently detained by the FSB. \n\n The FSB said on May 30 that film director Oleg Sentsov, Alexandr Kolchenko, Oleksiy Chyrniy and Hennadiy Afanasyev are under arrest charged with being members of Ukraine's ultra-nationalistic Right Sector and suspected of plotting to stage acts of sabotage and terrorist attacks in several cities of the peninsula. \n\n Kateryna Serhatskova, a journalist and coordinator of an initiative group to help Sentsov, says Sentsov, Kolchenko, Chyrniy and Afanasyev have never been members of Right Sector.\n\n \"For those who have doubts: these guys have never been members of the Right Sector and prepared no terrorist attacks, these are absolutely peaceful people, who maintained the integrity of Ukraine. Now confessions are being forced out of them, and probably one of them will admit his guilt all in all. It's outrageous nonsense. No comment,\" Serhatskova wrote on her Facebook page on May 30, according to Interfax-Ukraine news service. \n\n The whereabouts of two more activists, Timur Shaimardanov and Leonid Korzh, reported missing by the Ukrainian organisation Ukrainian House on May 28, are unknown. \n\n The effect of this intimidation has been to effectively silence critical or opposition media to the Russian annexation within Crimea. TV channel ATR and the website 15 Minutes, both owned by Crimean Tatar businessman Lenur Islyamov, have greatly cut down on their live programming and news coverage since March.\n\n The only other independent agencies left, the Center for Investigative Journalism and the Radio Liberty-supported project Crimean Reality, both have regular problems with the self-defense militias.\n\n “This situation when there are these groups that don’t answer to anyone, that aren’t controlled by any law, means it’s impossible to say journalists can work professionally here,” says Krisko. “The risk of damage to equipment or personal attacks, as well as fear of censorship, means that those who want to give objective information simply can’t.”\n\n In methods reminiscent of Soviet tactics, smear campaigns, censorship and simple exclusion by news sources are also silencing journalists who might want to show a less one-sided, pro-Russian view of current affairs in Crimea. Kurmanova and her colleagues regularly receive online threats and hate mail since the beginning of March. \n\n Meanwhile two journalists from the Yevpatoria council-funded newspaper Yevpatoria Health Resort, who had been less than enthusiastic about Russian occupation, became subject to an attempted witch hunt in May when rival journalists sent a letter accusing them of being spies and provocateurs to the city council.\n\n \"We don’t demand the exile of these people from their town and their profession,\" according to the letter. \"But we Yevpatorians do not need these masked ‘fifth columnists’ in our hometown, and paid from the town budget!\"\n\n It concludes by saying that if the town council does not remove them from the paper, \"we will appeal to the FSB demanding they protect us Russian citizens from journalists openly conducting subversive activities.\" \n\n The two journalists have so far held on to their jobs, and did not want to comment further on the incident. Since the end of February, when a new Crimean parliament was announced, journalists from the Center for Investigative Journalism have not been able to get parliamentary accreditation. Lawmakers refuse to speak to them, or call them \"American spies.\" The Crimean Cabinet of Ministers’ press service does not answer their calls. They are not informed of meetings and press conferences, or are denied entry.\n\n “There’s a very clear difference between journalists from Russian media who can get into the offices of officials and anywhere else with no problem, and journalists from Ukrainian media who might ask awkward questions,” says Kurmanova. “We’re like white crows; no one wants to talk to us. Before it was all organised, we could write a request for information, or set up filming. Now we get our information in bits and pieces, grabbing officials outside buildings, if they agree to speak.”\n\n Shevket Ganiyev, editor-in-chief of Crimean Tatar programming at the Crimean state broadcasting company TRK, was excluded from news coverage through a different method: He and his director were simply sent home for a month’s holiday. \n\n Ganiyev’s small amount of allotted live broadcasting had already been taken off air with no warning in March, before a hastily-organised referendum on joining Crimea to Russia. Ganiyev and his colleagues, who like most Crimean Tatars openly opposed the referendum, then agreed with TRK management (which openly supported it) that his department would boycott working at TRK until after the referendum. When his team came back on air, they were subject to much closer control. \n\n On April 24, they were told they could not make any mention at all of Crimean Tatar governing body the Mejlis, or of Crimean Tatar leaders Mustafa Jemilev and Refat Chubarov in their programming. This has meant the editorial has had to ignore events widely covered in the international media – including Russian.\n\n “If there’s news in Russian media and we are not allowed to talk about it, how can any journalist accept this as normal?” asks Ganiyev. “We’re not just banned from talking about the Mejlis as good or bad. We are not even allowed to cover facts.” \n\n The same day as the ban, Ganiyev and the editorial director were asked by TRK management to take a month’s leave.\n\n “Of course they didn’t say so, but I think they had to send us on holiday because then our collective would be easier to control,” says Ganiyev. “May was a worrying time for them because of the 70th anniversary of the [Crimean Tatar] deportation and events connected with that. I think they were scared and tried to protect themselves.” \n\n Ganiyev was back at work from May 28, but he and his team have no idea what the future will bring amid the general upheaval at TRK, which was formerly funded by the Ukrainian government but is now is a state of stasis. For the Crimean Tatar editorial, this is yet another set-back in their fight for more airtime in their own language. Their live airtime was reduced over a year ago to 13 minutes news a day, and their recorded programming is exclusively about cultural and social matters.\n\n We’re hostages in this situation,” says Ganiyev. “For us, the most important things are to preserve our work places and editorial so that we can broadcast in Crimean Tatar language. If tomorrow they kick us out and bring in new journalists who are convenient for them and who speak in incorrect Crimean Tatar they’ll be pleased, because it will start the assimilation of our language.” \n\n Under the Ukrainian license still being used at TRK, Crimean Tatar language is allotted seven percent of overall airtime. Ukrainian language programming before March was even more limited. Since March, one of just three weekly Ukrainian language programmes has switched to Russian. Svetlana Datsenko, editor of one of the two remaining Ukrainian programmes, said she had also been asked to switch to Russian. “If there are three equal state languages in Crimea then there should be proportional coverage, 33 percent for each language,” Ganiyev points out. But neither he nor Datsenko have much expectation of that happening. \n\n The new head of TRK, Boris Nemets, is from Crimean government head Sergei Aksyonov’s Russian Unity party, as is the new Crimean minister for information. The party’s key campaigning platform is Russian language rights.\n\n As Crimea moves rapidly towards adopting Russian legislation, the situation for a free media is only set to get worse.\n\n On top of harassment and exclusion, staff of the Center for Investigative Journalism have a whole array of logistical problems to deal with. Their salaries, paid from foreign donors, are frozen as the Crimean banking system has collapsed. \n\n They have been told to vacate their rented offices by the end of July. Russian legislation, which comes into force in Crimea in January, requires that their organisation register as a foreign agent, and completely bans their main donor, USAID. Increasingly repressive Russian laws can shut down opposition websites, and impose prison sentences on anyone questioning Russian territorial integrity (which would include Crimea) in the media.\n\n Meanwhile a law legalizing the self-defense militias has already passed its first reading in the Crimean parliament. According to Kurmanova, it grants the militias a wide range of powers to stop, search, confiscate and detain, with minimum responsibilities. As state media in Crimea produces a soothing stream of information about a bright Russian future, ignoring the economic and social problems since annexation and downplaying or disregarding non-Russian ethnic groups, it is little surprise that Kurmanova and Datsenko from TRK both plan to leave Crimea for mainland Ukraine by the end of the summer.\n\n “We had strict editorial standards and I suppose that’s why it's hardest of all for us, because now no one here needs such editorial standards,’ says Kurmanova. “It’s easier just not to ask questions and to keep quiet.”\n\n Editor’s Note: This article has been produced with support from www.mymedia.org.ua, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and implemented by a joint venture between NIRAS and BBC Media Action.

U.S. EX-IM BANK PROVIDES UKRAGROCOM & HERMES-TRADING FINANCING FOR A GRAIN STORAGE FACILITY FROM GRAIN SYSTEMS, INC. (GSI), A U.S. COMPANY KIROVOHRAD, UKRAINE & WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The group of companies UkrAgroCom & Hermes-Trading has continued its successful work on the international markets and expanding its range of available financial instruments. More and more projects have been realized, related to the attraction of direct financing from international financial institutions. The advantages are obvious – lower cost and longer pay-off periods. It is well known that international financing has more advantageous terms however the process of attracting the funds is much more complex and takes more time. Despite all possible difficulties that could arise from the process of attracting direct export financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank), the group of companies UkrAgroCom & Hermes-Trading decided to work actively in that direction. Today’s result is great proof for the correctness of the decision made – the financial deal has been successfully executed and the necessary funds have been received. The acquired financing was used for purchasing modern, leading elevator equipment of high quality from Grain Systems Inc. (GSI), (www.grainsystems.com) for one of the leading elevators of the group – PJSC Sharivske with total storage capacities of 81 thousand tons of simultaneous storage of grain. \"To be unbiased I should say that this was one of the projects in the financial history of our group that took the longest time to complete. There were high requirements us from the U.S. Ex-Im Bank and we were successful in meeting meet all of them. This achievement is very pleasing and give us hope for the future potential of this instrument regarding financing the Ukrainian agricultural sector\", according to Oleksii Skichko, CFO of Hermes-Trading LLC. \"The well organized work and successful results became possible thanks to the efficient work of the Export-Import Bank of the United States of America (Ex-Im Bank) and the American financial company, American Trade & Finance Company, as well as to our Ukrainian banking partners PJSC Deutsche bank Ukraine and PJSC Ukrsotsbank.\" The acquired experience and acquaintance with the financial market of the USA will allow to make new steps, bigger and more confident, in development of the existing and new projects – large-scale, highly technological and innovative. The projects of the group of companies UkrAgroCom & Hermes-Trading are often among the leading ones not only in the region but in all of Ukraine: - Svitlovodsk River Terminal is the only river terminal in Kirovohrad region and the biggest on the Dnipro river in Ukraine. - Dairy farm Petrykivske Moloko is the most powerful dairy farm for 5 thousand heads of Holstein cattle in Kirovohrad region and one of the leading ones in Ukraine.\n\n The backbone for such success is the well-coordinated work with financial partners in Ukraine and abroad as well as management’s (of the group of companies UkrAgroCom & Hermes-Trading) clear understanding of responsibilities of the decisions being made and their effect on stability and economic development of society, number of jobs and wealth of communities. Together we will achieve success. Ukraine is United. Keep moving forward!\" stated CFO Skichko. UNITED STATES COMPANIES GSI AND AGCO\n\n The members of the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC) congratulate the group of companies UkrAgroCom & Hermes-Trading on their success in completing financing from the U.S. Ex-Im Bank and for their decision to buy grain storage equipment from GSI, a U.S. company headquartered in Assumption, Illinois, said Morgan Williams, Director, Government Relations, Washington, D.C. office of SigmaBleyzer, who also serves as President of USUBC. \"GSI, www.grainsystems.com, is the world's largest manufacturer of steel farm grain bins, commercial storage grain bins and grain silos. In addition, they offer technologically advanced grain dryers in the industry and a large selection of material handling systems including grain bin sweeps, grain spreaders, chain loop systems, bucket elevators, chain conveyors, enclosed belt conveyors, support towers, and catwalks\", Williams stated. \"GSI became part of the AGCO corporation a few years ago, also a major U.S. company.\"\n\n \n\n AGCO, www.agcocorp.com, is a global leader focused on the design, manufacture and distribution of agricultural machinery. They support more productive farming through a full line of tractors, combines, hay tools, sprayers, forage equipment, tillage, implements, grain storage and protein production systems, as well as related replacement parts. AGCO products are available in more than 140 countries worldwide, including Ukraine, through a network of 3,150 independent dealers and distributors. AGCO is led by five core global brands: \n\n (1) Challenger \n\n (2) Fendt \n\n (3) GSI \n\n (4) Massey Ferguson \n\n (5) Valtra SPECIAL SECTION – HOW RUSSIA IS WINNING THE PROPAGANDA WAR \n\n \n\n The Opinion-Makers: How Russia Is Winning the Propaganda War\n\n May 30, 2014 – 04:07 PM With the help of news services like RT and Ruptly, the Kremlin is seeking to reshape the way the world thinks about Russia. And it has been highly successful: Vladimir Putin has won the propaganda war over Ukraine and the West is divided. Ivan Rodionov sits in his office at Berlin's Postdamer Platz and seems to relish his role as the bad guy. He rails in almost accent-free German, with a quiet, but sharp voice, on the German media, which, he claims, have been walking in \"lockstep\" when it comes to their coverage of the Ukraine crisis. During recent appearances on two major German talk shows, Rodionov disputed allegations that Russian soldiers had infiltrated Crimea prior to the controversial referendum and its annexation by Russia. He says it's the \"radical right-wing views\" of the Kiev government, and not Russia, that poses the threat. \"Western politicians,\" he says, \"are either helping directly or are at least looking on.\"\n\n Rodionov defends President Vladimir Putin so vehemently that one could be forgiven for confusing him with a Kremlin spokesperson. But Rodionov views himself as a journalist. The 49-year-old is the head of the video news agency Ruptly, founded one year ago and financed by the Russian government. The eighth floor of the office building has a grand view of Germany's house of parliament, the Reichstag. It's a posh location and the Kremlin doesn't seem to mind spending quite a bit of money to disseminate its view of the world from here. Around 110 people from Spain, Britain, Russia and Poland work day and night in the three-floor office space on videos that are then syndicated to the international media.\n\n At first glance, it's not obvious that Ruptly is actually Kremlin TV. In addition to Putin speeches, there are also numerous other video clips available in its archive, ranging from Pussy Riot to arrests of members of the Russian opposition. When it comes to eastern Ukraine, however, the agency offers almost exclusively videos that are favorable towards pro-Russian supporters of the \"People's Republic of Donetsk,\" which was founded by separatists. You'll also find right-wing radicals like Britain's Nick Griffin or German far-right extremist Olaf Rose, an ideologist with the neo-Nazi National Democratic Party (NPD), stirring up hatred towards the European Union and its Ukraine policies.\n\n Propagating the Kremlin's Position\n\n Rodionov says that, since its founding, Ruptly has attracted 14 subscribers and over 200 customers, including German broadcasters \"both public and private.\" Subsidies from Moscow enable Ruptly to offer professionally produced videos at prices cheaper than those of the private competition. The battle over Ukraine is being fought with diverse means -- with harsh words and soft diplomacy, with natural gas, weapons and intelligence services. But perhaps the most important instruments being deployed by Moscow are the Internet, newspapers and television, including allegedly neutral journalists and pundits dispatched around the world to propagate the Kremlin position. \"We're in the middle of a relentless propaganda war,\" says Andrew Weiss, vice president of studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an influential Washington think tank. Weiss describes this propaganda as a crucial tool used by Russia to conduct its foreign policy.\n\n Moscow is looking beyond the short-term, seeking to influence opinion in the long-run to create \"an alternative discourse in Western countries as well,\" says Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of Kremlin foreign broadcaster RT, formerly known as Russia Today, which owns Ruptly. The Kremlin invests around €100 million ($136 million) a year in Russian media abroad in order to influence public opinion in the West. This effort also helps explain why Putin addressed Germans directly in his speech on the annexation of Crimea. Noting the Kremlin had supported Germany's reunification process, he called on Germans to back Russia's reunification with Crimea. Putin's popularity in Germany has declined steadily over the years, but his worldview remains quite popular.\n\n A Triumphant Media Advance\n\n Sources within the Kremlin express satisfaction these days when talking about Moscow's information policies. \"We may have won the war in Georgia in 2008, but we lost the propaganda battle against America and the West by a mile,\" says one. \"Thanks to RT and the Internet, though, we are now closing the gap.\"\n\n Whereas Ruptly is seeking to establish itself as an alternative to Reuters and the Associated Press in providing video footage, RT has already successfully established itself in the nine years since its creation, recently surpassing even CNN when it comes to clips viewed on YouTube. With close to 1.2 billion views, the BBC is the only media outlet ahead of RT. In Britain, RT has more viewers than the Europe-wide news station Euronews and in some major US cities, the channel is the most-viewed of all foreign broadcasters. RT's 2,500 employees report and broadcast in Russian, English, Spanish and Arabic with German to be added soon.\n\n The triumphant advance of Putin's broadcaster began in a former factory in northeast Moscow. Founding RT editor Simonyan was just 25 at the time Putin appointed her in 2005. Her assignment from the Russian president: to \"break the monopoly of the Anglo-Saxon mass media.\" It's a mandate she has been pursuing successfully ever since. \"There's large demand for media that doesn't just parrot the uniform pulp from the Western press,\" says Simonyan. \"Even in Western countries.\" RT gives pro-Russian representatives from Eastern Ukraine far more air time than supporters of the government in Kiev, and not even Simonyan disputes this fact. \"We're something along the lines of Russia's Information Defense Ministry,\" her co-workers say, not without pride.\n\n Ruptly and RT are only the most visible instruments being used by the Kremlin. Other propaganda methods being exploited can be less obvious. For example, when German talk shows invite Russian journalists to speak about the Ukraine crisis, they are almost always pundits who could have been taken directly out of the Kremlin propaganda department. Programmers, of course, like to book these guests because they generate heated and provocative discussion. But it's also a function of the fact that experts critical of the government either don't want to talk or are kept from doing so. Take the example of Sergej Sumlenny, who served until January as the German correspondent for the Russian business magazine Expert. Early on, he appeared often on German talk shows, intelligently and pointedly criticizing Putin's policies. He has since been driven out at the magazine.\n\n In his stead, the Russian perspective is now represented on German talk shows by people like Anna Rose, who is generally introduced as a correspondent for Rossiyskaya Gazeta, or Russian Gazette. The name sounds innocuous enough, but eyebrows should be raised immediately when this \"serious\" Russian journalist begins claiming that the Ukrainian army could be shooting \"at women and children\" and that Russian soldiers need to provide them with protection. Her positions suddenly become more understandable with the knowledge that Rossiyskaya Gazeta is the Russian government's official newspaper.\n\n Manipulating Comments and Social Media \n\n Those who read comments posted under articles about Ukraine on news websites will have noticed in recent months that they have been filled with missives that always seem to follow the same line of argumentation. Moscow's independent business daily Vedomosti reported recently that, since the start of the Ukraine crisis, the presidential administration in Moscow has been testing how public opinion in the United States and Europe can be manipulated using the Internet and social networks. The paper reported that most of the professional comment posters active in Germany are Russian immigrants who submit their pro-Russian comments on Facebook and on news websites.\n\n In addition, journalists and editors at German websites and publications report receiving letters and emails offering \"explosive information about the Ukraine crisis\" on an almost daily basis. The \"sources\" often mention they have evidence about the right-wing nature of the Kiev government that they would like to supply to journalists. The letters are written in German, but appear to include direct translations of Russian phrases. They would seem to have been written by mother-tongue Russian speakers. Other forms of propaganda have also been deployed in recent months. For example, there have been frequent incidences of intercepted conversations of Western diplomats or Kiev politicians getting published in ways that serve Russia's interests. From the \"Fuck the EU\" statement by Victoria Nuland, the top US diplomat to Europe, right up to statements made by Estonia's foreign minister that were apparently supposed to prove who was responsible for the deaths of protesters on Maidan Square. The Russian media also seemed to take pleasure in reporting in mid-April that CIA head John Brennan had traveled to Kiev.\n\n There's a high likelihood that this confidential information and the content of intercepted communications is being strewn by Russian intelligence. Officials at Western intelligence agencies assume that even communications encrypted by the Ukrainian army are being intercepted by the Russians. \n\n Part 2: 'The West Has Never Gotten over Putin's Return' \n\n The Kremlin also deftly exploits the anti-American sentiment of many Western Europeans, by claiming, for example, that American mercenaries and consultants have been deployed in eastern Ukraine. Even today, there is still no evidence to back any of these allegations. But America's credibility isn't helped by the fact that Washington also disseminates its own anti-Russian propaganda. Backed by the drumbeat of conservative Fox News, Republic Senator John McCain has been loudly calling on the US government to provide pro-Western forces with active aid, including weapons. Meanwhile, Forbes magazine has asked: \"Is Putin a new Hitler?\" In addition, Washington's development agency, USAID, announced at the start of May it would provide $1.25 million in support to Ukrainian media organizations as they prepared for presidential elections. Washington has long provided support for a network of opposition groups who were active during the Orange Revolution and are now mobilizing against Moscow.\n\n A media center established by the new government in Kiev's Hotel Ukraina has been partly financed by George Soros' International Renaissance Foundation. Day in and day out, reporters are airing interviews with ministers and loyal political scientists who interpret events in eastern Ukraine the way the Kiev government would like to see them portrayed. Still, Moscow's efforts present a stark contrast to the activities of independent European media companies. Many newspapers and broadcasters have scaled back their bureaus in Moscow or closed them altogether in recent years. This has created a shortage of experts who can penetrate the propaganda coming from all sides and provide honest analysis of what is actually happening.\n\n The fact that the brainwashing seems to be working could be evidenced last Monday when German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier made an appearance in the run-up to elections for the European Parliament on Berlin's Alexanderplatz square. Left-wing activists shouted and booed at the foreign minister and held up signs stating, \"Stop the Nazis in Ukraine!\" Moscow registered the protest with satisfaction and the Kremlin-aligned media reported on it extensively.\n\n Russia's Greatest Propaganda Success \n\n The purpose of this global battle to shape opinion isn't merely to transform Europeans and Americans into fans of Vladimir Putin. The Russian president is also targeting his own people, seeking to make himself unassailable within Russia. Putin's greatest propaganda success is the fact that the majority of Russians now believe that Kiev is ruled by fascists. Evoking World War II in this way has proven very effective with Russians. One member of Russia's parliament, the Duma, even went so far as to call the fire in Odessa that killed 30 pro-Russia activists a \"new Auschwitz.\" Meanwhile, the head of parliament spoke of genocide in Ukraine. With the spin machine at full steam, it is perhaps of little surprise that a radio poll recently found that 89 percent of listeners agreed with the idea that the \"participants of the mass murder in Odessa should be found and executed without trial.\"\n\n Journalists with the Russian state media often like to quote German politicians and experts. Unfortunately, they always seem to pick from the same pack of pundits. One is Putin biographer Alexander Rahr, formerly a Russia specialist at the German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP) and today a consultant with the gas firm Wintershall, which has deep ties with Russia.\" The West has never gotten over Putin's return,\" Rahr says in explaining Germany's position toward the Kremlin. He also claims that German politicians' private beliefs are different from their public statements. They are, he says, only able to express themselves openly about Russia once they have left office.\n\n The Kremlin Seizes Control \n\n A critical analysis of such statements has been lacking. One reason is that in recent months, the Kremlin has begun tightening control over Russian-language Internet media in order to keep the home front from wavering. Russian investigative journalist and security services expert Andrei Soldatov says that Kremlin-aligned youth organizations are assisting the government in posting blogs and attacking Moscow's critics. Most broadcasters and newspapers are already under the Kremlin's control. Some 94 percent of Russians obtain their information primarily from state television. The problem is that state TV has no qualms about blatantly fabricating the news. Two weeks ago, for example, the evening news showed video allegedly depicting the murder of a pro-Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine by nationalists. In fact, the video used was actually one and a half years old and showed fighters in the north Caucasus.\n\n Few have studied the effects of that kind of propaganda as much as Lev Gudkov, the head of independent Moscow pollster Levada. The institution recently had to undergo yet another government review. \"The public prosecutor openly admitted to us that the only reason we haven't been closed yet is that the Kremlin hasn't given the final order to shut us down,\" says Gudkov. \"But we are certainly being harassed.\" The 67-year-old research pulls out one poll after another from a stack of papers. They show that when the mass protests against President Viktor Yanukovych broke out, only 30 percent of Russians believed that Ukraine's Association Agreement with the EU was a \"betrayal of Slavic unity.\" In February, at the peak of the Maidan protests, 73 percent still considered the issue to be an internal one for Ukrainians. In the time that has transpired since, some 58 percent of Russians now support the annexation of eastern Ukraine by Russia.\n\n \"The successful propaganda campaign we are witnessing here surrounding the Ukraine crisis is unique and highly sophisticated, even compared to Soviet standards,\" says Gudkov. \"The Kremlin has succeeded in stirring up sentiments deeply rooted in the Russian psyche: the yearning for an imperial grandness, a sense of anti-Americanism and pride over Russia's victory over Hitler's Germany.\" Ultimately, it was the annexation of Crimea that silenced Putin's critics. Prior to the development, dissatisfaction with Putin had been growing continuously. Polls showed an increasing number of Russians wanted to vote the president out of office. In November 2013, 53 percent said they would vote for a different candidate during the next election. But Putin experienced a meteoric rise in popularity after the annexation, with 86 percent of Russians now saying they would re-elect him. By Moritz Gathmann, Christian Neef, Matthias Schepp and Holger Stark\n\n Translated from the German by Daryl Lindsey By SAMUEL CHARAP JUNE 2, 2014 \n\n WASHINGTON — As the polls closed during last month’s snap presidential elections in Ukraine, violence broke out in the east of the country. Insurgents took over Donetsk airport and the government responded with airstrikes.\n\n Eastern Ukraine has become a breeding ground for an armed insurgency. And if a comprehensive political settlement isn’t reached soon, Ukraine could descend into outright civil conflict. Western governments should make working with the Ukrainian authorities to pursue such an arrangement their top priority.\n\n Until now, the West has prioritized holding a free and fair presidential election and is now celebrating a mission accomplished. As a senior American official put it, “It was a spectacular day for the people of Ukraine who went out in force to choose a new president and to say to their government and to the world that they want a future that is unified, that is democratic, that is prosperous and that is rooted in Europe.”\n\n Without question, having a legitimate head of state is a positive development — all the more so since the president-elect, the oligarch Petro Poroshenko, won over 50 percent of the vote and therefore avoided a second-round runoff (always divisive in Ukraine) for the first time since 1991.\n\n But Western pronouncements, particularly America’s, have misleadingly portrayed the violence as merely an unfortunate backdrop to otherwise successful elections, not as a symptom of an emerging rupture in the Ukrainian polity that could have profound consequences.\n\n While noting the difficulties of voting in Donetsk and neighboring Lugansk, and praising the “courage and determination” of those who worked the polling stations there, a statement from Secretary of State John Kerry on the election did not even condemn the bloodshed, even though the death count in fierce battles between the Ukrainian military, backed by the newly formed (and poorly trained) National Guard, and armed insurgents had already reached triple digits.\n\n Any government has the right to assert its writ on its own sovereign territory. But this “anti-terrorist operation” is being conducted in regions where the population was already overwhelmingly opposed to the government in Kiev. [sic Kyiv] A mid-April poll found that over 70 percent of the population in both Donetsk and Lugansk consider that government “illegal.” A separate survey indicated that 80 percent believe it does not represent all of Ukraine.\n\n The government’s assault on these regions has almost certainly hardened these views. As the Russian government’s first war in Chechnya or the Turkish government’s campaign against Kurdish separatists demonstrate, counterterrorism missions can be deeply counterproductive when the civilian population has as much or more sympathy for the alleged terrorists than it does for the military doing battle with them. [Of course there is a difference between the view that the interim government was illegal and did not represent eastern Ukraine and believing the same thing after the election. There is also a much published – even in the Times – difference between feeling the interim government was illegitimate and wanting to separate from Ukraine – overwhelming majority wishes Ukraine to stay together. RAM]\n\n The Ukrainian government and its Western partners need to focus on three priorities that would do far more to stabilize and unite Ukraine than the recent presidential poll: an end to the “anti-terrorist operation” and a good-faith attempt at a negotiated settlement with separatists in the east; formation of a more inclusive government; and constitutional reform that decentralizes power. [Strange – maybe Obama’s negotiating with the Taliban is setting a new standard – but why should Poroshenko negotiate with so-called “separatists” who are led by Russians who have infiltrated Ukraine for the expressed purpose of destabilizing the country? Likewise, why does Ukraine need to be told to have a more inclusive government and to decentralize power - - both general objectives of the interim and new government and, indeed, directions Ukraine was going before Yanukovych and his cronies pushed Ukrainian governance to new levels of corruption? RAM]\n\n Rather than escalate the assault on the insurgents, thus ensuring more killing of Ukrainians by Ukrainians, the government in Kiev needs to halt it and make a good-faith, high-profile effort at a negotiated solution. The crackdown should resume only if the government can credibly demonstrate to the local population that the separatists refuse to accept a reasonable compromise.\n\n Second, the Ukrainian government must bring regional balance to a government that is currently dominated by representatives from western Ukraine: About two-thirds of ministerial-level and higher portfolios have gone to those regions, which represent only 12 percent of the population. The presidential elections demonstrated that the cabinet is not only regionally skewed, it’s also politically unrepresentative; the far-right Svoboda party, whose leader got less than 2 percent of the vote, has a third of the senior portfolios. Some of these should be allocated to southerners and easterners.\n\n Finally, the constitutional reform package currently being negotiated and debated could transform Ukraine’s diversity into a source of strength. The drafting process must be treated as a top priority by the Ukrainian government and its Western partners. The country desperately needs a decentralized political system so that no Ukrainian feels that his or her way of life is threatened by a change in power in Kiev.\n\n That can only happen through empowering regional governments with direct elections and far greater authority for decision-making on matters other than foreign and defense policy. Unfortunately, the current draft constitutional amendments don’t allow for direct election of governors.\n\n At the same time, the Ukrainian government must avoid policies that aggravate regional divisions. Unfortunately, the United States and the European Union appear poised to assist Kiev in doing precisely that by pushing ahead with Ukraine’s rapid institutional integration into the West.\n\n This agenda continues to be highly divisive in Ukraine. When asked in mid-April about which political and economic orientation — Russia, Europe or both — would be better for the country, Ukrainians were divided: In the west, 82 percent preferred Europe, only 2 percent preferred Russia and 9 percent favored both, while in the east only 16 percent preferred Europe versus 46 percent for Russia and 26 percent for both.\n\n Ukraine’s presidential election was a positive step. But it has not come close to resolving the country’s multifaceted crisis or bridging its deep regional divides. It would be a strategic error for Western policy makers to soft-pedal the other, far more important steps needed to unify Ukraine, or to drive an agenda that pulls it further apart.\n\n Samuel Charap is senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \n\n Know the author: Samuel Charap is the Senior Fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, based in the IISS–US in Washington, DC.\n\n Prior to joining the Institute, Dr. Charap was a Council on Foreign Relations International Affairs Fellow at the US Department of State, serving as Senior Advisor to the Acting Undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security and on the Secretary’s Policy Planning Staff.

To Liberate Ukraine, Get the Maidan Back in the Fight \n\n Tens of thousands of Ukrainians gather on Kyiv's Maidan Nezalezhnosti in December, part of the three-month protest that brought down the Kremlin-dependent government of President Viktor Yanukovych. (CC License)\n\n Let’s consider for a moment what has worked, and not worked, in Ukraine’s fight for freedom from Russian domination. What worked was the Maidan – the massive, determined and (almost completely) non-violent protest movement that overthrew the corrupt, Kremlin-dependent President Viktor Yanukovych. What has not worked has been the Ukrainian government’s patchwork counter-insurgency offensive against Kremlin-backed separatist militias in southeast Ukraine. [I accept the point Rupert is making but cringe at the common quickie of a description of what the Maidan did. “Overthrew” Yanukovych – yes, in the end I suppose it did but more accurately it demanded reforms in the outrageously corrupt government of Yanukovych, reforms he, in the end was unwilling to make. And, when U.S. sanctions began to be applied against many of his insiders they fled and with that he then abandoned his post and his responsibilities and also fled. It takes longer to say or write even this summary but it is much more accurate and the additional facts are important to history and understanding the present. RAM]\n\n \n\n In the current battle for the southeast, Ukraine’s mix of government forces – army units, national guardsmen and provincial-level militias raised by local business magnates – has proven barely able to establish security perimeters around the towns and cities held by Russian-backed [and Russian staffed RAM] secessionist militias.\n\n \n\n If any police-and-military machine exists in the world with the specialized training, weapons, intelligence and communications to wade into Ukraine’s southeastern provinces and surgically excise the disparate separatist militias without hurting local civilians, it doesn’t exist in Ukraine – and it won’t be built there anytime soon.\n\n \n\n That’s a big reason why a number of policy specialists are now arguing that Ukraine, with the help of its international supporters, should lead its fight against Russian subversion in its Donbas (Donetsk Basin) region with the Maidan. More precisely, with non-violent civil resistance.\n\n \n\n As policymakers in Kyiv, Washington, and European capitals focus on economic sanctions against Russia or the proper NATO posture in Eastern Europe, [Is there actual evidence that anyone in the West is actually focusing on sanctions? Really? RAM] they have given virtually no attention to the seemingly fuzzier notion of encouraging civil resistance movements against Russian forces in Donbas or Crimea. That’s a mistake, according to Maciej Bartkowski and Maria Stephan, two policy specialists writing this week on the Atlantic Council’s website.\n\n \n\n Arguably, Ukraine and its friends [Does it have genuine friends that are governments? RAM] should be working hard to build a civil non-cooperation movement for these reasons: \n\n · It works, faster and better than guerrilla warfare. “Historically, nonviolent civil resistance against violent state opponents has been twice as effective as armed struggle in 323 conflicts from 1900 to 2006,” according to research published in 2011 by Stephan, an Atlantic Council non-resident fellow, and co-author Erica Chenoweth. Even better, “civil resistance – which relies on nonviolent tactics including consumer boycotts, worker strikes, political satire, protests, and parallel institutions – is faster, needing on average two and a half years to run its course, compared to nine years for violent resistance.” \n\n · The Ukrainians are good at it. “The Ukrainians have a great history of using non-violent resistance – in the Orange Revolution in 2004 and this year on the Maidan,” Bartkowski said in an interview. As did the United States during its Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, “Ukraine has created a certain culture of non-violent struggle that it now can build upon,” he said. \n\n · It can happen even outside of Kyiv, even in the southeast. As a matter of survival, local communities near the battle in Donbas have autonomously taken steps toward non-violent resistance. The southern city of Mykolayiv gathered its local leaders of the Maidan movement and the anti-Maidan opposition to organize a set of joint street patrols and checkpoints to keep armed groups out of town. And they set up a local information center to check out and quash the panicked rumors and disinformation that often have helped de-stabilize communities facing the threat of militia violence. \n\n · It will leave Ukraine stronger and healthier when it’s over. A non-violent resistance campaign hews closer to the rule of law and the accountability of the powerful that Ukrainians have demanded (in protest marches, opinion surveys and elections). Civil resistance will build civil society in regions that long have been subject to governance by secretive combines of state authorities, corrupt businesses and organized crime. A guerrilla war will build guerrilla forces that, after any conflict, will have to be disarmed and disbanded.\n\n \n\n How to do it? For starters, a Russian-language TV station …\n\n \n\n A civil resistance fight for the future of Donbas would limit, but not eliminate, a role for the security forces. The Kyiv government and its international supporters should build as quickly as possible the Ukrainian military’s ability to seal the country’s border. “Stopping the infiltration of fighters and weapons from Russia” is a critical first step, Bartkowski said, and the US and European governments could help with training and surveillance technology, including unarmed drones. \n\n \n\n “Once the border is better controlled, the military resources should focus on isolating the cities that are dominated by the separatists, controlling the roads and establishing a cordon sanitaire to protect adjacent areas from violence, Bartkowksi said.\n\n \n\n Within the areas dominated by the mix of Russian-backed militias – local separatist fighters, Russian military officers, Russian Cossack police auxiliaries, and Chechen and Ossetian guerrillas – “Ukraine should encourage a campaign of civil resistance, starting with low-risk tactics,” Bartkowski said. The civil resistance campaign that helped oust Chilean dicator Augusto Pinochet began in the early 1980s with the low-risk tactic of cacerolazos, in which protesters banged spoons against casserole dishes in their homes to share the sound and their sense of common purpose against the regime. \n\n \n\n A resistance model for Donbas might be the Czechoslovak non-cooperation with Soviet soldiers who occupied their country in 1968. “To any approach by a Soviet soldier, a citizen’s response was: (1) Don’t know; (2) Don’t care; (3) Don’t tell; (4) Don’t have; (5) Don’t know how to,” etc., Bartkowski and Stephan write.\n\n \n\n A key starting point would be a Russian-language TV station broadcasting from transmitters in government-held territory, to “break the lack of information” for millions of people in Donbas, which receives only broadcasts by Kremlin-allied Russian channels, Bartkowski said. \n\n \n\n The Maidan Needs a Mission\n\n \n\n Finally, a huge reason and resource for building a civil-resistance strategy is this: Three months after overthrowing the corrupt Yanukovych administration, Maidan activists and their young, pro-democratic organizations are looking for ways to sustain their mission.\n\n \n\n Thousands of Ukrainians gathered at the Maidan yesterday in a “people’s assembly” to discuss this very issue. Much of the Maidan’s new focus will be the monitoring of the incoming central government of President-elect Petro Poroshenko and the new Kyiv government of Mayor-elect Vitaliy Klitschko. But the Maidan remains a resource of civic energy and civil resistance that should be tapped, not ignored, in Ukraine’s fight to remain whole and free.\n\n \n\n James Rupert is an editor at The Atlantic Council. The Ukraine crisis and the West’s true problem BY VOLKER STANZEL - 29 MAY 14\n\n Some observers have heaped scorn on the West’s seemingly knee-jerk reaction to the crisis in Ukraine. But in fact, the West’s reaction was not so much a failure as some people think. And the West faces problems that would still remain even if it had reacted differently.\n\n The Ukraine problem \n\n Ukraine still poses a major problem, even after the presidential elections of 25 May. Too many of Ukraine’s politicians have behaved for too long like pilots about to crash, heading for a catastrophe and completely paralysed in the face of it. When he closed the door on the European Union, Viktor Yanukovych knew well that he would run into strong opposition back home. But he would not make even the slightest tactical compromise – if he had, he might still be in his villa.\n\n After Yanukovych signed the agreement to step down no later than December 2014, the Ukrainian Parliament gave in to the fury on the Maidan and removed the president from office, even though it knew that this would represent an intolerable provocation to Vladimir Putin’s Russia. [Hello! The Ukrainian Parliament removed Yanukovych from office – is this guy serious? Once his key supporters were hit with sanctions because of the violence they perpetrated on the people of Maidan they fled and then Yanukovych fled his position and responsibilities. The Parliament then, pursuant to the constitution filled the vacancy he created. Has Stanzel been smoking something or is he just that far out of touch? RAM] Since taking over, the interim leaders have watched the events in Eastern Ukraine as if hypnotised. They have failed to wage a war for the hearts and minds of the people in the region, who, as polls indicated, did not want to become part of Russia, but were left alone with well-trained thugs and separatists from within and beyond the border. And in the end, the leaders in Kyiv did not know better than to send in troops, even at the risk of setting off civil war. [Clever disassociation of the West from the interim government’s approach – how about admitting there was significant pressure from the West for what the interim government did and did not do? RAM]\n\n However, so far, the blood that has been spilled is blood on Putin’s hands. In Germany, many people believe that there is too much empathy for Russia from the Russlandversteher, the “Russia understanders”. But in a crisis, it is important to understand what the situation looks like to the other side. In the eyes of Putin’s Russia, the West is encroaching on Russia’s proper space in an attempt to contain it. At the same time, Russia believes the West is weak because of its dependency on Russian energy. It is decadent as a civilisation and spineless as a political actor. [What Putin thinks should be of little consequence. His paranoia qand his believing in a history he has made up doesn’t justify anything he has done or is doing. Understanding he is a bit wacky in his Napoleonic approach but knowing his sickness is one thing, conceding there is any merit to it would be wrong. RAM]\n\n Putin’s failed gamble \n\n On the other hand, what has Putin’s Russia achieved so far? Only a single costly strategic advantage, achieved by ripping Crimea out of Ukraine. The achievement can be described as costly because Russia reneged on its agreement to leave Ukraine’s borders intact in return for Ukraine giving up its Soviet nuclear stockpile at the end of the Cold War. Putin’s Russia cannot be trusted to keep its word. This is a potentially serious long-term disadvantage: for example, who now believes Putin when he promises to co-operate with the new president of Ukraine? \n\n Putin’s Russia also brought Ukraine closer to disintegration, in its efforts to prevent it from moving towards the EU or NATO. This, again, was achieved at a price. The complete disintegration of Ukraine – which is not yet out of the question – would mean that the eastern part of Ukraine became an economic and political burden for Russia. The western part would move closer to the EU – which Ukraine’s newly-elected President Petro Poroshenko has already stated to be his goal – and, yes, would get closer to some day joining NATO as well. Putin had wanted to raise doubts about NATO’s willingness to abide by its agreements, but NATO’s efforts have reassured the eastern members of the alliance that they can rely on NATO standing by its obligations. [You have to be kidding! First of all this guy – like so many others who have to be beaten down – concedes Crimea. Second, what eastern members of NATO really accept the “assurances” other NATO members offer after watching how much good “assurances” did Ukraine? RAM]\n\n Meanwhile, in Russia itself, Western sanctions will have gradual but unstoppable results, causing negative economic and psychological effects. Putin has had to turn to China, at a high price. This has reminded the Russian public just how much their president has isolated the country and damaged its future economic prospects. From Putin’s point of view, things do not look good. He is trying to realise his pet project, the Eurasian Union, through economic strength based on energy profits along with strong nationalistic sentiments (with religious undertones). But this project and this outlook have brought the country, for the time being, to a dead end. [Does this guy think the people of Russia actually get news that shows and explains Putin’s weakness? What planet is he living on? RAM]\n\n The West’s success \n\n The situation is not only of Putin’s making. The West could not stop Russia from meddling violently in Ukraine. [Really? This is a genuinely stupid statement. The sanctions he touts are at best incremental and applied with multiple mixed signals – genuine, crippling sanctions would not have allowed Putin to operate and he would have had to back off. RAM] But if, as indicated by the results of the presidential elections, Ukraine is moving in a better direction, then this is to a large degree the West’s success. [Don’t pat yourself on your back too hard. RAM] And this success was not easily come by. Each country had its own reasons for pulling against the others and refusing to take action against Russia.\n\n It should not have been unexpected that the United Kingdom was not prepared to rush headlong into comprehensive sanctions against Russia’s financial businesses, given that these enterprises are a mainstay of the UK’s economy. It was hardly astonishing that France hesitated to cancel or violate arms contracts with Russia, which were partly paid already. It was even less surprising that countries such as the Baltic States, Slovakia, Hungary, and Germany, which are heavily dependent on Russian energy deliveries, should pause before exposing their economies to energy supply crises. Japan, which is finally improving its long troubled relations with Russia, was clearly not going to be eager to worsen its situation. With the United States being far less economically involved with Russia, it was entirely predictable that it should see things somewhat differently, and, in consequence, be only barely able to keep control of the Western coalition. [The world of wimps, not a leader among them. RAM]\n\n But this whole situation was the West’s problem and no-one else’s. No-one else could act. Not the United Nations, paralysed by Russia’s veto power and by China’s disinclination to take on international responsibility. The BRICS club remained silent and so did the G-20. The West was faced with the first true threat to stability and peace in Europe since the end of the Cold War. And in applying sanctions against Russia, it managed the threat, even if only through awkwardly groping its way. [This guy acts like it might be over – hello? RAM]\n\n The fact that the West managed to present a united front in dealing with Russia was not the outcome of “leadership”, nor of obligations, nor of tactical alliances. Instead, it was the outcome of necessity. This, in fact, makes the solution – increasingly severe sanctions – more robust in the long term. When it was not really expected, countries felt bound by democratic values and they took action. Slowly, without knowing where it would end, they have made Putin’s Russia understand that it will pay a high price if it is to continue along its current path. With all their vital economic interests at risk, and even in the midst of opportunistic manoeuvring, Western countries bit the bullet.\n\n All too often, in the public sphere, people regret that the West did not consider a military option. [And just how do you define that? Defensive weapons to Ukraine so it could defend itself would be a good move – a needed move, a move not made continues to be a big mistake. RAM] But if it had, many more people might have been killed. The outcome would have been uncertain, and Russia would have become an even more incalculable spoiler in the future development of Eastern Europe. If at some point in the future, in another crisis, the West should consider a military option, it would do well to remember the lesson of this crisis. Level-headedness – even if only in the absence of other choices – pays.\n\n The EU’s collective action problem \n\n Of course, the crisis is far from over. Tremendous risks remain, most of all for Ukrainians. But while the Ukraine elections are encouraging for the West’s ability to cope with future problems, at the same time, the elections for the European Parliament present an opportunity to take a more critical view of the EU’s inner workings during the Ukraine crisis.\n\n The past few months have exposed two serious problems for the EU, which have the potential to turn into problems for Europe’s partners too. Under the Lisbon Treaty, European foreign policy is supposed to evolve out of the work of the European External Action Service. Where has the EEAS been? The major ideas, initiatives, and concrete measures throughout the Ukraine crisis came from member states. EU foreign policy emerged from inter-governmental co-operation, much as it did before Lisbon. This kind of process is often necessary, if only to integrate parliaments and constituencies back home. But the EEAS was created to provide impetus, to stimulate, and to initiate a coherent European foreign policy, to convince citizens in the member states. Why should citizens go out to vote for the European Parliament when they do not see the EU taking the lead in times of real crisis?\n\n A related problem is that of the EU population’s diverse views. The rightist and populist parties across the region sympathise with Putin’s Russia in many ways. The common denominator between the different parties is hostility to the EU as a supranational institution. These parties have now been elected in greater numbers to the European Parliament, gaining a quarter of the votes in some countries, such as France. They are bound to weaken the impression that European unity remains solid even when Europe’s values are under attack. The lesson from both the elections held on 25 May is that the EU can achieve success even under tremendous duress – but its ability to do so in the future may be in danger. by Anders Aslund | May 27th, 2014 | 10:16 am \n\n On May 25, Petro Poroshenko won a convincing victory in the first round of Ukraine’s free and fair presidential elections. His election could lead the way to political stability in the face of continued Russian military aggression in eastern Ukraine, but it is not sufficient to achieve that end. President-elect Poroshenko, a veteran politician and chocolate billionaire, needs to dissolve the Ukrainian parliament to hold early parliamentary elections this year in line with his election program and statements after his election. Under current law, parliamentary elections are not required until 2017.\n\n For at least five reasons, the parliament needs to be reelected.\n\n First, the fundamental problem in Ukraine is that no clear break with the old communist elite has occurred. This is the time to do so, and a fresh parliamentary election usually marks a full democratic breakthrough.\n\n Second, the current parliament was elected in October 2012 amid rampant fraud. It was Ukraine’s least free and fair election since the end of communism in 1991. Admittedly, the three democratic opposition parties gained 50 percent of the votes in the proportional part of the election, while then president Viktor Yanukovych’s Party of Regions received only 30 percent and the communists 13 percent. But Yanukovych reduced the democratic advantage first through election rules and then by purchasing and intimidating deputies to join his faction to gain a majority.\n\n Third, this parliament is rightly perceived as pervasively corrupt. The overwhelming majority of the parliamentarians are there to make money rather than to fulfill their political convictions. Therefore, any anticorruption policy needs to start with cleansing the legislature. Currently, the democratic parties rule with the support of defectors from Yanukovych’s party, which turned against the president after government forces killed protesters earlier this year. But these defectors are largely businessmen who want to protect their commercial interests, and many of them have already turned against anticorruption policies. \n\n Fourth, a new parliament is needed to reflect Ukraine’s latest democratic breakthrough. After such a major event, many people change their views. Many politicians discredit themselves, while new political stars are born. Both the alteration of popular sentiment and the rise of new politicians should be represented in the parliament as soon as possible. As a consequence, party constellations are bound to change fundamentally, and a new regime needs to have a functioning and sensible parliament. Otherwise it cannot legislate.\n\n Fifth, both Ukrainian and international experience prove the need for early parliamentary elections after a democratic breakthrough. A key reason for the utter chaos in Ukrainian economic policy from 1991 until 1994 was that the country did not dissolve its predemocratic parliament of 1990 but allowed it to linger until 1994, greatly damaging the nation. Similarly, after the Orange Revolution of 2004–05, the Orange leaders did not dissolve parliament. Instead they focused on the parliamentary elections in March 2006 rather than the immediate needs of the country. This mistake must not be repeated. \n\n A separate cautionary lesson could be drawn from the experience in Russia, where President Boris Yeltsin could have dissolved his old predemocratic parliament in November 1991 but failed to do so because he thought he had to deal with the economic crisis first. His delay led to the shoot-out of the White House in Moscow, the official building of the Russian parliament, in October 1993. Yeltsin had exhausted his options and had no choice but to dissolve the unruly and undemocratic parliament. His successor Vladimir Putin exploited the excessive concentration of power in the presidential administration to bury democracy altogether.\n\n Any country needs at least one major institution of reasonable legitimacy, either parliament or president. Until these presidential elections, the Ukrainian parliament was the most legitimate, but now the president is more so. The popular uprisings in Egypt and Libya show how awful the outcome can be if neither of these institutions is legitimate: Then, authoritarian rule returns as a supposed defense against chaos and anarchy.\n\n A parliamentary election should take place as soon as possible, in September or October this year. Poroshenko needs to act instantly, while he still possesses the full authority of his election victory. The later he acts, the more concessions to old vested interests he will be forced to make. Window on Eurasia: Moscow Patriarchate Giving Awards to Stalinists and Anti-Semites, Eggert Says Staunton, June 2 – The Moscow Patriarchate is sending a dangerous message about its own views and about what Russians should think by presenting awards to individuals who are openly Stalinist and anti-Semitic in their views, according to Konstantin Eggert, an independent Moscow journalist. In a comment to “Kommersant-FM” on Friday, Eggert said he was shocked by the decision of the Russian church hierarchy to present the Patriarchal Prize in Literature to Valery Ganichev, the head of the Union of Writers of Russia and deputy chairman of the Russian Popular Assembly (kommersant.ru/doc/2482345). Ganichev is notorious for his pro-Stalin and anti-Jewish comments, but disturbingly, Eggert says, this is hardly the first such action by the Patriarchate. Patriarch Kirill has presented awards to Aleksandr Prokhanov who has called Stalin “a new Russian saint” and to Stanislav Kunyayev, the openly anti-Semitic editor of “Nash Sovremennik.” To be sure, neither was given the prize for these specific statements or works, but the Church had to know about them, Eggert says. The same is true about Ganichev who “from the 1970s has been one of the recognized leaders of the nationalist direction in Russian literature” and whose works are infused with an anti-Semitic spirit. There can be no doubt about the trend here, the journalist says. “Too many of the nominees and laureates of the Patriarchal Prize, with only a few worthy exceptions are united by a fervent love of Stalin and just as strong hatred of the Jews, America and the West in general, of democracy and the intelligentsia.” Moreover, these honorees are given to conspiracy thinking and to support of horrific foreign leaders like the bestial “Saddam Hussein and Milosevic in the past and the cannibalistic dynasty of the Kims in North Korea today.” If anyone doubts that, he or she should watch Prokhanov’s televised panegyric to “the grotesque North Korean dictator.” Prokhanov, Kunyayev and Ganichev “have every right to their views and the dissemination” of them, Eggert says. “Let the, if they want, to long for the Stalinist boot [and] to deny the Holocaust.” But that doesn’t mean that the Russian Orthodox Church has any justification for giving them prizes. There is no way to combine the expressed values of the Church with the expressed views of Prokhanov and his like, Eggert says. “You must choose either the one or the other. The jury of the Patriarchal Prize has made its choice. And Patriarch Kirill alas has in essence supported it.” Orthodox Christians and all others of good will can only be appalled and ashamed. Window on Eurasia: Putin’s Moves in Ukraine Pushing Russia toward Disintegrtion, Portnikov Says Staunton, June 2 – By his actions in Ukraine and elsewhere, Vladimir Putin is pushing Russia toward disintegration, Vladimir Portnikov says. Indeed, he argues, the Kremlin leader has “already taken all the decisions necessary” for that to happen and to happen far more quickly than anyone expects. In an interview at the end of last week, the Ukrainian commentator says that it isn’t so much that Putin has miscalculated, although he has not made the best decisions he might have, but that the Russian president was “chosen by history itself to liquidate the state” he heads (obozrevatel.com/interview/19627-portnikov-rossiya-raspadetsya--putin-vse-neobhodimyie-resheniya-uzhe-prinyal.htm). In that respect, Portnikov continues, Putin’s elevation was “not the most successful choice because he is not a very educated man. It is possible that this process would have gone better if Russia had a leader who had greater intellectual potential ... and an understanding of strategic consequences, was not so greedy for money, and who was not so tied to his entourage.” But however that may be, he continues, Putin faces a problem that no one could have solved: “The Russian Federation is not a state, it is a fragment of the former Soviet Union which unlike other former Soviet republics never had real statehood, never had its own communit party, with the exception of he last two years of the existence of the Union and to a large extent was the nucleus of the empire itself.” Russia’s statehood after 1991 “did not undero any changes,” Portnikov says. \"Up to now, it exists as a quite strange conglomerate consisting of republics, oblasts, krays, and national districts ... and unresolved national, religious and territorial issues connected with the existence of the regions.” “Everything has remained Soviet. And the main thing for the preservation of this territory was to avoid setting precedents which would allow its disintegration.” Boris Yeltsin and his advisors understood this, but Vladimir Putin does not. The first Russian president backed the independence of the RSFSR so that autonomies inside it would have nowhere to go. That was “the correct decision,” Portnikov says, “because then in fact Tatarstan was at the point of leaving the Russian Federation as was Chechnya.” Indeed, “the entire existence of the Russian Federation [since then has been] based on the Soviet status quo of the inviolability of borders.” Indeed, “the harshness of Russia in the Chechen war was to a large extent justified by the necessity of observing this status quo and not taking any legal changes which would allow the borders of Russia to be changed.” “Having recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South Osetia and even more having carried out the annexation of Crimea, Putin has violated this order of things,” Portnikov continues, because he knows very well that “if Crimea can liberally in the course of a week change its jurisdiction then nothing will prevent declaratons of independence or a change in jurisdiction by Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Tuva, Yakutia, Buryatiya, [and] Kabardinia-Balkaria. Still more fatefully, by what he is doing in Donetsk and Luhansk, Putin is opening the door for such actions by predominantly Russian territories as well. Crimea could at least be presented as ethnically different, but the others and even more “Novorossiya” cannot possibly be described that way. They thus open “a direct path to a Urals Republic,” like the one Yeltsin worked so hard to suppress, “to a Siberian Republic” and to all other similar arrangements. Given Putin’s incautious actions, the disintegration of Russia will proceed, triggered by an economic crisis. “Russia is a territory which is held together exclusively by the common striving of the population to make use of energy resources.” If that becomes less profitable and possible, then the end will be near. Sanctions may bring that day closer, but other factors are at work, including massive corruption and diversion of earnings by Putin and his entourage into their own pockets, the Ukrainian analyst says. And once this process starts, it will move quickly, so quickly that those like Putin who believe that his deal with China will stop it miss an important detail: the Moscow-Beijing accord goes into effet only in 2018. And “today is still 2014.” Between then and now is four years, and much can and will happen. History is accelerating. In the 19th century, people looked forward “approximately a hundred years. In the early 20th, “in 50-year categories.” “Somewhere at the start of the 1970s, many experts came to the understanding that the Soviet Union would not last out the net 20-25 years.” Now, events are moving faster, and people need to think about four or five years out. Look how fast things have moved in Ukraine, he says. The same thing is going to be true of Russia. “To talk about the Chinese contrat which will go into effet only four years from now is simply funny. Five years from now, we will lie in a completely different world in which the Russian Federation in its current form won’t exist.” Moreover, the Russian Federation’s demise will have enormous consequences for its neighbors because “Russia is the main generator of instability” both for itself and for them. According to Portnikov, Moscow will focus on Kazakhstan. It won’t be able to do much while Nursultan Nazarbayev is in office, “but no one knows what will be the situation there after his departure.” If Russia does not become “a civilized state which respects its neighbors and the norms of international law” before Nazarbayev’s departure, Portnikov says, then Russian “aggression in Kazakhstan isinevitable.” And it will involve far larger forces, far more instability, “and this will lead to serious ethnic clashes in Russia’s Middle Volga.” Asked when Moscow will leave Ukraine in peace, Portnikovsays that will happen “only if the Ukrainian leadership together with that of the US and the European Union agree to the following Russian conditions:” recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, the federalization of Ukraine, state status for the Russian language, and Russian control of the gas pipeline network. “If all these conditions were to be fulfilled, that is, if Ukraine, the US and the EU capitulate before Russia, then [Moscow] will leave us in peace,” he says. Otherwise, “it will continue its destabilizing actions” in Ukraine, and those in turn will destabilize the entire region and Russia itself. Window on Eurasia: Sochi Officials Resumed Killing Homeless Animals after Olympic Journalists Left, Activist Says Staunton, June 2 – In a classic example of how international attention can restrain Russian officials and how the end of such attention frees them to resume what they were doing, an animal rights activist reports that Sochi officials have restarted their campaign to kill homeless animals since Western journalists left following the Olympiad. Tatyana Leshchenko, one of the leaders of the animal rights movement in the North Caucasus, says that international outrage in the run-up to the Olympiad forced Sochi officials to suspend the killing but “when all the journalists left,” they resumed it and on an even greater scale (rosbalt.ru/federal/2014/05/31/1274056.html). Her comments come as the Russian Federal Assembly is discussing a bill that would provide some additional protections for animals. Leshchenko says that the new law must focus on promoting sterilization of pets. Otherwise, however often officials wipe out homeless animals, new ones will appear. The problem won’t go away. And these programs are by their nature cruel, she continues. In Sochi since the Olympics, a private firm has been killing 300 to 500 homeless animals each month and collecting a bounty of “about a thousand rubles” (30 US dollars) for each paid for out of taxes collected from the population. “What is happening now, especially in the private sector is unbearable,” Leshchenko continues. Those who are engaged in the killings are making profits, and the animals are suffering. And the authorities are not promoting sterilization or punishing those who toss animals into the streets. Russian laws against animal cruelty “do not work at all,” she says. People get a dog or cat and then throw it in the street when they get tired of it “like an old coat.” And nothing happens. Equally unfortunately, these laws allow anyone to declare an animal aggressive and dangerous, something that opens the way to abuse and mistreatment. Shelters help but they are not by themselves the answer, Leshchenko insists. In Sochi during the Olympics, one was set up with the help of a priva",

in the wake of the downing of flight mh17 its a joke and they will do nothing and i predicted they would do nothing mr mccain told the telegraph they will continue to do nothing until the day they become independent of russian energy until then they will talk mr mccain said in the face of european inaction it would be helpful for britain to move ahead unilaterally with banking sanctions but he

and gas fields if moscow does not help to defuse the ukraine crisis eu energy commissioner guenther oettinger said according to reuters at a news conference he said if they dont try for peace in the east of ukraine if they dont decisively try to do something to prevent escalation then there is no reason for us to help promote the growth of their industry and develop new resources for gas and oil

Join us again in the orning for the latest developments and take a moment to read Harriet Alexander 's report from Eindhoven, where the first of the bodies have now arrived in the Netherlands:\n\nOut of the carnage, chaos and unspeakable horror finally came a moment of calm.\n\nA small dot appeared in the cloudless blue sky above the Dutch city of Eindhoven, gradually getting larger as the first plane carrying victims of last week's Malaysia Airlines disaster came in to land.\n\nOn it were 16 bodies, carried aboard the Hercules C-130 which just a few hours earlier had set off from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.\n\nThen came a second plane, an Australian Boeing C-17, which touched down carrying a further 24 corpses.\n\nFinally, the victims of this awful tragedy were coming home.\n\n00.20 Earlier tonight, the Malaysian flag at the parade of nations ahead of the Commonwelath Games in Glasgow was borne at half mast, as mark of respect to those who lost their lives in Ukraine:\n\n23.50 The recovered cockpit voice recorder from MH17 is in good condition, the UN civil aviation body has confirmed.\n\nAdding to earlier, similar positive assessment from the Dutch Safety Board (OVV) (17.35) the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization, which is helping Ukrainian authorities probe the crash, said in a statement that the plane's digital flight data recorder was still being examined.\n\n23.10 As a moving and solemn ceremony for the first victims returned to the Netherlands snaked its way through he streets of Amsterdam, the Dutch government confirmed the same respect will be paid when the next two more planeloads of victims are flown on Thursday to Eindhoven.\n\n21.30 Thousands of people in Amsterdam dressed in white marched solemnly along the city's canals in memory of the 298 people who died aboard flight MH17, most of them Dutch, Reuters report.\n\nThe memorial march came on a national day of mourning for the Netherlands, which lost 193 citizens when the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was shot down over Ukraine last week.\n\n\"It's important to come together, to show that we're together, that we share the pain of our families and friends,\" said Leon, 35, wearing a white T-shirt.\n\n\"And it's important for everyone to wear white, the colour of hope, which means that we're looking to the future,\" he said.\n\nThe marchers released hundreds of white balloons into the sky as night fell in Amsterdam.\n\n21.04 NATO continues to see evidence of weapons being moved into Ukraine from Russia since the downing of a Malaysian airliner in eastern Ukraine last week, a NATO military officer said, according to Reuters.\n\nWe have noted an increase in the amount of weapons being transferred from Russia to Ukraine in the last several weeks. We continue to see evidence of the movement of weapons into Ukraine from Russia since the downing of (Malaysia Airlines flight) MH17, which is a cause for concern,\" the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.\n\nThe European Union has said Russia must stop the flow of weapons across the border or face tougher sanctions.\n\n20.41 According to BBC's East Africa correspondent, Gabriel Gatehouse, Mr Khodakovsky denies the details of the Reuters report.\n\nTwitter: Gabriel Gatehouse - I just spoke to Alexander Khodakovsky. Denies all the details in the @ReutersWorld story (http://t.co/Z5Bb57hxK6) Says \"misunderstood\" Odd\n\n20.38 A Nato military officer has told Reuters the organisation continues to see evidence of movement of weapons into Ukraine from Russia since the crash.\n\n20.20 European Union ambassadors will debate proposals tomorrow on restricting Russian access to Europe's capital markets and defence and energy technology but are not expected to make a quick decision, Reuters reports.\n\nAmbassadors from the 28 EU nations are expected to agree on Thursday to add the names of some Russian companies that are helping to undermine Ukraine's sovereignty to the bloc's sanctions list, using new expanded criteria.\n\nBut they will probably need more time to agree to go beyond the asset freezes so far imposed by the EU and restrict Russia's access to Europe's financial markets and technology.\n\n20.07 Thousands have joined a silent march in Amsterdam in memory of those killed in the plane crash.\n\nTwitter: Just Hovens Greve - Very impressive;thousands join a silent march for #MH17 victims in #amsterdam. Most are dressed in white. http://t.co/ZA3HrnhFj6\n\n\"I did not say anything of the sort Reuters reported, and I have a recording of the conversation,\" Russia's RIA Novosti state news agency reported, quoting a source within Mr Khodakovsky's circle who it said had heard him utter these words.\n\n19.50 Earlier we reported on a Reuters exclusive in which Ukrainian rebel leader Alexander Khodakovsky, commander of the Vostok Battalion, acknowledged for the first time since the airliner was brought down in eastern Ukraine the rebels did possess the BUK missile system.\n\nHowever, Roland Oliphant in Donetsk tweeted this just now.\n\nTwitter: Roland Oliphant - Ah, according to RIA, he retracts. \"I said nothing of the sort and I have a recording.\"\n\nIt seems Mr Khodakovsky denies he made those remarks.\n\n19.24 Monitors from the European security body OSCE and Malaysian inspectors found parts of the fuselage of the downed Malaysian flight MH17 with \"significant puncture marks\", the OSCE said according to AFP.\n\n\"Some of the materials we saw and have photographed, feature significant puncture marks to the fuselage, almost a piercing mark,\" said Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe's special mission to Ukraine.\n\nThese parts \"were looked at by the Malaysians and I can say that these parts were of very great interest to them,\" he said, adding that the team had also spotted human remains still lying at the crash site.\n\n19.21 OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media Dunja Mijatović condemned the abduction of freelance journalist Anton Skiba in Donetsk and called for his immediate release.\n\nSkiba was abducted on 22 July by armed separatists at a hotel in Donetsk. He had been assisting a CNN film crew. His current whereabouts are unknown.\n\n19.18 A candlelit procession through Amsterdam is planned, with hundreds of people expected to turn up, wearing white to show their sympathy, reports Harriet Alexander.\n\n19.16 Russian oligarchs who are close to Vladimir Putin have two weeks to get their cash out of Britain before sanctions are imposed, it has emerged, reports Christopher Hope and Bruno Waterfield in Brussels.\n\nEuropean Union officials started on Tuesday to prepare the list of businessmen and Moscow officials who will be targeted by the sanctions.\n\nPhilip Hammond, the Foreign Secretary, has made clear the Britain’s desperation to take action at those close to Mr Putin’s regime, saying \"the cronies of Mr Putin and his clique in the Kremlin are the people who have to bear the pressure\".\n\nHowever, British sources disclosed that it will not be until the end of the month that all EU countries will have prepared their lists of individuals to be hit with the sanctions.\n\nThe length of time before any action against these so-called Putin cronies will fuel concerns that they can withdraw their money before sanctions are imposed.\n\n18.53 You can listen to Raf Sanchez's interview with John McCain in which the senator criticises the EU's limited sanctions on Russia.\n\n18.47 In a show of unity a day after an ally of President Vladimir Putin warned Russia's anti-Western rhetoric could derail the economy, ministers said growth had not been dampened by the sanctions which include measures against some major companies, Reuters reports.\n\n\"The sanctions in their current format don't have a macroeconomic effect,\" Andrei Belousov, the Kremlin's top economic adviser, told journalists.\n\n\"My assessment is that we're in the vicinity of 1 percent (gross domestic product growth) and will stay there until the end of the year.\"\n\nTrade Minister Denis Manturov said the measures by the West could not drive Russia into the isolation of Soviet times.\n\n\"What sanctions? A holy place is never empty: if one market closes, another opens,\" he told journalists. \"What's happening today is peanuts compared to what was then.\"\n\n18.44 Despite the push for sanctions and a review of outstanding arms deals reported on below, David Cameron will play tennis with a former ally of Vladimir Putin after the Conservatives said they will keep a £116,000 donation raised a dinner, reports Christopher Hope.\n\nThe Prime Minister rejected calls to pay back a £160,000 donation from the Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former member of President Putin’s government in the early part of the last decade.\n\nMr Cameron said he would not accept money from a “Putin crony” but Mrs Chernukhin’s husband Vladimir “certainly wasn’t that”.\n\n18.20 Britain will review its outstanding arms deals with Russia, David Cameron has pledged as the MPs called on the Government to clarify its position on weapons sales, reports The Telegraph's Senior Political Correspondent, Christopher Hope.\n\nThe news came after a committee of MPs disclosed that more than 200 licences to sell British weapons to Russia are still in place.\n\nMr Cameron said he would act “very swiftly” if British arms exports to Russia were being deployed against Ukraine but insisted an embargo had not been breached.\n\nEarlier, Michael Fallon, the new defence secretary, said that Britain does not export any weapons to Russia “that could be used for internal repression”.\n\nMr Fallon said the UK has one of the strictest arms sales policies in the world and has suspended all export licenses to Russia as a result of the Ukraine crisis.\n\n“We do not export arms to the Russian armed forces or any equipment that could be used for internal repression - that’s always been absolutely standing policy.\n\n18.11 Europe's tepid sanctions on Russia are \"a joke\" that will only encourage further aggression from Vladimir Putin, John McCain said, reports Raf Sanchez.\n\nThe Republican senator, who has been a leading voice for strong action against Moscow, led a chorus of American anger over Europe's limited sanctions in the wake of the downing of Flight MH17.\n\n\"It's a joke and they will do nothing and I predicted they would do nothing,\" Mr McCain told The Telegraph. \"They will continue to do nothing until the day they become independent of Russian energy. Until then they will talk.\"\n\nMr McCain said in the face of European inaction it would be helpful for Britain to move ahead unilaterally with banking sanctions but he doubted the British government had the resolve.\n\n\"It would help but even they're not going to do that because they want all that money into London,\" he said.\n\nThe former presidential contender called Mr Putin \"a KGB thug\" who was was using his influence with the separatists to \"call the shots\" in eastern Ukraine.\n\n18.07 In an interview with Reuters, Ukrainian rebel leader Alexander Khodakovsky, commander of the Vostok Battalion, acknowledged for the first time since the airliner was brought down in eastern Ukraine the rebels did possess the BUK missile system.\n\nHe also indicated the BUK may have originated in Russia and could have been sent back to remove proof of its presence.\n\nKhodakovsky blamed the Kiev authorities for provoking what may have been the missile strike that destroyed the doomed airliner, saying Kiev had deliberately launched air strikes in the area, knowing the missiles were in place.\n\n\"I knew that a BUK came from Luhansk. At the time I was told that a BUK from Luhansk was coming under the flag of the LNR,\" he said, referring to the Luhansk People's Republic, the main rebel group operating in Luhansk, one of two rebel provinces along with Donetsk, the province where the crash took place.\n\nMr Khodakovsky was not immediately available to verify the Reuters report.\n\n17.48 Bruno Waterfield explains what sanctions could be agreed tomorrow and which country wants what.\n\nEU sanctions set for 'capital markets, defence, dual use goods & sensitive technology' but not oil & gas sector.\n\nBritain, Sweden and a group of eastern European countries pushed hard for an immediate arms embargo at Tuesday’s meeting of EU foreign ministers.\n\nIt was a measure that made sense as the Malaysia Airlines plane was hit by a Russian supplied SA-11 missile fired from territory in East Ukraine controlled by separatists supported by Russia.\n\nThe move was blocked by France.\n\n17.44 The Dutch Safety Board added: \"The Cockpit Voice Recorder was damaged but the part that contains the data was intact. Nor was there any evidence or indication that (it) had been manipulated.\"\n\n\"Despite the fact that evidence and traces have been damaged or lost, the board expects it will be able to gather sufficient relevant information from the crash site.\"\n\n17.35 The Dutch Safety Board (OVV) said it would now work on assessing the information it had downloaded from the black box, a process which would need more time.\n\nIt said examination of the airliner's other black box, the Flight Data Recorder, would start on Thursday, Reuters reports.\n\n17.28 Yesterday's meeting of EU foreign ministers suggested there could be some more sanctions on individuals linked to Russia involving asset freezes and visa bans but they failed to agree further economic sanctions and ask the 28-nation executive to make a decision.\n\nAmidst this debate over how to deal with Russia, there has also been accusations of hypocrisy made by the French against the British and vice versa.\n\nNow AFP report that experts have said the Anglo-French dispute would blow over, but warned it was a symptom of a wider malaise in the European Union as all 28 nations insist the burden of sanctions against Russia must be equally shared.\n\nWe can see tensions in the EU over sanctions, which are inevitable given each country has a different relationship with Russia,\" Sarah Lain, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think-tank in London, said.\n\n\"France is really against breaking this contract, it would harm French interests a lot more than Russian interests. Then the British parliamentary report has drawn attention to the fact that France is not the only one in Europe who has a defence relationship with Moscow.\"\n\n17.21 The investigators said: \"The cockpit voice recorder was damaged but the memory module was intact. Furthermore no evidence or indications of manipulation of the cockpit voice recorder was found.\" The black boxes are currently being analysed in the UK at Farnborough, Hampshire.\n\n17.11 Dutch air accident investigators say they have not found any evidence that one of the plane's black boxes were tampered with, according to Reuters.\n\n17.09 Readers can watch the moving return of 40 of the victims at Eindhoven airport earlier today where more than 1000 relatives and dignitaries including the Dutch PM attended to pay their respect.\n\n17.00 We have this short dispatch from Harriet Alexander describing the scene when the coffins arrived.\n\nApplause broke out from the 1,000 family members and dignitaries who had gathered on the tarmac as the last of the 40 hearses pulled away from Eindhoven airport.\n\nThe convoy has now begun its journey 80 miles north west to Hilversum, where behind closed doors on the military base forensic identification will be carried out.\n\nThe recorders, salvaged from the wreckage of the plane in eastern Ukraine, were delivered to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch headquarters in Farnborough, Hampshire, by Dutch experts.\n\nAAIB experts began the task of extracting information from the cockpit voice recorder, which should give them hours of pilots' conversations, as well as the contents of the flight data recorder.\n\nThe AAIB, a branch of the Department for Transport, is \"taking the data off and feeding that into the international investigation,\" a DfT spokesman told AFP.\n\n\"They expect it to take up to 24 hours per box. It may be less, it may be more if they find damage to the boxes, for example.\n\n\"It's under way already.\"\n\nThe recorders will be worked on one box at a time.\n\n16.32 Earlier today, Downing Street had the Union flag and the Dutch flag at half mast out of respect for the MH17 victims ahead of the arrival of 40 bodies at Eindhoven airport.\n\n16.30 In a statement, the Dutch Safety Board said it would coordinate a team of 24 investigators from Ukraine, Malaysia, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia and the International Civil Aviation Organisation.\n\nIt said four Dutch investigators were operating in Ukraine.\n\n16.16 Barry Sweeney, the father of British victim and football fan Liam Sweeney, told ITV News the grieving families “need closure” through the return of the victims’ bodies and their burials.\n\nIn an emotional interview before the planes arrived, he said: \"We need closure. We need to see our children. All the families, the Mams, the Dads, brothers, sisters, we need them back here. We need closure so they can be buried very very soon.”\n\n16.05 The International Committee of the Red Cross considers Ukraine to be in a state of civil war, AFP reports.\n\n16.00 Chancellor Angela Merkel demanded the EU impose rapid sanctions including economic penalties against Russia on Wednesday.\n\nThe move underlines Germany’s growing exasperation with President Vladimir Putin’s failure to investigate the shooting down of flight MH17, Tony Paterson reports.\n\nBerlin government spokesman Georg Streiter told reporters that Mrs Merkel considered that rapid EU sanctions against Russia were necessary because Moscow had shown no interest in investigating the background to the air disaster.\n\nGovernment sources said the German leader wanted the initial EU economic sanctions to be imposed against the first Russian firms on Thursday.\n\nGermany maintains that the Russian secret service agents are running the pro-Russian separatist groups in the Ukraine and that Moscow has failed to use its influence to curb their actions\n\n“We are unable to conclude that the Kremlin is interested in a thorough inquiry, “said Mr Streiter.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Berlin Foreign Ministry added; “ Russia has promised a great deal but failed to deliver”. She said Berlin’s message to Moscow was “ So far but no further”.\n\n15.55 In the statement from the Ukrainian foreign ministry, Kiev says \"the jet fighters of the Ukrainian Armed Forces were not in the airspace before, at and immediately after the crash of the Malaysian civilian aircraft\".\n\n\"Since the start of the CTO, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have never used any anti-aircraft missiles.\"\n\n15.50 The Dutch Safety Board is also reviewing decision-making processes concerning flight routes and availability of passenger lists, Reuters reports.\n\n15.48 The hearses are now on their way to Hilversum with a police escort.\n\n15.46 AFP is reporting that the missiles that took down two Ukrainian fighter jets in the volatile east of the former Soviet state were fired from Russia, Ukraine's National and Security Council said.\n\n\"According to preliminary information, the rockets were launched from Russian territory,\" the council said in a statement, adding the Su-25 jets were flying at an altitude of 5,200 metres.\n\n15.45 In a statement, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said:\n\nOn July 21, search operations at the crash site were fully completed. The units of the state service on emergencies of Ukraine discovered 282 dead bodies and 87 fragments that belonged to 16 other bodies.\n\nInternational experts’ examination of the crash site is complicated by the fact that Russian military experts under the guise of civilians have already inspected the crash area.\n\n15.43 German Chancellor Angela Merkel is calling for rapid imposition of sanctions against Russia including economic, reports Tony Paterson in Berlin.\n\nIn a statement, the German foreign ministry said: \"We've had enough.\"\n\n15.42 Professor David Royds, a forensic expert from Australia's University of Canberra, said that the victims not immediately killed when flight MH17 would not have suffered, reports Bruno Waterfield.\n\n\"Flying at more than 10km above the ground, the mid-air explosion would have caused the cabin temperature to drop to minus 50C with a sudden drop of air pressure and loss of oxygen,” he said.\n\n“That extremely cold environment would have rendered the passengers unconscious within seconds. It’s very unlikely the passengers would have suffered, there would have been no time to worry.”\n\n15.38 The bodies continue to be taken to the hearses where they will then go to Hilversum to start the formal identification process.\n\n15.36 The Dutch Safety Board has said its investigators have not been able to visit the crash side because their safety is not guaranteed but the team is investigating whether the aircraft's boxes may have been manipulated, Reuters reports.\n\n15.33 Meanwhile, as the bodies are taken to the hearses, the Dutch Safety Board says it has taken formal charge of the MH17 crash investigation.\n\nAccording to Reuters an international team of 24 will investigate the crash.\n\n15.27 The first of the 40 bodies has just been placed inside the hearse, ready to take it from Eindoven to Hilversum for identification and eventual repatriation, Harriet Alexander reports.\n\nThe sight of the planes coming finally to land was immensely moving. The planes taxied to a position in front of where the King, Queen, Prime Minister and relatives were waiting.\n\nWe can't see them from here - screens have been put up - but we are told around 1,000 family members are there.\n\nThe last post was played and the whole airfield fell silent.\n\nThen the military personnel began carrying the coffins from the planes to the awaiting hearses.\n\nIt has been a dignified end to a chaotic and traumatic journey.\n\n15.24 The investigation will be undertaken by individuals from many countries including the UK, Malaysia, The Netherlands and others. Sky News report the families of two British victims are also at Eindhoven airport.\n\n15.17 As the coffins are taken to each hearse, Harriet Alexander reports from Eindhoven airport. The first victim's body has been unloaded onto the hearse.\n\n15.15 The first of the coffins is being carried out and taken towards the hearse.\n\n15.12 The hearses are arriving to take the bodies of the victims one by one to Hilversum.\n\n15.09 The families are kept away from the cameras, and a screen to ensure they can grieve in private, Sky News says.\n\n15.07 There is now a minute's silence after the Last Post was played. Flags fly at half-mast to honour the victims at Eindhoven airport.\n\nPassengers observe a one-minute of silence in remembrance of the victims of the crash at Schiphol airport.\n\n15.04 The 40 victims will be taken to Hilversum, a military medical facility, where they will work to formally identify the remains. This is a process which the Dutch PM has said could take weeks or even months.\n\nThe UK is sending out nine disaster victim identification personnel to help with the process, according to Sky News.\n\n15.01 Sky News has said more than 1000 relatives are also at the airport to greet the arrival of the bodies, which they have been waiting for for several days.\n\n15.00 Those greeting the arrival of the planes including the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as well as King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima.\n\nThis is an important moment for the nation which lost 193 of its citizens in the crash last week.\n\n14.58 The Dutch Hercules C-130 plane landed first followed shortly by the Australian Boeing C-17 plane. Five bodies will be carried out at a time from the planes, according to the reports.\n\n14.54 Dignitaries are making their way to the tarmac to take a seat for the last post and there will be a minute's silence at 4pm local time (3pm in the UK).\n\nTrains and planes will stop nationwide before bodies are unloaded and each coffin is put into a hearse - one coffin per car, Harriet Alexander reports.\n\nBells are rung across The Netherlands and at the airport to remember the victims. Today is a day of national morning in the country.\n\n14.50 The second plane has touched down at the airport, in which there are 24 bodies, according to Sky News.\n\n14.50 One of the planes carrying some of the victims of the plane crash has safely arrived at Eindhoven airport. The second plane is due to arrive very shortly.\n\nThere are only 40 bodies on these planes, according to Sky News, and there will be more on their way later in the week.\n\n14.45 Lodewijk Hekking, spokesman for the Ministry of Security and Justice, has just told Harriet Alexander and other reporters at Eindhoven airport that the two planes are currently mid air en route from Ukraine, and are expected to land at 15.50.\n\nThey are carrying 40 bodies, whose nationalities are unknown.\n\nThere will be a minute's silence at 4pm. Trains and planes will stop nationwide.\n\nThe bodies will then be unloaded and each coffin put into a hearse - one coffin per car - to be driven to Hilversum with a police escort around the hearse convoy.\n\nOut on the tarmac, hundreds of cameras await. The flags - representing the countries which lost citizens - are flying at half mast.\n\n14.32 Russia has accused Ukraine of manipulating data held by its air traffic authorities concerning the crash, according to AFP. Russian foreign ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said in a statement:\n\nAccording to the latest information, Ukrainian security forces, without notifying international organisations, are engaged in some secret work with the databases and personnel of Ukrainian air traffic services, both military and civilian.\n\n\"That clearly goes against the goal of an objective and unbiased investigation.\"\n\nInstead of helping the probe into the crash in eastern Ukraine that killed all 298 people on board of the Boeing 777, Kiev is \"planting absurd, unfounded accusations against Russia on a daily, hourly basis\".\n\n14.24 As tensions and emotions run high in the Netherlands, Pieter Broertjes, the mayor of the city of Hilversum, called for Vladimir Putin's daughter to be deported from the Netherlands this morning, according to the Guardian.\n\nIn a radio interview, he said Maria Putin, 29, who lives with her Dutch boyfriend in Voorschoten should be thrown out of the country.\n\nBut the mayor apologised on Twitter for his remarks, describing them as \"not wise\" but said \"they stemmed from a feeling of helplessness that many will recognise\".\n\nIt comes after De Telegraaf reported that Ukrainian Twitter users were calling for a peaceful protest where she lived. Putin has two daughters, Maria and Yekaterina, whom the Guardian reports have never been officially photographed as adults.\n\n14.10 Reverse gas flows from the European Union to Ukraine had fallen because of opposition from Russian gas producer Gazprom, Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuri Prodan said.\n\nUkraine - which consumes around 50 billion cubic metres of gas annually - has increased its efforts to secure more gas from the European Union after Gazprom raised prices for its supplies in a dispute.\n\n\"Reverse gas supplies are reduced at present. This is linked to certain actions by Gazprom,\" Prodan told Reuters and other reporters, adding Ukraine first saw a decrease two weeks ago.\n\n14.04 Reuters report the International Committee of the Red Cross said all sides in Ukraine's civil war must protect civilians and take what measures they can to search for those killed on the downed Malaysian airliner and ensure their bodies are returned to their families,\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the ICRC said international law required warring parties to distinguish between military targets and civilian objects and to protect the civilian population, the wounded, former combatants and detainees.\n\n\"These rules and principles apply to all parties to the non-international armed conflict in Ukraine, and impose restrictions on the means and methods of warfare that they may use,\" ICRC director of operations Dominik Stilhart said.\n\n14.02 The EU should not give Russia technical help to develop Arctic oil and gas fields if Moscow does not help to defuse the Ukraine crisis, EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said, according to Reuters. At a news conference he said:\n\n\"If they don't try for peace in the east of Ukraine ... If they don't decisively try to do something to prevent escalation, then there is no reason for us to help promote the growth of their industry and develop new resources for gas and oil and therefore to put this equipment on the list of sanctions.\n\n\"The Russians see offshore oil and gas in the Arctic, for example, as a good potential for the future. But this can only be developed by hardware and software from the West, by drills and ... equipment that their industry cannot supply.\"\n\n13.49 Pro-Russian rebels shot down two Ukrainian fighter jets in eastern Ukraine today just days after the downing of Flight MH17, a Ukrainian military spokesman told AFP.\n\n\"Two Sukhoi Ukrainian fighter jets have been shot down. The fate of the pilots is not known,\" spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky said, adding the planes were brought down some 25 kilometres (16 miles) from the crash site of MH17.\n\nBut a second military spokesman said the jets had been downed at a different location by rockets fired by insurgents. The two pilots managed to parachute out, he said.\n\n\"Today in the south of the Lugansk region close to the village of Dmytrivka, pro-Russian fighters shot two Su-25 jets from a missile system,\" spokesman Vladislav Seleznev said.\n\n\"The pilots took evasive action ... but the planes were hit,\" he said.\n\n13.46 In a sign of how far Germany's approach to sanctions has shifted since the downing of MH17, Justin Huggler reports on what German politicians have said recently.\n\n\"The economic view is not the decisive factor,\" Angela Merkel's vice-chancellor and economics minister Sigmar Gabriel said.\n\nUntil now Germany has been wary of the effect harsher sanctions against Russia may have on its own economy.\n\nMr Gabriel said he now expects tougher sanctions to be imposed, and that the Russian economy will \"be affected to a much greater extent than the European\".\n\nFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports it is possible even major Russian energy companies like Gazprom, which supplies around 25 per cent of the EU's gas, could be targeted by new sanctions.\n\n\"The Europeans are running late and have almost created a vacuum,\" said the chairman of the Budestag's foreign affairs committee, Norbert Röttgen.\n\n13.44 Linda Wouters, from Eindhoven, had organised a collection among her colleagues at an office delivery firm to buy a large bouquet for the site.\n\n\"I'm a very emotional person and I've been feeling so sad about this tragedy,\" she said.\n\n\"This feels like the right thing to do.\n\n13.40 More from Harriet Alexander at Eindhoven airport where one woman laid flowers in memory of her boyfriend's aunt, Ninik Yuriane, who died in the crash.\n\n\"She was always laughing,\" she said, after laying a single pink rose by the entrance to the base.\n\nMrs Yuriane, 75, was flying to Kuala Lumpur to visit her mother, who lived in Asia.\n\n\"She was very kind, very sweet. She was very loved.\"\n\nAnd she said that the ceremony, to be held at 4pm today with the King and Queen, was welcomed.\n\n\"It's good to know that we're not alone,\" she said.\n\n13.30 Harriet Alexander has spoken to individuals laying floral tributes at Eindhoven airport in memory of those killed in the crash and where the bodies are due to arrive at 4pm local time.\n\nOutside the gates of Eindhoven airport, beneath an old military display plane painted in the Dutch colours, people had begun laying piles of flowers.\n\n\"It was the only thing I could think of doing to show my sympathy and support,\" said Lisette Kaptein, 42, from Eindhoven.\n\n\"I travel a lot too, and so this could easily have been me.\"\n\n13.25 Leading German politicians have called for Russia to be stripped of hosting the next football World Cup in response to the shooting down of Flight MH17, reports Justin Huggler in Berlin.\n\nRussia is due to host the Fifa World Cup in 2018, but in the home of reigning world champions Germany there are growing calls for the competition to be moved as punishment for Vladimir Putin’s role in the downing of the airliner.\n\n“If President Putin doesn’t back down and continues to fuel the crisis, the taboo must end on removing the World Cup from Russia in 2018,” the domestic policy spokesman of Angela Merkel’s CDU party group in parliament, Stephan Mayer, said.\n\nThe party group’s vice-chairman, Michael Fuchs, suggested the competition could be held jointly in Germany, France and Italy instead.\n\n“If Putin does not become actively involved in the investigation of the plane crash, the Football World Cup 2018 in Russia is unimaginable,” said Peter Beuth, the Hesse interior minister, who chairs the conference of sports ministers from Germany’s various states.\n\n“Firstly, the safety of players and fans cannot be gauranteed” in Russia, said Bernd Fabritius, an MP. “And secondly, a country that behaves like a rogue state should not be rewarded with such an international media event.”\n\n13.09 Germany’s press has reacted furiously to EU leaders’ failure to announce tough sanctions on Russia yesterday – quite a role reversal from the country that only a few months ago was seen as chief opponent of harsher measures against Vladimir Putin, reports Justin Huggler in Berlin.\n\n“Is the EU only for outrageous inaction?” the mass-market tabloid Bild asks in its headline, adding “A Russian rocket kills 298 people – yet the EU bows to Putin”.\n\n“Outrage yes, no consequences” is the headline on Spiegel’s website.\n\nSüddeustche Zeitung runs a scathing comment piece headlines “Threaten, threaten, but do nothing”, which lambasts French president Francois Hollande for going ahead with the sale of a Mistral warship to Russia: “The French president makes his country ridiculous and the EU with it”.\n\n12.55 The jets were Sukhoi-25 fighters, and were shot down at 1.30pm local time (11.30am UK) on Wednesday, according to Ukraine's defence ministry.\n\nThe planes are believed to have been carrying up to two crew members each, according to defence ministry spokesman Oleksiy Dmitrashkovsky.\n\n12.46 Pro-Russian rebels have shot down two Ukrainian fighter jets, according to a Ukrainian military spokesman.\n\nThe two planes were down near Savur Moglia in eastern Ukraine, Reuters reported.\n\nSavur Moglia is in the Shakhtars'k region, east of the city of Donetsk.\n\n12.33 Two Ukrainian fighter jets have reportedly been shot down in the east of Ukraine, according to military sources. More details to follow\n\n12.10 More details on the black boxes' arrival in the UK from AFP:\n\nAAIB experts were set to go through the information from the cockpit voice recorder, which should give them hours of pilots' conversations, as well as study the contents of the flight data recorder.\n\nIt is thought the AAIB will be able to send details of their findings to the Dutch authorities within 24 hours - giving experts in the Netherlands further information about the doomed Boeing 777 jet's last moments.\n\n11.30 The first plane to leave Kharkiv this morning carried 16 coffins. A second transporter will carry a further 24 later this afternoon. Dutch officials have said the transfer of victims' bodies to the Netherlands may not be complete until Friday.\n\n\n\nFour coffins with the remains of victims of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 are carried to a military plane in Kharkiv (EPA)\n\n11.19 Boris Johnson has responded to criticism over a £160,000 tennis match paid for by the wife of Russian billionaire, a former finance minister of Vladimir Putin.\n\nBoris Johnson and David Cameron will pull out of the match with the Russian “geezer” if he turns out to be one of Vladimir Putin’s cronies, Mr Johnson has pledged.\n\nLabour have demanded that the Conservative party return thousands of pounds in donations from Russian oligarchs.\n\nThey have questioned the Prime Minister’s intention to go ahead with the match, auctioned off to the wife of Vladimir Chernukhin, Vladimir Putin’s former deputy finance minister.\n\nMr Johnson told Sky News: ““I think you’ve got to do stuff that actually hits Putin and his government where it hurts, make a real difference to their attitude.\n\n“They have volunteered me to play tennis with some geezer and it is very, very important that full checks are carried out to make sure that this is not somebody who is an intimate of Putin or a crony, and we are doing that at the moment.”\n\nThe criticism comes amid calls for tougher sanctions on Russia following the MH17 disaster, especially Vladimir Putin's \"cronies\" and \"oligarchs\", from the prime minister (see 10.47).\n\nMoscow has been blamed for arming pro-Russian separatists who are thought to have shot down the plane.\n\n11.08 Ben Farmer has filed this dispatch from Kharkiv airport, where the first 16 coffins have been loaded onto the first flight home.\n\nA second plane is expected to follow shortly:\n\nAfter days of chaos and disrespect for the victims of flight MH17, at last a moment of dignity.\n\nCarried on the shoulders of an honour guard of Ukrainian troops, four plain coffins were symbolically loaded onto a Dutch military Hercules transporter for another leg of the long journey to their families.\n\nThe bodies of the Malaysia Airlines crash have faced neglect, disrespect and even reportedly looting, but this morning the Ukrainian government was determined to give them a dignified ceremony.\n\n\n\nFour coffins with the remains of victima of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 are carried to a military plane during a ceremony on the airport of Kharkiv, Ukraine (DAVE HUNT/EPA)\n\n“I am not sure if the people who fired the missile know anything about dignity or the cost of human life,” Volodymyr Groysman, the country’s deputy prime minister told a small crowd at Kharkiv airport.\n\nThe 298 passengers and crew killed on the Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur flight had been “dreaming about their holiday destinations, but the flight was downed in peacetime over the territory of Ukraine,” he said.\n\n“I am absolutely sure and I want to assure you we will do everything we can in order to find those responsible.\n\n“Sharing our common grief, we absolutely assure you that those people guilty of this terrorist act will be punished.”\n\nMr Groysman spoke on the tarmac of Kharkiv airport as representatives and ambassadors from the affected nations, including Holland, Malaysia, Australia and Britain, watched the first remains loaded onto the aircraft.\n\nFull dispatch: First bodies of victims flown to Netherlands\n\n10.55 Ministers have been kept in the dark about arms sales to dictatorships, a new parliamentary report has found as it emerged that hundreds of weapons shipments to Russians were approved by the Government despite an embargo in the wake of the Crimean annexation. Matthew Holehouse reports:\n\nA report by MPs found that of 285 export licences to Russia, worth a total of £131 million, just 34 have been cancelled under a promise by William Hague in March to end any licences that could be used by the Russian military or state agencies to destabilise Ukraine.\n\nDowning Street insisted that none of the remaining licences permitted exports to the Russian military, and said they could include sporting rifles.\n\nBut the licences that British manufacturers and brokers were allowed to keep included weapons sights, sniper rifles, bomb-proof suits, unmanned aerial vehicles, military helicopter components and cryptographic equipment, the MPs claimed.\n\nA shipment of surface to air missile components that was not cancelled was destined for the Brazilian navy that has permission to dock in Russian ports, the Department for Business said.\n\n10.47 David Cameron has dismissed criticism that the sanctions agreed by EU leaders yesterday were too soft, saying that they have already damaged the Russian economy. The Telegraph's Steven Swinford reports:\n\nSpeaking in Scotland, Mr Cameron said: \"There was some progress made in terms of identifying more of the cronies and oligarchs that need to have travel bans and asset freezes put on them. It does affect him [Putin] directly.\n\n\"The effect of the sanctions has cut the Russian growth rate from 3 per cent to almost zero per cent. It has seen a reduction in the Russian stock market, a reduction in the rouble. The pressure is telling but we need to do more.\"\n\nHe said that Europe made \"good progress\" in Brussels yesterday. He said: \"I think we have made some good progress. The sanctions are really in respect of the broader picture which it to me what caused the downing of this jet was - the fact Russians were allowing weapons and support to the separatists in the Ukraine. They were denying the integrity of a modern European state. I don't think Europe can stand idly by.\"\n\n10.28 The black boxes from MH17 have been delivered to Britain for expert analysis, the UK government has said. AFP reports:\n\nThe recorders have been delivered to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch headquarters in Farnborough, southwest of London.\n\n\"We can confirm that the two black boxes from MH17 have been delivered by the Dutch Safety Board to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch at Farnborough for download,\" a Department for Transport spokeswoman told AFP.\n\n10.06 Bill Clinton has paid tribute to the HIV researchers and campaigners who died aboard MH17, telling a global AIDS summit in Australia that the world must take a firm stand against those responsible. Jonathan Pearlman reports:\n\nThe former United States president painted a stark contrast between the brutality of those who attacked the Malaysia Airlines plane and the pioneering work of AIDS researcher Joep Lange and his wife and four other campaigners who were aboard.\n\n\"He [Dr Lange] and the five other colleagues we lost lived lives which are overpowering in their contribution to a shared future,\" Mr Clinton told the summit in Melbourne.\n\n\"Those who shot them down and who provided the means to do so represent the other side in our struggle to define the terms of our interdependence: the open hand against the clenched fist, inclusive politics and economics versus division and dominance, cooperation against control, life against death.\"\n\nDutch media is now saying that only 40-50 bodies of victims in total will be returned to the Netherlands today. There were 298 people on board, including 198 Dutch passengers .\n\nEarlier today we thought around 60 Dutch bodies would be returned home this afternoon.\n\n09.22 As reported in this morning's Telegraph, Russian oligarchs have begun shifting assets out of London as sanctions loom over MH17. Peter Dominiczak and Matthew Holehouse report:\n\nRussian oligarchs are moving money out of London following threats of tough financial sanctions in the wake of the attack on Flight MH17, Downing Street has said.\n\nAllies of Vladimir Putin are understood to be reacting after British demands to punish the Russian president’s “cronies”.\n\nThe European Union on Tuesday agreed to draw up a list of Russians who will face sanctions following the downing of the Malaysia Airlines plane, which killed 298 people.\n\nNo 10 refused to say which oligarchs were being targeted because of the risk of “asset flight”.\n\nFull report: Russian oligarchs shift assets out of London as sanctions loom\n\n09.10 Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf carries a striking image of the wreckage on its front page, with the headline: \"This is the proof\".\n\nThe article says that the plane was shot down by a Russian-made missile.\n\nDe Volkskrant's front page shows the Australian Boeing C-17 in Eindhoven, preparing to fly to Kharkiv to bring the bodies back. The headline simply reads: \"National day of mourning\"\n\n08.55 Ben Farmer has arrived at Kharkiv airport, where the British ambassador to the Ukraine is present to see off the victims' bodies on their flight to the Netherlands:\n\nBritish embassy officials, including the ambassador, Simon Smith, are at the airport.\n\nHe said he had \"enormous respect for the families and their understanding that this is an extremely difficult operation that requires an awful lot of different nations coming together\".\n\nHe said no British relatives had made the journey to Kharkiv to meet the bodies.\n\nA British forensic expert is expected to accompany the first flight, a C130 Hercules, when it flies to Eindhoven.\n\nBritish officials will also be in the Dutch City to meet it.\n\n\n\nPeople load coffins carrying some of remains of Malaysia Airlines MH17 victims to a transport plane at Kharkiv airport (GLEB GARANICH/REUTERS)\n\n08.25 While events progress on the ground in Ukraine, the EU prepares to continue discussions over sanctions against Russia today. This follows yesterday's agreement of \"concrete proposals\" to draw up a list of individuals close to Vladimir Putin to be targeted.\n\nEU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels agreed \"concrete proposals\" to draw up a list of the Russian president's associates who would be subject to punitive measures, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said.\n\nThe first names will be considered at a meeting tomorrow, where ministers will also look at broader sanctions such as arms embargoes and access to capital and hi-tech goods.\n\nMr Cameron has openly criticised a \"reluctance\" on the part of some European nations to take stronger action against Moscow, saying it would be \"unthinkable\" in the UK to go ahead with a French deal to sell helicopter carriers to Russia.\n\nBut MPs have warned that Britain is itself continuing to export tens of millions of pounds worth of arms and other dual-use military equipment to Russia.\n\nThe Commons Committees on Arms Export Controls said that 251 export licences for the sale to Russia of controlled goods worth at least £132 million remained in force.\n\nDespite a promise in March by the then foreign secretary William Hague to stop military sales to Russia which could be used against Ukraine, it said that just 31 licences had been revoked or suspended while Russia had been removed as a permitted destination on three others.\n\n08.10 Ben Farmer reports that the first bodies have now arrived at Kharkiv airport, where an honour guard is forming up to greet them:\n\nA refrigerated truck, believed to be full off bodies, left the Malyshev factory in Kharkiv at around 9.30am [7.30am UK time].\n\nThe truck made the short journey to the nearby airport under police escort and accompanied by Dutch investigators.\n\nAn honour guard of Ukrainian military personnel in blue uniforms with gold braid is forming up in one of the airport's hangars.\n\n07.52 Harriet Alexander is in the Netherlands this morning, where the victims's bodies are due to arrive this afternoon at Eindhoven:\n\nToday has been declared a national day of mourning in the Netherlands - the first since 1962, when Queen Wilhelmina died.\n\nAt 4pm local time we are expecting the first plane carrying bodies of the crash victims to arrive at Eindhoven - where King Willem-Alexander, Queen Maxima and Prime Minister Mark Rutte will be waiting.\n\nWe're told the bells will be rung across the country as the plane touches down.\n\nThe bodies will then be taken with a police escort to Hilversum, 100km away, where the identification process will be carried out.\n\nWe're hearing that 66 of the 198 Dutch victims have been identified and will be landing today.\n\n07.37 The Telegraph's defence correspondent Ben Farmer is in Kharkiv, where the first truck of bodies has left the tank plant at which they were stored overnight, and is now being driven with a police escort through the city, presumably to the airport:\n\nTwitter: Ben Farmer - Large refrigerated trucks arriving at Kharkiv's Malyshev factory where bodies stayed last night. #MH17 http://t.co/pm2l6ICPMd\n\n07.15 Overnight, US intelligence found that there was no direct link to Kremlin in plane downing although senior US intelligence officials maintained that Russia was responsible for \"creating the conditions\" that led to the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.\n\nThe intelligence officials were cautious in their assessment, noting that while the Russians have been arming separatists in eastern Ukraine, the U.S. had no direct evidence that the missile used to shoot down the passenger jet came from Russia.\n\nThe officials briefed reporters on Tuesday under ground rules that their names not be used in discussing intelligence related to last week's air disaster, which killed 298 people.\n\nThe plane was likely shot down by an SA-11 surface-to-air missile fired by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, the intelligence officials said, citing intercepts, satellite photos and social media postings by separatists, some of which have been authenticated by U.S. experts.\n\nBut the officials said they did not know who fired the missile or whether any Russian operatives were present at the missile launch. They were not certain that the missile crew was trained in Russia, although they described a stepped-up campaign in recent weeks by Russia to arm and train the rebels, which they say has continued even after the downing of the commercial jetliner.\n\nIn terms of who fired the missile, \"we don't know a name, we don't know a rank and we're not even 100 percent sure of a nationality,\" one official said, adding at another point, \"There is not going to be a Perry Mason moment here,\" a referenc to a fictional detective who solved mysteries.\n\n\n\nThe train carrying the 280 bodies recovered from MH17 arrives in Kharkiv on July 22, 2014(AFP/GETTY)\n\n07.00 Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the ongoing MH17 disaster. Today, the bodies of 282 of the victims are finally arriving in the Netherlands to undergo detailed identification and forensic examination.",

Last week, a contact group with representatives of Ukraine, Russia, Europe and the separatists met twice in Donetsk in an attempt to find common ground.

            "text": "The first 40 bodies from the 298 passengers killed who were on board the 17 July flight arrived in the Netherlands yesterday for identification and more bodies are expected to arrive today. The Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has this morning warned it could take \"weeks or even months\" before remains of the 43 Malaysians on board are repatriated.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ukraine’s defence ministry said two of their fighter jets had been shot down close to the crash site in eastern Ukraine by pro-Russian rebels, apparently by missiles.\n\nWestern leaders have accused Russia of arming the rebels throughout the crisis in Ukraine. The unnamed officer said: \"We have noted an increase in the amount of weapons being transferred from Russia to Ukraine in the last several weeks.\n\n“We continue to see evidence of the movement of weapons into Ukraine from Russia since the downing of (Malaysia Airlines flight) MH17, which is a cause for concern.”\n\nThe European Union has said Russia must stop the flow of weapons across the border or face tougher sanctions.\n\nThe news comes as investigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch in Hampshire tasked with analysing the plane’s black boxes confirmed they had successfully downloaded “valid data” from the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) which will be \"further analysed\".\n\nThe Dutch Safety Board (DSB), which is leading the investigation, said the CVR was damaged but the memory module intact, while \"no evidence or indications of manipulation\" was found after it was handed over by rebels earlier this week. The CVR records conversations and ambient sounds in the cockpit of a flight.\n\nAn examination of the flight data recorder (FDR) will begin today.\n\nThe DSB said: \"This will show whether this recorder also contains relevant information, in which case the data from both recorders will be combined.\"\n\nLast night, Alexander Borodai, the self-styled prime minister of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR), told the BBC his forces did not have the missile intelligence sources believe shot down the plane, insisting that any evidence showing otherwise is a “fake”.\n\n\"No, we didn't get a Buk. There were no BUKs in the area\" he insisted.\n\nAny photographs purporting to show a SA-11 BUK missile launcher, the type some believe brought down the passenger jet, were “photoshopped”, he added.\n\nBorodai also claimed the US President Barack Obama was \"feeding off the Ukrainian propaganda machine\" and blamed the OSCE monitors for the bodies being left in fields for three days, who he said told him: “I represent 57 countries. Don’t you dare touch the bodies of the dead.\"\n\nOn the same night, separatist commander Alexander Khodakovsky appeared to contradict Borodai, telling Reuters the rebels could have received a BUK missile system from Russia.\n\nAlexander Borodai He said: \"That Buk I know about. I heard about it. I think they sent it back. Because I found out about it at exactly the moment that I found out that this tragedy had taken place. They probably sent it back in order to remove proof of its presence.”\n\nHowever, he later appeared to retract his comments, telling Russian news agency Life News that he had simply been discussing \"possible versions\" with Reuters. He insisted rebels \"do not have and have never had\" a BUK.",

            "text": "A humanitarian convoy accompanied by Russian military personnel and military vehicles advanced toward the Ukrainian border with the intention of crossing into the country late on Aug. 8, but it stopped short of the frontier, a senior Ukrainian official has said.\n\nSpeaking to a live audience on the \"Shuster Live\" TV news program, Deputy Chief of the Presidential Administration Valeriy Chaly said the transit of the convoy could have provoked a full-scale war between the two countries. He did not say where the convoy had planned to enter the Ukrainian territory.\n\n“Russia tried to make a serious provocation just a few hours ago tonight. This provocation could have resulted in an unpredictable development of events and escalation of threats,” Chaly said. \"Through diplomatic work in the first place, the president of Ukraine stopped the provocation.\"\n\nFor its part, Russia dismissed the statement by Chaly as a farce.\n\n\"Each time Kyiv is more and more inventive in creating fairy tales,\" said Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry.\n\n\"The (Ukrainian) National Guard probably have to report about their achievements in the field, so they pretended they have some,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Chaly, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko held an emergency meeting with security officials and communicated with world leaders about the incident.\n\nHe said Poroshenko had a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer. On behalf of the President, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Pavlo Klimkin held talks with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, from whom he received assurances that the convoy \"will stop,\" said Chaly.\n\nUkraine's Foreign Ministry also warned that the convoy would have further inflamed tensions that already seem to be at fever pitch.\n\n\"Against the backdrop of repeated violations by the Russian side of the state border of Ukraine and arms, equipment and mercenaries in the Ukrainian side there are reasonable grounds to believe that the said convoy can be used to further escalate the tension and lead to further complication of the situation of residents of Donbass,\" read the ministry's statement.\n\nThe Russian action was presented to be in cooperation with the Red Cross, Chaly said. However, he and the Ukrainian news site Ukrainska Pravda reported that the Red Cross denied any involvement with the humanitarian convoy.\n\nOn Aug. 6, First Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine Hennadiy Zubko stated that the deployment of any peacekeepers by Russia to Ukraine will be considered as an act of direct aggression.\n\n“The peacekeeping contingent, which has been located near Ukraine-Russia border for more than 5 months, can hardly be called peacekeeping. Therefore, its deployment would be considered direct aggression. I believe that today the international community is not going to approve of the deployment of Russian peacekeeping forces in Ukraine,” Zubko said.\n\nThe United States has also sounded the alarm.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power delivered a stern warning at a Security Council meeting in New York on Aug. 7, after reports showed Moscow has beefed up its military presence on the border, dispatching what NATO estimates is 20,000 troops to the frontier.\n\n\"Any further unilateral intervention by Russia into Ukrainian territory, including one under the guise of providing humanitarian aid, would be completely unacceptable and deeply alarming — and it would be viewed as an invasion of Ukraine,\" Power said.\n\nEditor’s Note: This article has been produced for Kyivpost with support from www.mymedia.org.ua, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and implemented by a joint venture between NIRAS and BBC Media Action, as well as Ukraine Media Project, managed by Internews and funded by the United States Agency for International Development.",

            "text": "Ukraine and the International Committee of the Red Cross will lead a humanitarian convoy supported by the European Union, the United States and Russia to the country's conflict-torn eastern city of Luhansk, according to Ukraine's Foreign Ministry.\n\n\"Due to the complex humanitarian and social situation in the Donbas, Ukraine President Poroshenko took the initiative to send to Luhansk Oblast international humanitarian aid missions,\" the ministry said in an official statement on Aug. 11. \"In addition to goods, prepared by the Ukrainian side, the mission will also include an international component and, in particular, humanitarian assistance provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United States, the EU and Russia.\"\n\n\"Logistical support of the international humanitarian relief mission, including its delivery and distribution, will be provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross and Ukraine,\" the Ministry added.\n\nLaurent Corbaz, the ICRC's head of operations for Europe and Central Asia, said in a statement it is \"urgent that aid reaches people in Luhansk and in other areas in the eastern part of the country, which have sustained heavy fighting over the past weeks.\"\n\nThe ICRC said it met with the Ukrainian and the Russian authorities and shared a document which specifies the manner in which such an operation can be carried out.\n\nA senior official in Ukraine's presidential administration told the Kyiv Post that \"Russia will have a formal part in the convoy, but there will be no Russian [military] forces, no soldiers.\"\n\nMoreover, the ICRC added that it \"does not accept armed escorts\" as part of the relief mission.\n\nUkraine had previously objected to Russian involvement in relief efforts, fearing that a humanitarian mission could be used as a cover for an invasion of Russian soldiers.\n\nEarlier on Aug. 11, Russia said it would send a \"humanitarian convoy\" into Ukraine as part of a coordinated mission with the International Red Cross, according to a Kremlin statement.\n\nHowever the ICRC in Kyiv denied cooperating with Russian on plans for a humanitarian convoy to eastern Ukraine, according to the RBC news agency, citing ICRC representative Ashot Astabatsyan.\n\nLater, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that the details of the humanitarian operations would take place under the auspices of the Red Cross in cooperation with Kyiv.\n\n\"We have agreed on all the details with the leadership of Ukraine,\" he was quoted as saying by Itar-Tass.\n\nStill, a presidential administration official said that with Russia participating in the convoy the risk of war between the countries \"goes up.\"\n\nThere have been recent threats of Russian incursions into the country. On Friday, a so-called humanitarian convoy accompanied by Russian military personnel and military vehicles advanced toward the Ukrainian border with the intention of crossing into the country late on Aug. 8, but it stopped short of the frontier, said Deputy Chief of the Presidential Administration Valeriy Chaly.\n\nThe presidential administration official who spoke with the Kyiv Post on Aug. 11 said the move was \"nearly a real disaster, nearly an invasion.\"\n\n\"It was pure Russian aggression, Russian will,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking on a Ukrainian TV news program, Chaly said the transit of the convoy could have provoked a full-scale war between the countries. He added that Russia is welcome to participate in the humanitarian mission to Luhansk only if it followed international agreements and adhered to Ukrainian legislation under the auspices of the Red Cross.\n\nSpeaking on ICTV's \"Freedom of Speech\" program late on Aug. 11, Chaly complained that Russian-backed separatists twice refused to engage in talks in order to coordinate the arrival of humanitarian assistance in areas they control, including the city of Luhansk and that region's capital.\n\nIn past weeks Russia has built up its military presence on its border with Ukraine, massing some 12,000 troops, according to NATO, and carried out war games with fighter jets and combat helicopters.\n\nLuhansk, a city about 20 miles form the Russian border with a pre-war population of some 450,000 people that has been reduced to about 250,000 since the onslaught of Ukraine's military operation in mid-April, has been among the hardest hit cities in the eastern region. It has been plagued by heavy fighting in recent weeks and bombarded by shells. As a result, the city has been without electricity and water for more than a week.\n\nEditor’s Note: This article has been produced for Kyivpost with support from www.mymedia.org.ua, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and implemented by a joint venture between NIRAS and BBC Media Action, as well as Ukraine Media Project, managed by Internews and funded by the United States Agency for International Development.",

            "text": "SEMIONOVKA, Donetsk Oblast -- The May 22 murders of 18 Ukrainian soldiers near Olhinka in Donetsk Oblast served as tragic reminders to the world that Ukraine is locked in a bloody war with Kremlin-backed separatists. ,\n\nBut Ukrainian army soldiers trying to stay alive at a checkpoint near the village of Semionovka between Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, two cities controlled by Kremlin-backed separatists, don't need any reminders.\n\nThey know the dangers all too well. And so do their bosses.\n\n“Our commander, when checking the checkpoints, never comes here as it is too dangerous,” said army soldier Maxim with a bitter smile, not giving his name because of fears for his safety if identified publicly.\n\nMaxim, a tank man, showed the Kyiv Post a big hole in the ground caused when a shell exploded only 50 meters from his tank. In yet more bitter irony, the gun that fired the shell was a Ukrainian one. It belonged to a group of soldiers from the Dnipropetrovsk airborne brigade, who defected from the Ukrainian army and are now fighting on the side of Sloviansk separatists against their former comrades.\n\nMaxim said that the traitors initially called their former colleagues trying to entice them to defect with stories of getting good salaries for siding with the Kremlin-backed insurgents, officially considered to as terrorists by the Ukrainian government and many other Ukrainians.\n\nWearing shorts he made from military pants and a khaki bandana, sporting a tattoo in the shape of a paratrooper on his shoulder, Maxim said he is not sure why he stands there day and night, suffering from heat and dodging shells.\n\nAndriy, a tall guy with a small pistol in his hand, stops and closely checks cars coming from Sloviansk. He said the defectors are getting some Hr 4,000 per day, while the Ukrainian soldiers were receiving less than this amount per month.\n\nStill Andriy stays “for the sake of Ukraine,” emphatically making his patriotic point: “This is my country and I’m serving it.\"\n\nAndriy is a former Berkut police officer part of a unit disbanded for brutality against protesters during the EuroMaidan Revolution that overthrew President Viktor Yanukovych on Feb. 22. Andriy speaks perfect Ukrainian as he comes from Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine. He said he wasn’t injured during the EuroMaidan Revolution, but he hated the National Guard unit that was partly formed from former Maidan protesters. “They were throwing Molotov cocktails at me,” he said.\n\nAndriy believes he is serving his country here near Sloviansk just the way he did it in Kyiv several months ago. Every day he calls on a priest to get some advice about his life.\n\nDima, in the blue beret of a paratrooper, emerges with a wide smile from the forest where the soldiers have their little camp. “Do you know what’s going on in my Odesa now?” he asked. He is said it’s hard to get fresh news about his native city.\n\nDima said he was fighting not for Ukraine but rather for the local people who keep bringing water and food for the soldiers, opening themselves to to the risk of being persecuted by the separatists if caught. “Without these people we would die here,” he said.\n\nThere is a line of jars with homemade pickles along the road where the tanks are parked as well as the cheapest “kilka in tomato sauce,” or canned fish. The soldiers said they also received some NATO dry rations sent them by the army. “But the military outfit that our commanders also received from NATO was sold on the market in Dnipropetrovsk,” Dima said.\n\nThe conversation was stopped by an officer, who came and pointed out that it was getting darker and shootouts mostly start in the night.\n\n“Ladies, you better go now,” he told the Kyiv Post, smiling.\n\n“And you guys, get to your cars,” he yelled, addressing his soldiers.\n\nEditor’s Note: This article has been produced with support from www.mymedia.org.ua, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and implemented by a joint venture between NIRAS and BBC Media Action, as well as Ukraine Media Project, managed by Internews and funded by the United States Agency for International Development.

There is no way you're going across,” he explained to them. \n\n \n\n He and his fellow guards reclaimed the border post just after 11 a.m. on July 1, he said, explaining that the gunfight that ensued when they rolled up in armored vehicles was “intense.” The large casings scattered around, the blown-out windows of surrounding buildings and the bullet-riddled guardrails along the highway appeared to prove his account.\n\n \n\n Despite the ferocity of the clash, no Ukrainian government fighters suffered injuries, nor were any killed, the border guard said, adding that he couldn’t speak for the rebels. However, days earlier one of their armored vehicles drove over a landmine that exploded beneath it, wounding “several” servicemen, he said.\n\n \n\n Two hundred Ukrainian servicemen and law enforcement personnel have been killed and 619 wounded in eastern Ukraine since the anti-terrorist operation began in April, the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council said on July 2.\n\nUkrainian servicemen and armored vehicles guard the Dovzhanskiy border crossing. About 21 kilometers down the highway is a rebel checkpoint, and beyond that rebel territory. \n\n \n\n Following the border guards’ seizure of the border crossing, a minesweeper found some 35 landmines planted by the rebels, according to the border guard who spoke with the Kyiv Post. He swiped through photographs taken with his smartphone of the landmines, as well as other improvised explosives abandoned by the rebels during the gunfight.\n\n \n\n The rebels also left crates of Molotov cocktails when they fled, the border guard said, pointing to one such crate.\n\nMeanwhile, only 21 kilometers west on the same highway, nervous rebels milled about at the Dyakovskiy intersection block post, inspecting passing cars and reinforcing their post with large cement slabs\n\nA woman named Natasha, who declined to give her last name, showed the Kyiv Post a pile of twisted rocket remains she claimed were Grad missiles fired at them by Ukrainian forces on June 30. She said no one was injured when the missiles struck the earth surrounding their position.\n\n \n\n Ukrainian forces have been seen transporting heavy artillery, including Grad rocket systems, to the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. But the rebels, too, have been seen transporting the rocket systems, which are known for being deadly and inaccurate. \n\n \n\n As Natasha was speaking, several muffled explosions were heard from somewhere nearby, which she said were more Grad missiles.\n\n \n\n “Hear that? Those are Grads,” she said. The sound was punctuated by sporadic bursts of gunfire that echoed through the rolling steppe.\n\nEditor’s Note: This article has been produced for Kyivpost with support from www.mymedia.org.ua, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and implemented by a joint venture between NIRAS and BBC Media Action.

Here’s some angles on what may be happening and the risks involved.\n\nUkraine Army Advancing Against Rebels\n\nThe Kyiv Post (a Ukrainian news outlet) reported yesterday that Ukraine army units were advancing against the rebels and recovering previously lost territory after heavy fighting in the Donetsk region. Donetsk is the major metropolitan area in East Ukraine with a total population of about 2 million; the city itself is about 980,000. Rebel forces are reported to be retreating.\n\nWhile most eyes of the world were focused on the July 17 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 that killed 298 people, Ukraine’s government forces continued assaults that regained territory from Russian-backed separatist fighters. Using everything from small arms and mortars to heavy artillery and airstrikes, they have managed to retake some key cities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts [an oblast is a Russian term for an administrative district ~sig94], home to 15 percent of Ukraine’s population, forcing the insurgents to retreat to provincial capitals and their outskirts. The military is closer than ever to fully encircling the rebels. But the wins have come at a steep cost. Hundreds of civilians have been killed since the government launched its anti-terrorist operation in mid-April. [...]Despite the significant gains, Ukraine’s military have not been able to close the Russian border completely, and alleges that its positions are shelled by artillery from Russian territory. NATO continues to see evidence of weapons being moved into Ukraine from Russia since the downing of a Malaysian airliner in eastern Ukraine last week, a NATO military officer said on July 23. So long as a corridor remains open for reinforcements and munitions, the rebels will likely continue to fight. “We have noted an increase in the amount of weapons being transferred from Russia to Ukraine in the last several weeks. We continue to see evidence of the movement of weapons into Ukraine from Russia since the downing of (Malaysia Airlines flight) MH17, which is a cause for concern,” said the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nAnd what do the Russians have to say?\n\n\n\n Putin’s Gamble?\n\nThis Forbes Magazine (not yet the property of the Chinese) opinion piece has a different take on the political acumen of Vlad Putin and the reasons why he apparently is blowing his wad on the Ukraine.\n\nWhy would the leader of a powerful country in reasonably good standing want to risk everything by putting himself in the same league with Muammar Gaddafi? Many say that it is all part of Putin’s master plan, that he has been scheming for years to create a greater Russia and that he has been skillfully moving his chess pieces around the board in order to attain that objective. Yet most Kremlin experts say otherwise. They insist that he is a talented tactician with little taste for broad strategic thinking. [...]Since the crisis began, he has been taking on ever greater risk—not to mention serious damage to the Russian economy—with negative return. Before the crisis began, Ukraine was slowly moving towards Europe, now it is actively running away from Russia. European public opinion, even before MH-17, has turned decidedly against Putin. Russia’s most talented citizens are leaving in droves. So it appears that Putin is not only a poor chess player, he is an exceeding bad poker player, constantly raising the stakes while facing a decreasing expected return. If he ever could return Ukraine to the fold—an exceedingly unlikely prospect—he would accomplish no more than a return to the status quo ante. [...]After the election of Petro Poroshenko to Ukraine’s Presidency came more setbacks. The rebel strongholds of Slaviansk and Kramatorsk were retaken by Ukrainian anti-terrorist troops and they began moving toward Donetsk and Luhansk. So Putin escalated again, sending heavy artillery and more sophisticated weapons, including the one that shot down MH-17. Miscalculation. Failure. Escalation. The downing of MH-17 is a logical consequence of the pattern. Putin took the actions that lead to the downing of MH-17 because he believes that he has no other choice. He’s stuck, for lack of a better term and it’s not at all clear that he sees a way out. He must either continue to escalate or betray his own ambitions.\n\nAfter spending two weeks vacation in Croatia, my Army daughter is home for a visit. I asked for her opinion on the events in the Ukraine. Her response, “If they pull us out of Afghanistan completely I don’t think we’ll be out of a job very long.”  Yeah, she’s a cynic.",

opposite the cabinet of ministers on lenin square has been obstructed daily by members of socalled crimean selfdefense militias since march these men dressed in camouflage and armed with police batons and sometimes guns wander into the building freely where their frequent destination is the office of the center for investigative journalism weve all come across them says journalist tatiana kurmanova wearily they make no concrete demands they just have the effect of scaring us – imagine the first time when they came in here with pistols looking at everything the center financed through grants from the us agency for international development and other foreign donors was one of the first media organizations to receive such unwanted attention in russiacontrolled crimea if russian president vladimir putin remains in control of ukraines peninsula and follows the same policy for crimea that he does with the rest of the russian federation then foreignfunded projects in particular those with usaid funding will be targets for shutdown the crimean selfdefense members marched into the journalism centers office on march 1 two days after soldiers without insignia appeared throughout the peninsula and set in motion the russian invasion and occupation or – as russian law would have it annexation of crimea the selfdefense militias ungoverned by any law have since become a permanent fixture of daily life in crimea patrolling streets guarding transport hubs and government buildings demanding to see the documents of passersby – and harassing journalists while attacks on media have abated somewhat since march when the center for investigative journalism recorded 85 incidents crimea has by no means become a safe place for journalists oleg sentsov was arrested earlier this month in crimea where the human rights situation is rapidly deteriorating and now hes been charged by russia with planning a terrorist attackrussias federal security service has accused sentsov of being a member of ukrainian rightwing group pravey sector adding that he was in possession of explosives firearms and nationalist paraphernalia the german film group funding sentsovs project says the filmmakers only crime was that he opposed russias annexation of crimea in the last six weeks andrey krisko who heads the crimean human rights field mission has registered nine serious incidents of harassment of journalists involving personal harm damage to equipment and illegal detention for more than three hours he experienced one such incident himself when he was physically prevented from taking pictures of a journalist arguing with selfdefense forces on may 17 later he found out the journalist had been followed and detained most cases krisko said concern not single but groups of journalists and all cases involve the selfdefense militias some cases have been widely publicized like that of journalist osman pashayev on may 18 pashayev was filming the crimean tatar meeting commemorating 70 years of their deportation and the hundreds of riot police guarding simferopol city center when selfdefense forces detained both him and his turkish cameraman they were held for 10 hours had all their equipment taken away and were denied access to lawyers until a threatened appeal to the prosecutors office kurmanova thinks there are probably many more such incidents involving the selfdefense and russian federal security service or fsb under its russian acronym but journalists working for crimean government media do not want to publicize them most of the journalists who have spoken publicly like pashayev left crimea afterwards as soon as they could meanwhile several crimean civil activists who supported the euromaidan revolution that ousted president viktor yanukovych on feb 22 and protested against russian occupation are currently detained by the fsb the fsb said on may 30 that film director oleg sentsov alexandr kolchenko oleksiy chyrniy and hennadiy afanasyev are under arrest charged with being members of ukraines ultranationalistic right sector and suspected of plotting to stage acts of sabotage and terrorist attacks in several cities of the peninsula kateryna serhatskova a journalist and coordinator of an initiative group to help sentsov says sentsov kolchenko chyrniy and afanasyev have never been members of right sector for those who have doubts these guys have never been members of the right sector and prepared no terrorist attacks these are absolutely peaceful people who maintained the integrity of ukraine now confessions are being forced out of them and probably one of them will admit his guilt all in all its outrageous nonsense no comment serhatskova wrote on her facebook page on may 30 according to interfaxukraine news service the whereabouts of two more activists timur shaimardanov and leonid korzh reported missing by the ukrainian organisation ukrainian house on may 28 are unknown the effect of this intimidation has been to effectively silence critical or opposition media to the russian annexation within crimea tv channel atr and the website 15 minutes both owned by crimean tatar businessman lenur islyamov have greatly cut down on their live programming and news coverage since march the only other independent agencies left the center for investigative journalism and the radio libertysupported project crimean reality both have regular problems with the selfdefense militias this situation when there are these groups that dont answer to anyone that arent controlled by any law means its impossible to say journalists can work professionally here says krisko the risk of damage to equipment or personal attacks as well as fear of censorship means that those who want to give objective information simply cant in methods reminiscent of soviet tactics smear campaigns censorship and simple exclusion by news sources are also silencing journalists who might want to show a less onesided prorussian view of current affairs in crimea kurmanova and her colleagues regularly receive online threats and hate mail since the beginning of march meanwhile two journalists from the yevpatoria councilfunded newspaper yevpatoria health resort who had been less than enthusiastic about russian occupation became subject to an attempted witch hunt in may when rival journalists sent a letter accusing them of being spies and provocateurs to the city council we dont demand the exile of these people from their town and their profession according to the letter but we yevpatorians do not need these masked fifth columnists in our hometown and paid from the town budget it concludes by saying that if the town council does not remove them from the paper we will appeal to the fsb demanding they protect us russian citizens from journalists openly conducting subversive activities the two journalists have so far held on to their jobs and did not want to comment further on the incident since the end of february when a new crimean parliament was announced journalists from the center for investigative journalism have not been able to get parliamentary accreditation lawmakers refuse to speak to them or call them american spies the crimean cabinet of ministers press service does not answer their calls they are not informed of meetings and press conferences or are denied entry theres a very clear difference between journalists from russian media who can get into the offices of officials and anywhere else with no problem and journalists from ukrainian media who might ask awkward questions says kurmanova were like white crows no one wants to talk to us before it was all organised we could write a request for information or set up filming now we get our information in bits and pieces grabbing officials outside buildings if they agree to speak shevket ganiyev editorinchief of crimean tatar programming at the crimean state broadcasting company trk was excluded from news coverage through a different method he and his director were simply sent home for a months holiday ganiyevs small amount of allotted live broadcasting had already been taken off air with no warning in march before a hastilyorganised referendum on joining crimea to russia ganiyev and his colleagues who like most crimean tatars openly opposed the referendum then agreed with trk management which openly supported it that his department would boycott working at trk until after the referendum when his team came back on air they were subject to much closer control on april 24 they were told they could not make any mention at all of crimean tatar governing body the mejlis or of crimean tatar leaders mustafa jemilev and refat chubarov in their programming this has meant the editorial has had to ignore events widely covered in the international media – including russian if theres news in russian media and we are not allowed to talk about it how can any journalist accept this as normal asks ganiyev were not just banned from talking about the mejlis as good or bad we are not even allowed to cover facts the same day as the ban ganiyev and the editorial director were asked by trk management to take a months leave of course they didnt say so but i think they had to send us on holiday because then our collective would be easier to control says ganiyev may was a worrying time for them because of the 70th anniversary of the crimean tatar deportation and events connected with that i think they were scared and tried to protect themselves ganiyev was back at work from may 28 but he and his team have no idea what the future will bring amid the general upheaval at trk which was formerly funded by the ukrainian government but is now is a state of stasis for the crimean tatar editorial this is yet another setback in their fight for more airtime in their own language their live airtime was reduced over a year ago to 13 minutes news a day and their recorded programming is exclusively about cultural and social matters were hostages in this situation says ganiyev for us the most important things are to preserve our work places and editorial so that we can broadcast in crimean tatar language if tomorrow they kick us out and bring in new journalists who are convenient for them and who speak in incorrect crimean tatar theyll be pleased because it will start the assimilation of our language under the ukrainian license still being used at trk crimean tatar language is allotted seven percent of overall airtime ukrainian language programming before march was even more limited since march one of just three weekly ukrainian language programmes has switched to russian svetlana datsenko editor of one of the two remaining ukrainian programmes said she had also been asked to switch to russian if there are three equal state languages in crimea then there should be proportional coverage 33 percent for each language ganiyev points out but neither he nor datsenko have much expectation of that happening the new head of trk boris nemets is from crimean government head sergei aksyonovs russian unity party as is the new crimean minister for information the partys key campaigning platform is russian language rights as crimea moves rapidly towards adopting russian legislation the situation for a free media is only set to get worse on top of harassment and exclusion staff of the center for investigative journalism have a whole array of logistical problems to deal with their salaries paid from foreign donors are frozen as the crimean banking system has collapsed they have been

problems since annexation and downplaying or disregarding nonrussian ethnic groups it is little surprise that kurmanova and datsenko from trk both plan to leave crimea for mainland ukraine by the end of the summer we had strict editorial standards and i suppose thats why its hardest of all for us because now no one here needs such editorial standards says kurmanova its easier just not to ask

            "text": "SIMFEROPOL, Crimea -- The entrance to the Simferopol Trade Union building, which stands opposite the Cabinet of Ministers on Lenin Square, has been obstructed daily by members of so-called Crimean self-defense militias since March.\n\nThese men, dressed in camouflage and armed with police batons and sometimes guns, wander into the building freely, where their frequent destination is the office of the Center for Investigative Journalism. “We’ve all come across them,” says journalist Tatiana Kurmanova wearily. “They make no concrete demands. They just have the effect of scaring us – imagine the first time when they came in here with pistols, looking at everything.”\n\nThe center, financed through grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development and other foreign donors, was one of the first media organizations to receive such unwanted attention in Russia-controlled Crimea. If Russian President Vladimir Putin remains in control of Ukraine's peninsula and follows the same policy for Crimea that he does with the rest of the Russian Federation, then foreign-funded projects -- in particular those with USAID funding - will be targets for shutdown.\n\nThe Crimean self-defense members marched into the journalism center's office on March 1, two days after soldiers without insignia appeared throughout the peninsula and set in motion the Russian invasion and occupation or – as Russian law would have it - annexation of Crimea. The self-defense militias, ungoverned by any law, have since become a permanent fixture of daily life in Crimea, patrolling streets, guarding transport hubs and government buildings, demanding to see the documents of passersby – and harassing journalists.\n\nWhile attacks on media have abated somewhat since March, when the Center for Investigative Journalism recorded 85 incidents, Crimea has by no means become a safe place for journalists.\n\nOleg Sentsov was arrested earlier this month in Crimea where the human rights situation is rapidly deteriorating, and now he's been charged by Russia with planning a terrorist attack.Russia's Federal Security Service has accused Sentsov of being a member of Ukrainian right-wing group, Pravey Sector, adding that he was in possession of explosives, firearms and nationalist paraphernalia. The German film group funding Sentsov's project says the filmmaker's only 'crime' was that he opposed Russia's annexation of Crimea.\n\nIn the last six weeks, Andrey Krisko, who heads the Crimean Human Rights Field Mission, has registered nine serious incidents of harassment of journalists, involving personal harm, damage to equipment and illegal detention for more than three hours. He experienced one such incident himself, when he was physically prevented from taking pictures of a journalist arguing with self-defense forces on May 17. Later, he found out the journalist had been followed and detained.\n\nMost cases, Krisko said, concern not single but groups of journalists, and all cases involve the self-defense militias. Some cases have been widely publicized, like that of journalist Osman Pashayev on May 18. Pashayev was filming the Crimean Tatar meeting commemorating 70 years of their deportation, and the hundreds of riot police guarding Simferopol city center, when self-defense forces detained both him and his Turkish cameraman. They were held for 10 hours, had all their equipment taken away, and were denied access to lawyers until a threatened appeal to the prosecutors office.\n\nKurmanova thinks there are probably many more such incidents involving the self-defense and Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB under its Russian acronym, but journalists working for Crimean government media do not want to publicize them. Most of the journalists who have spoken publicly, like Pashayev, left Crimea afterwards as soon as they could.\n\nMeanwhile several Crimean civil activists who supported the EuroMaidan Revolution that ousted President Viktor Yanukovych on Feb. 22 and protested against Russian occupation are currently detained by the FSB.\n\nThe FSB said on May 30 that film director Oleg Sentsov, Alexandr Kolchenko, Oleksiy Chyrniy and Hennadiy Afanasyev are under arrest charged with being members of Ukraine's ultra-nationalistic Right Sector and suspected of plotting to stage acts of sabotage and terrorist attacks in several cities of the peninsula.\n\nKateryna Serhatskova, a journalist and coordinator of an initiative group to help Sentsov, says Sentsov, Kolchenko, Chyrniy and Afanasyev have never been members of Right Sector.\n\n\"For those who have doubts: these guys have never been members of the Right Sector and prepared no terrorist attacks, these are absolutely peaceful people, who maintained the integrity of Ukraine. Now confessions are being forced out of them, and probably one of them will admit his guilt all in all. It's outrageous nonsense. No comment,\" Serhatskova wrote on her Facebook page on May 30, according to Interfax-Ukraine news service.\n\nThe whereabouts of two more activists, Timur Shaimardanov and Leonid Korzh, reported missing by the Ukrainian organisation Ukrainian House on May 28, are unknown.\n\nThe effect of this intimidation has been to effectively silence critical or opposition media to the Russian annexation within Crimea. TV channel ATR and the website 15 Minutes, both owned by Crimean Tatar businessman Lenur Islyamov, have greatly cut down on their live programming and news coverage since March.\n\nThe only other independent agencies left, the Center for Investigative Journalism and the Radio Liberty-supported project Crimean Reality, both have regular problems with the self-defense militias.\n\n“This situation when there are these groups that don’t answer to anyone, that aren’t controlled by any law, means it’s impossible to say journalists can work professionally here,” says Krisko. “The risk of damage to equipment or personal attacks, as well as fear of censorship, means that those who want to give objective information simply can’t.”\n\nIn methods reminiscent of Soviet tactics, smear campaigns, censorship and simple exclusion by news sources are also silencing journalists who might want to show a less one-sided, pro-Russian view of current affairs in Crimea. Kurmanova and her colleagues regularly receive online threats and hate mail since the beginning of March.\n\nMeanwhile two journalists from the Yevpatoria council-funded newspaper Yevpatoria Health Resort, who had been less than enthusiastic about Russian occupation, became subject to an attempted witch hunt in May when rival journalists sent a letter accusing them of being spies and provocateurs to the city council.\n\n\"We don’t demand the exile of these people from their town and their profession,\" according to the letter. \"But we Yevpatorians do not need these masked ‘fifth columnists’ in our hometown, and paid from the town budget!\"\n\nIt concludes by saying that if the town council does not remove them from the paper, \"we will appeal to the FSB demanding they protect us Russian citizens from journalists openly conducting subversive activities.\"\n\nThe two journalists have so far held on to their jobs, and did not want to comment further on the incident. Since the end of February, when a new Crimean parliament was announced, journalists from the Center for Investigative Journalism have not been able to get parliamentary accreditation. Lawmakers refuse to speak to them, or call them \"American spies.\" The Crimean Cabinet of Ministers’ press service does not answer their calls. They are not informed of meetings and press conferences, or are denied entry.\n\n“There’s a very clear difference between journalists from Russian media who can get into the offices of officials and anywhere else with no problem, and journalists from Ukrainian media who might ask awkward questions,” says Kurmanova. “We’re like white crows; no one wants to talk to us. Before it was all organised, we could write a request for information, or set up filming. Now we get our information in bits and pieces, grabbing officials outside buildings, if they agree to speak.”\n\nShevket Ganiyev, editor-in-chief of Crimean Tatar programming at the Crimean state broadcasting company TRK, was excluded from news coverage through a different method: He and his director were simply sent home for a month’s holiday.\n\nGaniyev’s small amount of allotted live broadcasting had already been taken off air with no warning in March, before a hastily-organised referendum on joining Crimea to Russia. Ganiyev and his colleagues, who like most Crimean Tatars openly opposed the referendum, then agreed with TRK management (which openly supported it) that his department would boycott working at TRK until after the referendum.  When his team came back on air, they were subject to much closer control.\n\nOn April 24, they were told they could not make any mention at all of Crimean Tatar governing body the Mejlis, or of Crimean Tatar leaders Mustafa Jemilev and Refat Chubarov in their programming. This has meant the editorial has had to ignore events widely covered in the international media – including Russian.\n\n“If there’s news in Russian media and we are not allowed to talk about it, how can any journalist accept this as normal?” asks Ganiyev. “We’re not just banned from talking about the Mejlis as good or bad. We are not even allowed to cover facts.”\n\nThe same day as the ban, Ganiyev and the editorial director were asked by TRK management to take a month’s leave.\n\n“Of course they didn’t say so, but I think they had to send us on holiday because then our collective would be easier to control,” says Ganiyev. “May was a worrying time for them because of the 70th anniversary of the [Crimean Tatar] deportation and events connected with that. I think they were scared and tried to protect themselves.”\n\nGaniyev was back at work from May 28, but he and his team have no idea what the future will bring amid the general upheaval at TRK, which was formerly funded by the Ukrainian government but is now is a state of stasis. For the Crimean Tatar editorial, this is yet another set-back in their fight for more airtime in their own language. Their live airtime was reduced over a year ago to 13 minutes news a day, and their recorded programming is exclusively about cultural and social matters.\n\nWe’re hostages in this situation,” says Ganiyev. “For us, the most important things are to preserve our work places and editorial so that we can broadcast in Crimean Tatar language. If tomorrow they kick us out and bring in new journalists who are convenient for them and who speak in incorrect Crimean Tatar they’ll be pleased, because it will start the assimilation of our language.”\n\nUnder the Ukrainian license still being used at TRK, Crimean Tatar language is allotted seven percent of overall airtime. Ukrainian language programming before March was even more limited. Since March, one of just three weekly Ukrainian language programmes has switched to Russian. Svetlana Datsenko, editor of one of the two remaining Ukrainian programmes, said she had also been asked to switch to Russian. “If there are three equal state languages in Crimea then there should be proportional coverage, 33 percent for each language,” Ganiyev points out. But neither he nor Datsenko have much expectation of that happening.\n\nThe new head of TRK, Boris Nemets, is from Crimean government head Sergei Aksyonov’s Russian Unity party, as is the new Crimean minister for information. The party’s key campaigning platform is Russian language rights.\n\nAs Crimea moves rapidly towards adopting Russian legislation, the situation for a free media is only set to get worse.\n\nOn top of harassment and exclusion, staff of the Center for Investigative Journalism have a whole array of logistical problems to deal with. Their salaries, paid from foreign donors, are frozen as the Crimean banking system has collapsed.\n\nThey have been told to vacate their rented offices by the end of July. Russian legislation, which comes into force in Crimea in January, requires that their organisation register as a foreign agent, and completely bans their main donor, USAID. Increasingly repressive Russian laws can shut down opposition websites, and impose prison sentences on anyone questioning Russian territorial integrity (which would include Crimea) in the media.\n\nMeanwhile a law legalizing the self-defense militias has already passed its first reading in the Crimean parliament. According to Kurmanova, it grants the militias a wide range of powers to stop, search, confiscate and detain, with minimum responsibilities. As state media in Crimea produces a soothing stream of information about a bright Russian future, ignoring the economic and social problems since annexation and downplaying or disregarding non-Russian ethnic groups, it is little surprise that Kurmanova and Datsenko from TRK both plan to leave Crimea for mainland Ukraine by the end of the summer.\n\n“We had strict editorial standards and I suppose that’s why it's hardest of all for us, because now no one here needs such editorial standards,’ says Kurmanova. “It’s easier just not to ask questions and to keep quiet.”\n\nEditor’s Note: This article has been produced with support from www.mymedia.org.ua, funded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and implemented by a joint venture between NIRAS and BBC Media Action, as well as Ukraine Media Project, managed by Internews and funded by the United States Agency for International Development.
