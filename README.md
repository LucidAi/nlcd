News Life Cycle Detector
========================

This repository contains natural language processing library for news cycle detection - `husky`, a simple command line pipeline and web application for demostrating the final output of the pipeline. This work is a prototype, it contains many bug, does not scale and requires a special knowlege to be used. Our research is in the early stage and we don't provide any useful readme at this point, but you can look at our demo (link is in the last section of this readme). Some screenshots:

### Description

The web media space is filled with the same piece of information cited and recited over and over again by different newspapers, blogs, etc. It is often difficult for journalists and readers to track statements to their origin and figure out, who published this piece of news first, when was it published, who cited whom, etc.

We propose a service that will detect a “life cycle” of a piece of news. It will allow news readers to track the piece of news back to it origins, see other citations of the original text together with the publishing source and the date of publishing.
