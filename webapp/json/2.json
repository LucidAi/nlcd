            "text": "DENVER: A US appeals court on Thursday ruled for the first time that states must allow gay couples to marry, finding the Constitution protects same-sex relationships and putting a remarkable legal winning streak across the country one step closer to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe three-judge panel in Denver found it \"wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of the love and commitment between same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples.\"\n\nThe decision upheld a lower court ruling that struck down Utah's gay marriage ban. However, the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals panel immediately put the ruling on hold so it could be appealed, either to the entire 10th Circuit or directly to the nation's highest court.\n\n\"All I can say is that we are thrilled,\" said Kody Partridge, one of the plaintiffs.\n\nThe decision gives increased momentum to a legal cause that already compiled an impressive winning streak in the lower courts after the Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates.\n\nThe latest of those rulings was in Indiana, where a federal judge on Wednesday struck down that state's same-sex marriage ban in a ruling that immediately allows gay couples to wed. The Indiana attorney general's office said it will appeal.\n\nThe appellate ruling on Utah comes 42 years after the Supreme Court refused to hear a case of two men who were refused a marriage license in Minnesota, finding there was no legal issue for the justices to consider, and just 10 years after 11 states voted to outlaw gay marriage.\n\nNow same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the Washington capital district in the United States.",

depression ferguson mo militarization of police preterm labor time lapse photography 28 comments good morning time lapse photography is something that fascinates me i think we can look at a picture of a time lapse image and see a metaphor for life movement continuous and repetitive there are a couple of types of time lapse photographythe short exposure kind which takes a normal exposure of sequential pictures over many hours or even days and edit them into one photograph ——————————– like the sunset images you see by artist matt molloy time lapse of moths in the porchlight – photographed by steve irvine for national geographic or the long exposure method where the camera shutter remains open for a long period of time and exposes the film to the image it is photographing —————————— these particular long exposed photos are blurred in appearance creating a glowing disoriented disturbed ghostlike or drugged feeling when you look at them it seems as if we are living in a time lapsed state of mind as you have been reading the boston boomers and daks coverage of late the mess in missouri is just the result of what has been building over time like the images you will see below throughout the postthe same scenarios have been played out all over the us the actual persons involved may be different but the general characteristics are the same when we see the reports of racial violence play out on the news we feel that repetition like the time lapsed images the scenes become blurred yet we know what happens at the end of the shot there is a good example of the differences in media treatment of violence here by the way when the media treats white suspects and killers better than black victims be sure to look at thatno need to belabor the point i will just let this oped by farai chideya from the guardian do that for me waiting in grand central station by james maher timelapse picture prints available on his website one note however it makes a uncomfortable point when rand paul gets a pat on the back from a black womanconsidering the neocon racist misogynistic shit he usually spewsbut youll get the point the author is making on race america has far to go ferguson wont be the last flash point i spent my very early years in new york living a very multiracial sesame street life a big swinging bellbottom of a childhood and then our family moved to baltimore and the iron curtain of the colour line fell i felt that i had moved from the 1970s through a time warp where black and white were the only two colours and never the twain shall socially meet i grew to understand what the 50s were actually like in baltimore when my mother for example was permitted to buy clothes from the major department store but not try them on heaven forfend some black lady should be in the dressing room right you know they leave a residue of blackness on the clothes america has never had one racial reality but a series of them strung together from san antonio to pittsburgh to appalachia what we are seeing in ferguson missouri is the result of life in a specific type of heavily racialised zone yes a city such as new york where a black man was recently choked to death by police officers has its own very clear forms of racialisation and its a national issue but the police killing last week of michael brown an unarmed black teen in ferguson has sparked national protests because it represents a specific type of racialisation this is of the majority black city big or small with a white economic and political power structure read the whole opinion piece this is the part about rand paul though it comes in comparison to obamas reactions to fergusons police departments militarization after the killing of another black youth trayvon martin tanehisi coates wrote a seminal piece for atlantic magazine called fear of a black president describing president obama as conservative in the very sphere where he holds singular gravity – race two years later with ferguson the president still holds tight to that caution about addressing racial inequality in terms of daytoday washington governance there is no fear of a black president congress fears him not certainly not the republicans and not even some members of his own party and now with a particularly tepid and circular statement on ferguson the president has gone even further he seems obsessed with convincing white americans he is not some goblin come to take their privilege away rather than recognising that pragmatically america still has enough deeply held racial biases that he will be perceived as a race man by some no matter what he does black americans learned his political strategy on race early in his first term as a group of leaders of african american organisations came to ask for more white house focus on jobs in black communities and were rebuffed they held their televised press conference outside the white house in a snowstorm a naturemade bathetic fallacy l ast week the president delivered a speech that seemed to weigh police intimidation and harassment of protesters and press with acts of vandalism almost equally put simply we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard particularly those of us in positions of authority he said lets remember that were all part of one american family in this diffuse speech the president could have spoken out more forcefully against the militarisation of local police forces as republican rand paul has done he could have tackled the unacceptable level and variety of unwarranted stops searches and frisking of black men in particular for bonus points he could have gotten into black incarceration rates or as author michelle alexander puts it the new jim crow you can read the rest at the link that is somethingwhen an asshole like rand gets kudos from a black woman who has the phrase new jim crow in the same paragraph but i think i get her pointyes i dont know dont get me wrong i agree with her but she could have pick a different politician to highlightam i right lets not forget that paul is the dude who didnt support the civil rights actno matter what shit he says now wash post recasts rand paul as civil rights ally forgetting their own reporting blog media matters for america anywayi need to move on in another oped this one from the sprinfield newsleader which is quoted as this editorial is the view of the newsleader editorial board linda rameygreiwe president and publisher paul berry executive director cheryl whitsitt managing editor our voice rights lost in ferguson riots it is very good and i feel it is too important not to quote the entire thing on aug 9 unarmed 18yearold michael brown was shot and killed by police officer darren wilson at 1201 pm in ferguson a vigil on aug 10 turned violent the situation deteriorated from there riots and arrests tear gas and rubber bullets real bullets riot gear and militarygrade displays of force injuries to both protesters and police looting and needless destruction of property for four straight nights the clashes escalated the national media descended and still no clear information was put forth about the death of a young unarmed black man after a day of relative calm gave hope that the situation was beginning to defuse tempers flared again friday as unrest continues the blame game is already underway at this point it would be easy to join in on the fingerpointing based on halftruths it would be easy join the chorus of voices calling out our elected leaders gov nixon us sens mccaskill and blunt and president obama for waiting so long to intervene it would be easy to place blame on the protesters for turning violent and rioting citing the need for peaceful assembly it would be easy to hoist the burden of responsibility onto local authorities in ferguson for their poor handling of the situation inciting protesters to riot rather than bringing calm it would be easy to join in blaming the media for stirring up the situation by giving attention to it it would be easy to as some are now doing blame the young man himself for allegedly participating in a theft prior to his altercation with the police but there is nothing easy about the situation in ferguson a solution for the community will take doing the hard work capt ron johnson of the missouri state highway patrol is doing the hard work rather than waging a battle johnson is working to open the lines of communication and erase the artificial boundaries between authorities and protesters state sen maria chappellenadal and st louis alderman antonio french are doing the hard work providing ontheground leadership standing up to rioters calling for peaceful protests and documenting events on twitter their work is reason to hope that the community will make it through this crisis there is no shortage of people being thrust forward to take the blame for what has happened in ferguson but at this moment as the nation watches a community teetering on the edge of chaos we must take the time to examine exactly what we are losing an unarmed young man was shot and killed by police his right to due process was violated which demands an explanation with an investigation underway it is our duty as citizens to care as much about the process and outcome of the investigations by the fbi and department of justice as we do the riots as the black community in ferguson protested it was met with aggression intimidation and eventual force from authorities some people rioted which can not be condoned in our society and should be dealt with but many assembled peacefully and were met with the same treatment peacefully assembled crowds had their rights violated as well we must seek answers as to why two reporters wesley lowery of the washington post and ryan reilly of the huffington post were taken into custody as they tried to follow police orders to leave a mcdonalds restaurant where they were working other journalists were specifically told to stop reporting what was happening again rights were violated this time in an attempt to silence the press that is promised to remain free blame is as easy to assign as it is to dodge at some point someone will take responsibility for what happened over the past several years this has come to mean little more than an acceptance that people will think poorly of the person for a few weeks or until the next big outrage comes along to distract us as americans and missourians thankful for the rights afforded to us by our constitution we must not lose interest in these events because the spectacle stops now is the time to wade through the rhetoric in order to hold our government and society accountable for what is happening in ferguson its the only way well manage to restore those rights good for the springfield newsleader damn glad there is a press out there near the heart of the situation that is keeping check on things the newsleader is a gannett newspaper as i was getting ready to shut down the laptop these headlines caught my attention its around 400 am btw ferguson on edge on first night with curfew huffington post clusters of protesters defy night

link from last week rekha basu iowa summit serves reminder of why religion politics dont mix opinion mcclatchy dc of everything coming out of this years iowa family leadership summit the fear factor is what stayed with me it was a constant discomfiting undercurrent like a loose nail poking up in your shoe it was organization president bob vander plaats declaring this a time of spiritual warfare and speaker joel rosenberg announcing america is on the road to collapse and implosion and former arkansas gov mike huckabee warning grimly we are living in some very dangerous times the third year of the event sponsored by the selfdescribed christcentered organization that seeks to influence policy and elections brought big name politicians bobby jindal rick santorum ted cruz and rick perry to ames iowa this past weekend they were there to rally the republican base in the leadoff caucus state but the upbeat lovegodandcountry tone of previous events appeared at times to have been replaced by a somber calamitous note of foreboding even satan got a few mentions projected onto a giant screen to punctuate vander plaats remarks was a video filled with haunting images of osama bin laden adam lanza and the boston marathon bombings it depicted a rising national debt marijuana boys scouts gay rainbow flag and a woman holding up a keep abortion legal sign it ended with someone yelling god is dead hail satan sponsors and speakers still exalted matrimony and procreation in heterosexual relationships called for putting god back in the classroom and government and called abortion murder but this years message was the nation is in moral decline ignore it at your own peril that was even carried into foreign policy i am telling you all i live in the bible belt i see these assholes everyday they are powerful and they vote rosenberg an evangelical christian born to a jewish father said the united states must not support a twostate solution in israel because a sovereign palestinian state defies the biblical mandate interesting that a christian american would presume to tell palestinian muslims they dont deserve a homeland because of what the bible says this follows an evangelical belief that jews from around the world will gather in israel where the second coming of christ will occur and – though rosenberg didnt spell this out – be converted to christianity god loves you but if we dont receive christ there are consequences rosenberg warned is fear a new strategy for the family leader and its affiliated family research council and focus on the family is it a response to flagging interest and political losses organizers said there were 1200 attendees and that there has been steady growth in three years but many seats were empty is it a concession theyre losing the battle over abortion and gay rights abortion has not been completely outlawed even under a conservative us supreme court majority having succeeded in getting three justices of the iowa supreme court voted out over samesex marriage a few years ago the family leader failed in its more recent campaign against a fourth samesex couples are celebrating wedding anniversaries with children and grandchildren and the planet has survived what the planet might not ultimately survive – global warming – wasnt on the agenda in fact if this were a true gathering of faith leaders one might have expected some commitment to keeping the environment healthy some compassion for the poor and immigrants there were calls for abolishing the entire tax system that sustains the poor in times of need there were calls for boosting border patrols to turn back young asylum seekers before their cases are heard iowas governor terry branstad boasted of having cut 1400 state employees and cut property taxes which fund education more than ever in iowa history but if it were a political forum to vet candidates a jewish muslim agnostic or atheist one would have had no place there in one video billy

was arrested for disorderly conduct after cursing in the presence of her two daughters wjbf news channel 6 reports according to the incident report from the north augusta department of public safety wolf yelled at her children told them to stop squishing the fcking bread and used similar phrases multiple times another woman at the store then approached the mother and asked her to stop using that language with her children but wolf insists this is not what happened shes like you told that they were smashing the bread and i said no i said that to my husband that he was smashing the bread by throwing the frozen pizzas on top of it she told wjbf but the woman who was referred to ms smith in the police report and later identified as michelle by nbc affiliate wagt reported wolf to the authorities leading to the mothers arrest for disorderly conduct he was like youre under arrest right in front of kids in front of my husband in front of customers wolf told wjbf of the officer who approached her in the store she added i didnt harm nobody i didnt hurt nobody the lady said she was having a bad day so because youre having a bad day youre going to ruin somebodys life well

good morning media reports based on the sheriffs statement on robin williams death are still saying the cause of his death is a suspected suicide f rom the new york times the marin county sheriffs office said in a statement that it suspects the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia an investigation was underway the statement said that the office received a 911 call at 1155 am pacific time saying that a man had been found unconscious and not breathing inside his residence emergency personnel sent to the scene identified him as mr williams and pronounced him dead at 1202 pm i cant help but be curious about this–does that make me a bad person my mind keeps going over possible scenarios wondering how he died and why it isnt clearly a suicide i hope well eventually find out what happened so i can stop having disturbing visual thoughts about it as someone who has strugged with depression and addiction i can understand the agony that must have driven williams to take his own life but i wish he had reached out to someone first the nyt article has some interesting background on williams childhood that i had never heard before the privileged son of a detroit auto executive who grew up chubby and lonesome playing by himself with 2000 toy soldiers in an empty room of a suburban mansion mr williams as a boy hardly fit the stereotype of someone who would grow to become a brainy comedian or a goofy one but he was both this morning the detroit free press republished an article from 1996 in which williams talks about his childhood home the interview took place before the release of the film jack its gone it doesnt exist anymore says williams the winsome memory of his childhood sanctuary written all over his face of course everything is written on williams face he might as well have a sign in his hair that says post bills here williams plays an overgrown — and i mean way overgrown — 10yearold child in jack which opens friday hes recalling his own childhood in bloomfield hills in a home at the corner of woodward and long lake which in his memory was little short of a fairyland it was a giant beautiful old mansion with a gatehouse an empty garage with room for 25 cars barns and there was a very wonderful old english man mr williams who looked after the gardens williams says he is looking out the balcony window of his los angeles hotel suite onto a busy street but williams clearly is visualizing the past we didnt own it we just rented it says williams whose father was an auto executive then we moved to chicago and when we came back to detroit a few years later we just lived in an apartment and it was very different you know but the first house it was so wonderful so peaceful there was no one for miles around only this giant golf course with people named tad whacking the old ball its a nice interview you can read the rest at the link thinking about robin williams movies reminded me that my dad and i went to see robert altmans popeye together in 1980 when i was home in indiana for a visit that was williams very first film we both really enjoyed it williams was perfect as popeye and shelley duvall was a marvelous olive oyl the new york daily news has a nice list of williams finest performances from popeye to good will hunting the actors most iconic roles of course williams has a boston connection too he won an academy award for his role in good will hunting a great scene from the movie was shot on a bench in boston garden from the hollywood reporter robin williams memorial pops up at good will hunting bench the bench that

rabchenuk tells the hollywood reporter they brought flowers and chalk and found two fans already sitting on the bench the four of them teamed up to write lines from good will hunting on the ground

all yesterday boston boomer made a wish in the comment section i wish something good would happen in the news oh yesme too i think there are many of us out there who do agree with her things have gotten way outta control and for someone in my situationhonestly i have checked out even bbs awesome post last week about timewarner being sold to murdock the only thing running through my brain was oh nowhat will happen to turner classic movies for that is the only thing saving my sanity these days i cant deal with war and torture and abandoned children its too much my usual outlet sarcastic humor is gone nothing can bring about a smartass remark or cheeky comment these daysim done so again i will just tread water today and give you a quick dump of links starting with a couple of assholes awful couple ditches baby with down syndrome with thai surrogate an anonymous australian couple has ignited a huge controversy after abandoning a baby they had using a surrogate because he had down syndrome and taking his healthy twin sister back to australia with them because humanity just wasnt insufferable enough because commercial surrogacy is outlawed in australia though they may use an altruistic surrogate who does not receive any payment outside medical expenses many couples seek options overseas to make things easier fertility clinics in places like thailand and india have become hotspots as they are a much easier options for overseas parentstobe and poorer indian women can make a considerable amount of money from surrogacy pattaramon chanbua of thailand agreed to be a surrogate for the unnamed australian couple in question according to sydney morning herald pattaramon discovered she was having twins three months after being injected with the australian womans fertilized eggs and was promised an additional sum of money the next month they discovered one of the babies had down syndrome when the agency informed the australian couple they said they were not going to take the boy and allegedly asked her to have an abortion—which she refused when she gave birth to the twins in december of last year the agent took the healthy baby girl and left her with the baby boy pattaramon claims that she has yet to be fully compensated by the agency she has never met the australian parents pattaramon 21 is already the mother of two children and was expecting to use the surrogacy money to provide for her family educating her children and repaying debts now she has been left with a much more considerable burden as there is no way she can afford the medical bills necessary to treat the baby named gammy she stated via the guardian why does he have to be abandoned while the other baby has it easy i feel sorry for him i dont know what to do i chose to have him not to hurt him i love him he was in my tummy for nine months its like my child i treat him like my other children never think you are not my child and i dont care for you never as you can see below the bbc is taking the australian side of the story bbc news – calls for clearer surrogacy rules after thai downs case surrogacy campaigners have called for clearer regulation after a thai woman was left with a downs syndrome baby when his parents refused to take him the boy whose twin sister was taken to australia by the unidentified couple needs urgent medical care the surrogate mother in thailand says she will raise the boy as her own and an online campaign has raised 185000 £110000 for his treatment the case has raised fears australia could ban international surrogacy the baby boy named gammy has a congenital heart condition and a lung infection as well as downs syndrome he is currently receiving urgent treatment in a thai hospital the surrogate mother tells abc news i love him hes like my child now rachel kunde the groups executive director said she hoped the case would lead to better regulation by the australian authorities of international surrogacy rather than an outright ban our greatest fear is that australia is going to ban international surrogacy altogether she said we are hoping that the government will make accessing surrogates in australia easier nicola scott a british lawyer specialising in fertility issues says a lack of regulation leaves the child vulnerable because issues such as termination are not discussed in advance she says the answer to the problem is an international treaty similar to the hague adoption convention so that parents know what the situation is from the outset then each country would have its own rules and regulations and the parents surrogates and children would be protected she added then you have the independent thai surrogate mother of abandoned downs twin gammy will keep him and says she doesnt blame australian couple displaying a generosity of spirit in rank contrast to the apparent callousness of the australian couple who abandoned a downs syndrome baby born to a thai surrogate mother the young woman has declined offers to adopt him announcing that she intends to bring him up herself the offers – along with donations of as of last night more than a164000 £90780 – were made by wellwishers following publicity about the plight of sixmonthold gammy who was spurned by his biological parents after pattharamon janbua 21 gave birth to twins the couple who have not been named took gammys healthy twin sister back to australia ms janbua said that after her experience she would advise no thai woman to get into this business wow the jezebel article mentions the amount of disabled babies that are left abandoned by biological parents who use these surrogatesit is disgusting to think they would leave their children to rot in third world conditionsa hell and many times leave the mothers who acted as surrogates holding the bag er baby if you will there has been a lot of noise about this eschaton wanker of the day barack obama that link will take you to this its not easy to hold the cia accountable by martin longman political animal the washington monthly then look here hullabaloo he called the torturers patriots by digby and then lectured the american people that we are not to be sanctimonious about it because they had a tough job we tortured some folks we did some things that were contrary to our values i understand why it happened i think its important when we look back to recall how afraid people were after the twin towers fell and the pentagon had been hit and the plane in pennsylvania had fallen and people did not know whether more attacks were imminent and there was enormous pressure on our law enforcement and our national security teams to try to deal with this and its important for us not to feel too sanctimonious in retrospect about the tough job that those folks had and a lot of those folks were working hard under enormous pressure and are real patriots these folks are big on sending messages what message do you suppose that sent when a patriot has a tough job we cant expect him to adhere to the law or norms or even basic morality looks like it good to know i remember reading somewhere during the whole torture debate that the right thing to do was to keep torture officially illegal for deniability but do it anyway and then throw yourself on the mercy of the people afterwards telling them that it was necessary to protect them that way you could keep up the pretense that we were a civilized nation while being allowed to take the gloves off for our own good mind you looks like thats the new sop sop like i said i have not fully read those links there i can not process it so i just post these and take it from there another digby hullabaloo the keepers of the secrets by digby conor friedersdorf speculates about the power someone like john brennan must have over a president who has ordered killings overseas i am not suggesting that brennan is blackmailing obama or even that he would necessarily retaliate if fired still if obama is like most people in positions of power he fires no subordinate without first asking himself could this person damage me if obama is a normal person rather than an unusually principled person the answer factors into

have you ever swum in the warm water of a lake in summer and found when treading water that your feet suddenly became uncomfortably cold if so you experienced something that limnologists experts on lakes describe by the rather splendid and poeticsounding pair epilimnion and hypolimnion when the sun heats a smallish body of water the topmost layer of water warms up but because warm water is less dense than cold it stays on top that top area is the epilimnion the cold water below it which may not warm up much during the summer if the lake is at all deep is the hypolimnion the root of both epilimnion and hypolimnion is the classical greek limnion the diminutive of limne a lake limnologist and the subject of study limnology are very closely related — they derive from limne epi is greek

ceasefire to begin saturday however the temporary lull was unlikely to change the trajectory of the current hostilities amid ominous signs that the gaza war is spilling over into the west bank in a day of rage palestinians across the territory which had been relatively calm for years staged protests against israels gaza operation and the rising casualty toll there in the west bank at least six

previous israeli assaults the toll on civilians has raised united nations concerns of the israeli use of disproportionate force in gaza in violation of international humanitarian law but the use of disproportionate force and the targeting of civilian infrastructure isnt a new or surprising tactic for israel in fact its a primary strategy according to gabi siboni head of the military and

and recommending that those already there leave immediately the libyan government has not been able to adequately build its military and police forces and improve security it said many militarygrade weapons remain in the hands of private individuals including antiaircraft weapons that may be used against civilian aviation we are committed to supporting the libyan people during this challenging

republicans might impeach obama over immigration pesident obama will propose broadranging executive action on immigration reform later this summer that could provoke republicans into trying to impeach him a senior white house official said friday while details of the immigration plan are still being worked on it will mark an important step in the arc of the presidency that will shape both the substance and politics of immigration policy for years white house senior advisor dan pfeiffer told reporters at a breakfast sponsored by the christian science monitor that move is certain to increase the angry reaction from republicans who already accuse obama of exceeding his executive authority pfeiffer said highlighting recent statements by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin in which she backed an impeachment move i would not discount the possibility that republicans would seek to impeach obama he said adding that house speaker john a boehner rohio has opened the door to impeachment by his plans to sue obama for allegedly exceeding his executive authority is this just an effort by the white house to put the impeachment question out there so americans can let the gop what they think about it the hill reports white house taking impeachment seriously senior white house advisers are taking very seriously the possibility that republicans in congress will try to impeach president obama especially if he takes executive action to slow deportations dan pfeiffer a senior adviser to obama said friday that the white house is taking the prospect of impeachment in the gopcontrolled house more seriously than many others in washington who see it as unlikely pfeiffer noted that former alaska gov sarah palin who has a large following among tea party conservatives has called for obamas impeachment and a large block of the gops base favors it i saw a poll today that had a huge portion of the republican party base saying they supported impeaching the president a lot of people in this town laugh that off i would not discount that possibility he told reporters friday at a breakfast sponsored by the christian science monitor pfeiffer said speaker john boehners rohio decision to file a lawsuit against obama over his use of executive actions increased the chance of impeachment proceedings in the future a little reality testing from sean sullivan at the wapo these two numbers show why impeachment talk is trouble for the gop by about 21 americans say they dont think president obama should be impeached and removed from office according to a new cnnorc international poll released friday but a majority of republicans disagree that in a nutshell is why talk about impeaching the president is nothing but trouble for the gop heading toward the november midterms sixtyfive percent of americans say obama should not be impeached compared to just 33 percent who say he should very onesided its clear that impeachment is a political loser when it comes to the public as a whole the public as a whole numbers matter because with most of the consequential primaries behind us republican candidates in key senate races — the battle for the senate is the main

plane is back in the headlines associated press reports via ctv sydney australia — investigators looking into the disappearance of the malaysia airlines plane are confident it was on autopilot when it crashed in a remote stretch of the indian ocean australian officials said thursday as they announced the latest shift in the search for the jet after analyzing data exchanged between the plane and a satellite officials believe flight 370 was on autopilot the entire time it was flying across a vast expanse of the southern indian ocean based on the straight path it took australian transport safety bureau chief commissioner martin dolan said certainly for its path across the indian ocean we are confident that the aircraft was operating on autopilot until it ran out of fuel dolan told reporters in canberra the nations capital asked whether the autopilot would have to be manually switched on or whether it could have been activated automatically under a default setting dolan replied the basic assumption would be that if the autopilot is operational its because its been switched on but exactly why the autopilot would have been set on a flight path so far off course from the jets destination of beijing and exactly when it was switched on remains unknown the new york times explains what likely happened a report issued by the australian transport safety bureau outlining how the new search zone had been chosen said that the most likely scenario as the aircraft headed south across the indian ocean on march 8 was that the crew was suffering from hypoxia or was otherwise unresponsive hypoxia occurs when a plane loses air pressure and the pilots lacking adequate oxygen become confused and incapable of performing even basic manual tasks pilots are trained to put on oxygen masks immediately if an aircraft suffers depressurization their masks have an hours air supply compared with only a few minutes for the passengers the plane which left kuala lumpur malaysia bound for beijing with 239 people aboard made its turn south toward the indian ocean about an hour after it stopped responding to airtraffic controllers evidence for an unresponsive crew as the plane flew south includes the loss of radio communications a long period with no maneuvering of the aircraft a steadily maintained cruise altitude and eventual fuel exhaustion and descent the report said given these observations the final stages of the unresponsive crewhypoxia event type appeared to best fit the available evidence for the final period of mh370s flight when it was heading in a generally southerly direction the document said based on the report a new search zone has been designated according to the la times experts from boeing and the us national transportation safety board were among the specialists who helped define the zone based on satellite data and analysis of previous similar incidents the new zone about 1100 miles west of perth australia is farther south than where previous intensive search efforts were carried out this spring after the plane vanished march 8 with 239 people aboard the flight was en route from kuala lumpur to beijing when it went missing australia deputy prime minister warren truss said the search was continuing with a mapping of the ocean floor in the newly defined area to be followed by a comprehensive seafloor search the seafloor search he said should start around august and be completed within one year the area is 58 miles wide and 400 miles long covering an area as big as lake huron the secondlargest of the us great lakes by comparison the area searched with a robotic sonarequipped submarine in may was about 330 square miles first gay marriage license issued in indiana there was exciting news yesterday in the struggle to legalize samesex marriage state by state from npr federal judges reverse gaymarriage bans in utah indiana utah and indiana are the latest states to see their bans on samesex marriage struck down by a federal court following rulings in both states wednesday that found the prohibition unconstitutional in utah the 10th circuit court of appeals panel upheld a lower court ruling striking down the states gaymarriage ban and in indiana us district judge richard young made a similar ruling it is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of samesex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of oppositesex couples the threejudge panel in the utah case said the panel immediately put the ruling on hold pending its appeal either to the entire 10th circuit or directly to the us supreme court according to the associated press in indiana young wrote samesex couples who would otherwise qualify to marry in indiana have the right to marry in indiana these couples when gender and sexual orientation are taken away are in all respects like the family down the street the constitution demands that we treat them as such both decisions are significant in that they may influence decisions in other states carl tobias a law professor at the university of richmond writes npr in an email that the utah decision is very significant as it is the first appellate court to address the marriage equality issue the 4th circuit in virginia may well apply the reasoning of the 10th circuit opinion as will numerous district courts that have yet to rule he says the indiana ruling invalidating its ban today also used similar reasoning tobias says all courts are finding that the bans violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th amendment in

coming up even against one of the cup favorites germany team usa was greeted with cheers from american fans wednesday as they arrived in the brazilian city of recife players spent the three days

said wednesday we are by no means any underdog here in this tournament but we know its the biggest hurdle we have to take now with germany klinsman suggested that us fans should take a day off work to watch the game and wrote a letter to bosses asking them to excuse their employees absences reports reuters in the style of a doctors note klinsmann addresses employers and asks them to forgive their staff for their absence the letter was distributed on social networks by the us soccer i understand that this absence may reduce the productivity of your workplace but i can assure you that it is for

lots all the focus on permutations and goaldifferential scenarios has undercut the importance of todays game for american soccer theres not as much at stake goes the implication because we can move ahead even if we lose to germany but this is about more than getting to the next round this is an opportunity for the us to face one of soccers elite teams on the biggest stage and prove it can hang with—even beat—any country in this world cup before the tournament most people thought it would be an unlikely success for the us just to get out of the socalled group of death and to the round of 16 now after beating ghana and dominating much of the game against portugal the us can dream bigger beat germany and america wins its group for the second straight world cup a result nearly unthinkable when the draw was announced in december beat germany and the us secures a favorable round of 16 match most likely against algeria or russia rather than a trickier faceoff with sneakygood belgium just as important a win would mean that the americans have defeated one of soccers oligarchs at a world cup with both sides trying their best for a victory that by itself would be a precedentsetting result people in oklahoma are beginning to ask questions about why their state has been having so many earthquakes all of a sudden according to the globegazzettecom barbara brown poses for a photo on the front step of her home that now sits about one foot off the surface of her lawn saturday june 21 2014 in reno texas oklahoma city ap — oklahoma residents whose homes and nerves have been shaken by an upsurge in earthquakes want to know whats causing the temblors — and what can be done to stop them hundreds of people are expected to turn out in edmond oklahoma on thursday night for a town hall meeting on the issue earthquakes used to be almost unheard of on the vast stretches of prairie that unfold across texas kansas and oklahoma but theyve become common in recent years oklahoma recorded nearly 150 between january and the start of may though most have been too weak to cause serious damage or endanger lives theyve raised suspicions that the shaking might be connected to the oil and gas drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing especially the wells in which the industry disposes of its wastewater now after years of being harangued by anxious residents governments in all three states are confronting the issue reviewing scientific data holding public discussions and considering new regulations thursdays meeting in oklahoma will include the state agency that regulates oil and gas drilling and the oklahoma geological survey gee do you suppose it could have anything to do with fracking and what about all that wastewater that has to be disposed of in the fracking process from techsonia fracking fluid spills release colloids that pollute groundwater according to a new research wastewater contains substances that bind to pollutants and their release in soil leads to the ground water contamination as they get along with the water when it is soaked by earth in this study flowback fluid from hydraulic fracturing was analyzed colloids are the charged particles and larger than molecules and have the potency to bind to sand grains with the wastewater colloids get released in to the ground water this study was published in the journal of the american chemical society and was conducted by the researchers at the cornell universitys college of agriculture and life sciences this study was done to determine the remaining colloids amounts in groundwater when the above soil got exposed to flowback fliud in a hydrofracking spills ugh one last story scientists have unearthed interesting facts about oldest human faeces show neanderthals ate vegetables found at a dig in

            "text": "Time lapse photography is something that fascinates me, I think we can look at a picture of a time lapse image and see a metaphor for life. Movement, continuous and repetitive.\n\nThere are a couple of types of time lapse photography….the short exposure kind which takes a normal exposure of sequential pictures over many hours or even days and edit them into one photograph.\n\n\n\nOr the long exposure method, where the camera shutter remains open for a long period of time and exposes the film to the image it is photographing.\n\nThese particular long exposed photos are blurred in appearance.  Creating a glowing, disoriented, disturbed, ghostlike, or drugged feeling when you look at them.\n\nIt seems as if we are living in a time lapsed state of mind, as you have been reading the Boston Boomer’s and Dak’s coverage of late, the mess in Missouri is just the result of what has been building over time. Like the images you will see below throughout the post…the same scenarios have been played out all over the US. The actual persons involved may be different, but the general characteristics are the same. When we see the reports of racial violence play out on the news, we feel that repetition. Like the time lapsed images, the scenes become blurred. Yet we know what happens at the end of the shot. There is a good example of the differences in media treatment of violence here by the way: When The Media Treats White Suspects And Killers Better Than Black Victims be sure to look at that….No need to belabor the point, I will just let this op/ed by Farai Chideya from the Guardian do that for me.\n\n(One note however, it makes a uncomfortable point when Rand Paul gets a pat on the back from a black woman…considering the neocon racist misogynistic shit he usually spews…but you’ll get the point the author is making.) On race, America has far to go. Ferguson won’t be the last flash point\n\n\n\nI spent my very early years in New York, living a very multiracial Sesame Street life, a big swinging bellbottom of a childhood. And then our family moved to Baltimore and the iron curtain of the “colour line” fell. I felt that I had moved from the 1970s through a time warp where black and white were the only two colours and never the twain shall socially meet. I grew to understand what the 50s were actually like in Baltimore, when my mother, for example, was permitted to buy clothes from the major department store but not try them on. (Heaven forfend some black lady should be in the dressing room, right? You know they leave a residue of blackness on the clothes.) America has never had one racial reality, but a series of them strung together from San Antonio to Pittsburgh to Appalachia. What we are seeing in Ferguson, Missouri, is the result of life in a specific type of heavily racialised zone. Yes, a city such as New York, where a black man was recently choked to death by police officers, has its own very clear forms of racialisation and it’s a national issue. But the police killing, last week, of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen in Ferguson has sparked national protests because it represents a specific type of racialisation. This is of the majority black city, big or small, with a white economic and political power structure.\n\n\n\nRead the whole opinion piece. This is the part about Rand Paul though, it comes in comparison to Obama’s reactions to Ferguson’s Police Departments militarization:\n\nAfter the killing of another black youth, Trayvon Martin, Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote a seminal piece for Atlantic magazine called “Fear of a Black President”, describing President Obama as “conservative… in the very sphere where he holds singular gravity – race.” Two years later, with Ferguson, the president still holds tight to that caution about addressing racial inequality. In terms of day-to-day Washington governance, there is no fear of a black president. Congress fears him not, certainly not the Republicans and not even some members of his own party. And now, with a particularly tepid and circular statement on Ferguson, the president has gone even further. He seems obsessed with convincing white Americans he is not some goblin come to take their privilege away, rather than recognising that, pragmatically, America still has enough deeply held racial biases that he will be perceived as a race man by some, no matter what he does. (Black Americans learned his political strategy on race early in his first term, as a group of leaders of African American organisations came to ask for more White House focus on jobs in black communities and were rebuffed. They held their televised press conference outside the White House in a snowstorm, a nature-made bathetic fallacy.) L ast week, the president delivered a speech that seemed to weigh police intimidation and harassment of protesters and press with acts of vandalism almost equally. “Put simply, we all need to hold ourselves to a high standard, particularly those of us in positions of authority,” he said. “Let’s remember that we’re all part of one American family.” In this diffuse speech, the president could have spoken out more forcefully against the militarisation of local police forces, as Republican Rand Paul has done. He could have tackled the unacceptable level and variety of unwarranted stops, searches and frisking of black men in particular. For bonus points, he could have gotten into black incarceration rates or, as author Michelle Alexander puts it, the “New Jim Crow”.\n\nYou can read the rest at the link.  That is something…when an asshole like Rand gets kudos from a black woman who has the phrase “New Jim Crow” in the same paragraph.  But I think I get her point….yes? I don’t know. Don’t get me wrong, I agree with her, but she could have pick a different politician to highlight…am I right? Let’s not forget that Paul is the dude who didn’t support the Civil Rights Act…no matter what shit he says now: Wash. Post Recasts Rand Paul As Civil Rights Ally, Forgetting Their Own Reporting | Blog | Media Matters for America\n\nAnyway…I need to move on.\n\nIn another Op/Ed, this one from the Sprinfield News-Leader, which is quoted as, “This editorial is the view of the News-Leader Editorial Board, Linda Ramey-Greiwe, President and Publisher, Paul Berry, Executive Director, Cheryl Whitsitt, Managing Editor.” Our Voice: Rights lost in Ferguson riots\n\nIt is very good, and I feel it is too important not to quote the entire thing:\n\nOn Aug. 9, unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson at 12:01 p.m. in Ferguson. A vigil on Aug. 10 turned violent. The situation deteriorated from there. Riots and arrests. Tear gas and rubber bullets. Real bullets, riot gear and military-grade displays of force. Injuries to both protesters and police. Looting and needless destruction of property. For four straight nights, the clashes escalated, the national media descended, and still, no clear information was put forth about the death of a young, unarmed black man. After a day of relative calm gave hope that the situation was beginning to defuse, tempers flared again Friday. As unrest continues, the blame game is already underway. At this point, it would be easy to join in on the finger-pointing based on half-truths. It would be easy join the chorus of voices calling out our elected leaders, Gov. Nixon, U.S. Sens. McCaskill and Blunt and President Obama, for waiting so long to intervene. It would be easy to place blame on the protesters for turning violent and rioting, citing the need for peaceful assembly. It would be easy to hoist the burden of responsibility onto local authorities in Ferguson for their poor handling of the situation, inciting protesters to riot rather than bringing calm. It would be easy to join in blaming the media for stirring up the situation by giving attention to it. It would be easy to, as some are now doing, blame the young man himself for allegedly participating in a theft prior to his altercation with the police. But there is nothing easy about the situation in Ferguson. A solution for the community will take doing the hard work. Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol is doing the hard work. Rather than waging a battle, Johnson is working to open the lines of communication and erase the artificial boundaries between authorities and protesters. State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal and St. Louis alderman Antonio French are doing the hard work. Providing on-the-ground leadership, standing up to rioters, calling for peaceful protests and documenting events on Twitter, their work is reason to hope that the community will make it through this crisis. There is no shortage of people being thrust forward to take the blame for what has happened in Ferguson. But at this moment, as the nation watches a community teetering on the edge of chaos, we must take the time to examine exactly what we are losing. An unarmed young man was shot and killed by police. His right to due process was violated, which demands an explanation. With an investigation underway, it is our duty as citizens to care as much about the process and outcome of the investigations by the FBI and Department of Justice as we do the riots. As the black community in Ferguson protested, it was met with aggression, intimidation and eventual force from authorities. Some people rioted, which cannot be condoned in our society and should be dealt with. But many assembled peacefully, and were met with the same treatment. Peacefully assembled crowds had their rights violated as well. We must seek answers as to why. Two reporters, Wesley Lowery of the Washington Post and Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, were taken into custody as they tried to follow police orders to leave a McDonald’s restaurant, where they were working. Other journalists were specifically told to stop reporting what was happening. Again, rights were violated, this time in an attempt to silence the press that is promised to remain free. Blame is as easy to assign as it is to dodge. At some point, someone will “take responsibility” for what happened. Over the past several years, this has come to mean little more than an acceptance that people will think poorly of the person for a few weeks. Or until the next big outrage comes along to distract us. As Americans and Missourians thankful for the rights afforded to us by our Constitution, we must not lose interest in these events because the spectacle stops. Now is the time to wade through the rhetoric in order to hold our government and society accountable for what is happening in Ferguson. It’s the only way we’ll manage to restore those rights.\n\nGood for the Springfield News-Leader! Damn glad there is a press out there near the heart of the situation that is keeping check on things.  The News-Leader is a Gannett newspaper…\n\nAs I was getting ready to shut down the laptop, these headlines caught my attention:\n\nFerguson On Edge On First Night With Curfew Huffington Post\n\nOkay. Next up, another op/ed, a link from last week: Rekha Basu: Iowa summit serves reminder of why religion, politics don’t mix | Opinion | McClatchy DC\n\nOf everything coming out of this year’s Iowa Family Leadership Summit, the fear factor is what stayed with me. It was a constant, discomfiting undercurrent, like a loose nail poking up in your shoe. It was organization President Bob Vander Plaats declaring this a time of “spiritual warfare,” and speaker Joel Rosenberg announcing America is “on the road to collapse” and “implosion,” and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, warning grimly, “We are living in some very dangerous times.” The third year of the event sponsored by the self-described Christ-centered organization that seeks to influence policy and elections, brought big name politicians Bobby Jindal, Rick Santorum, Ted Cruz and Rick Perry to Ames, Iowa, this past weekend. They were there to rally the Republican base in the lead-off caucus state. But the upbeat, love-God-and-country tone of previous events appeared at times to have been replaced by a somber, calamitous note of foreboding. Even Satan got a few mentions. Projected onto a giant screen to punctuate Vander Plaats’ remarks was a video filled with haunting images of Osama bin Laden, Adam Lanza and the Boston marathon bombings. It depicted a rising national debt, marijuana, Boys Scouts, gay rainbow flag and a woman holding up a “Keep abortion legal” sign. It ended with someone yelling, “God is dead. Hail Satan!” Sponsors and speakers still exalted matrimony and procreation in heterosexual relationships, called for putting God back in the classroom and government, and called abortion murder. But this year’s message was: The nation is in moral decline. Ignore it at your own peril. That was even carried into foreign policy.\n\nI am telling you all, I live in the bible belt. I see these assholes everyday. They are powerful. And they vote.\n\nRosenberg, an evangelical Christian born to a Jewish father, said the United States must not support a two-state solution in Israel because a sovereign Palestinian state “defies the biblical mandate.” Interesting that a Christian American would presume to tell Palestinian Muslims they don’t deserve a homeland because of what the Bible says. This follows an evangelical belief that Jews from around the world will gather in Israel, where the second coming of Christ will occur and – though Rosenberg didn’t spell this out – be converted to Christianity. “God loves you but if we don’t receive Christ, there are consequences,” Rosenberg warned. Is fear a new strategy for the Family Leader and its affiliated Family Research Council and Focus on the Family? Is it a response to flagging interest and political losses? Organizers said there were 1,200 attendees, and that there has been steady growth in three years. But many seats were empty. Is it a concession they’re losing the battle over abortion and gay rights? Abortion has not been completely outlawed, even under a conservative U.S. Supreme Court majority. Having succeeded in getting three justices of the Iowa Supreme Court voted out over same-sex marriage, a few years ago, the Family Leader failed in its more recent campaign against a fourth. Same-sex couples are celebrating wedding anniversaries with children and grandchildren, and the planet has survived. What the planet might not ultimately survive – global warming – wasn’t on the agenda. In fact, if this were a true gathering of faith leaders, one might have expected some commitment to keeping the environment healthy, some compassion for the poor and immigrants. There were calls for abolishing the entire tax system that sustains the poor in times of need. There were calls for boosting border patrols to turn back young asylum seekers before their cases are heard. Iowa’s governor, Terry Branstad, boasted of having cut 1,400 state employees and cut property taxes, which fund education, more than ever in Iowa history. But if it were a political forum to vet candidates, a Jewish, Muslim, agnostic or atheist one would have had no place there. In one video, Billy Graham’s daughter, Anne Graham Lotz, said, “The only place you get right with God is at the foot of the cross of Jesus Christ.”\n\nAs with the other links, I urge you to read it all. That blurred scene that distorts and disturbs….you can feel it!\n\nOn the ridiculous notion, I must say this could have been me: South Carolina Mom Arrested For Cursing In Front Of Her Kids\n\nParents, it looks like it’s time to be ever-vigilant about your choice of words. Dropping an F-bomb in front of your kids can land you in jail. Mom Danielle Wolf was grocery shopping at a Kroger store in North Augusta, South Carolina when she was arrested for disorderly conduct after cursing in the presence of her two daughters, WJBF News Channel 6 reports. According to the incident report from the North Augusta Department Of Public Safety, Wolf yelled at her children, told them to “stop squishing the f*cking bread,” and used “similar phrases multiple times.” Another woman at the store then approached the mother and asked her to stop using that language with her children. But Wolf insists this is not what happened. “She’s like, ‘you told that they were smashing the bread’, and I said ‘no’ I said that to my husband, that he was smashing the bread by throwing the frozen pizzas on top of it,” she told WJBF. But the woman, who was referred to “Ms. Smith” in the police report and later identified as “Michelle” by NBC affiliate WAGT, reported Wolf to the authorities, leading to the mother’s arrest for disorderly conduct. “He was like, ‘You’re under arrest’… right in front of kids, in front of my husband, in front of customers,” Wolf told WJBF of the officer who approached her in the store. She added, “I didn’t harm nobody. I didn’t hurt nobody. The lady said she was having a bad day. So, because you’re having a bad day you’re going to ruin somebody’s life.”\n\nPerhaps arresting the mother in front of her kids was more traumatic than telling the dumbass husband to stop “squishing the fucking bread.”\n\nIn the world of Amazon and the Washington Post, a buck is a buck: Bezos-owned Washington Post now inserting gross Amazon affiliate links into news articles | PandoDaily\n\nShit. What do you think will come next?  Brought to you by Carl’s Jr.\n\nThis post is getting real…real…real long so let’s just link dump for a bit. After the jump.\n\nRead the rest of this entry »",

            "text": "A federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled for the first time that states must allow gay couples to marry, finding the Constitution protects same-sex relationships and putting a remarkable legal winning streak across the country one step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe three-judge panel in Denver found it “wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of the love and commitment between same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples.”\n\nThe decision upheld a lower court ruling that struck down Utah’s gay marriage ban. However, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel immediately put Wednesday’s ruling on hold so it could be appealed, either to the entire 10th Circuit or directly to the nation’s highest court.\n\n“All I can say is that we are thrilled,” said Kody Partridge, one of the Utah plaintiffs. She was working in the garden with her wife, Laurie Wood, when they heard about the ruling.\n\n“This is such as historic thing, not just for Utah but for Laurie and me” and plaintiffs across the country, Partridge said. “This is a big day.”\n\nThe decision gives increased momentum to a legal cause that already compiled an impressive winning streak in the lower courts after the Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates.\n\nThe latest of those rulings was in Indiana, where a federal judge on Wednesday struck down that state’s same-sex marriage ban in a ruling that immediately allows gay couples to wed.\n\nTwo of the most striking lower court rulings were in the conservative states of Utah and Oklahoma, which saw their voter-approved gay marriage bans overturned in December and January, respectively. In Utah, more than 1,000 same-sex couples wed before the Supreme Court issued a stay.\n\nThe 10th Circuit panel considered both cases. It did not rule on the Oklahoma ban.\n\nThough the Utah and Oklahoma cases have been closely watched, it is unclear whether they will be the first to reach the Supreme Court. The high court could choose from cases moving through five other federal appellate courts, and wouldn’t consider a case until next year at the earliest.\n\nAttorneys representing Utah and Oklahoma argued voters have the right to define marriage in their states. Gay rights lawyers countered that they cannot do so in a way that deprives gay people of their fundamental rights.\n\nThe appellate ruling comes 42 years after the Supreme Court refused to hear a case of two men who were refused a marriage license in Minnesota, finding there was no legal issue for the justices to consider, and just 10 years after 11 states voted to outlaw gay marriage.\n\nNow same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Recent polls show a majority of Americans support it.\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE? CLICK HERE FOR VIDEO.",

Williams, Correspondent\n\n Christian Action League\n\n June 26, 2014\n\nDENVER — Wednesday’s 2-1 ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court opens the door to same-sex marriage in Utah, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Wyoming, although it has been stayed pending appeal.\n\nAlso this week, a federal judge struck down Indiana’s marriage protection amendment in a decision that immediately allows homosexual couples in the Hoosier state to wed.\n\nEven as the rulings led to celebration among gay forces, conservatives reminded their supporters that the courts don’t have the final say.\n\n“While judges can, by judicial fiat, declare same-sex ‘marriage’ legal, they will never be able to make it right,” said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins. “The courts, for all their power, can’t overturn natural law.”\n\nThe Utah attorney general’s office has announced it will appeal the decision by a three-judge panel to uphold a lower court ruling striking down that state’s marriage protection amendment to the U.S. Supreme Court, but it hasn’t announced whether it will ask the entire 10th Circuit to review the ruling in the meantime.\n\nThe Utah case is especially significant as it marks the first time an appellate court has interpreted last year’s Supreme Court decision regarding same-sex marriage to mean that states cannot deny gays the right to marry.\n\n“We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right to marry, establish a family, raise children, and enjoy the full protection of a state’s marital laws. A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union,” the appellate court said.\n\nThe Rev. Mark Creech, executive director of the Christian Action League, called the ruling a travesty of justice and a trampling of states’ rights and thereby the rights of the people, agreeing with dissenting Judge Paul J. Kelly Jr.\n\n“If the States are the laboratories of democracy, requiring every state to recognize same-gender unions — contrary to the views of its electorate and representatives — [it] turns the notion of a limited national government on its head,” Kelly wrote. He further warned fellow justices that, “We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.”\n\nThis entry was posted on Thursday, June 26th, 2014 at 10:00 am and is filed under Christian Action League.

            "text": "A federal appeals court in Denver ruled Wednesday that gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to marry, moving the issue a giant step closer to a return engagement at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe 2-1 ruling by a three-judge panel striking down Utah's ban on same-sex marriage represents the first appellate ruling since the Supreme Court last year declared a portion of the federal Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional.\n\nThe 10th Circuit appeals court includes Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Wyoming, as well as New Mexico, where same-sex couples already can marry. Its precedent applies to all those states, but the panel blocked its ruling from taking effect pending appeal, and Utah's attorney general said he intended to seek Supreme Court review.\n\nThe decision, which upheld a federal district court verdict from December, is likely to be just one of many ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court. Last year's ruling by the high court granting federal recognition to same-sex marriages unleashed a string of 20 lower court rulings striking down state bans against gay marriage. The panel's 65-page ruling referred to that United States v. Windsor decision 37 times.\n\n\"We hold that under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution, those who wish to marry a person of the same sex are entitled to exercise the same fundamental right as is recognized for persons who wish to marry a person of the opposite sex,\" the panel ruled.\n\nIt held that Utah's constitutional amendment must be held up to heightened scrutiny, a standard that means its alleged justifications must require the prohibition. But it found those justifications -- from procreation to parenting skills -- wanting.\n\nIf appellants cannot tell us with any degree of confidence that they believe opposite-sex parenting produces better outcomes on the whole -- and they evidently cannot -- they fail to justify this palpable harm that the Supreme Court has unequivocally condemned.\n\n Three-judge panel, 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\n\n \"If appellants cannot tell us with any degree of confidence that they believe opposite-sex parenting produces better outcomes on the whole -- and they evidently cannot -- they fail to justify this palpable harm that the Supreme Court has unequivocally condemned,\" the court said.\n\n The decision was written by Judge Carlos Lucero, who was named to the appeals court by Bill Clinton, with Judge Jerome Holmes, a George W. Bush nominee, agreeing. Judge Paul Kelly, who was named by George H.W. Bush, dissented -- becoming the first judge in the past 18 months to come down against same-sex marriage.\n\n\"If the states are the laboratories of democracy, requiring every state to recognize same-gender unions -- contrary to the views of its electorate and representatives -- turns the notion of a limited national government on its head,\" Kelly said. \"We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nDespite the appeals court stay, the Boulder County Clerk's Office in Colorado began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples Wednesday after learning of the ruling.\n\n\"Couples across Colorado have been waiting a long time to have their right to marry the person they love recognized,\" said Hillary Hall, Boulder County clerk and recorder. \"I want to act immediately to let them carry out that wish.\"\n\nThe Colorado Attorney General's Office said the licenses will be invalid, as they were in 1975 when the Boulder County clerk issued a marriage license to two men.\n\nAt the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, the same three-judge panel heard Oklahoma's appeal of a similar federal district court ruling a week after Utah's appeal in April, so its decision in that case is expected soon. And a three-judge panel in Virginia heard another appeal in May.\n\nThe Supreme Court will have its choice of which case to consider, perhaps as early as the 2014 term beginning in October. It could choose a case involving an outright ban on same-sex marriage or one merely involving a state's refusal to recognize a marriage performed in another state.\n\nThe high court ruled a year ago in June that the federal government must recognize legal same-sex marriages, and it cleared the way for California to become the 13th state where gays and lesbians could marry. Since then, six other states legalized gay marriages by legislative action or court order -- New Jersey, New Mexico, Illinois, Hawaii and, most recently, Pennsylvania and Oregon.\n\nMore than 70 lawsuits are pending in all 31 states that still have prohibitions. Some raise specific issues such as divorce or death benefits.\n\nThe six plaintiffs in the Utah case include Laurie Wood and Kody Partridge, who were among more than 1,000 couples married in Utah before the Supreme Court put District Judge Robert Shelby's ruling on hold; Derek Kitchen and Moudi Sbeity, who have yet to marry; and Karen Archer and Kate Call, who want their Iowa marriage recognized in Utah.",

The one-hour flight was carried out by the environmental group Greenpeace, digital rights activists the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a conservative political organisation, the Tenth Amendment Centre. The 41 metre blimp, owned by Greenpeace, was adorned with a sign that read “NSA Illegal Spying Below”.\n\nIn an email to Reuters the agency declined to comment. But a spokesman did note there was no restricted airspace over the data centre, housed on the grounds of the Utah National Guard’s Camp Williams in Bluffdale, 23 miles (37km) south of Salt Lake City. The NSA says the facility provides the government with intelligence and warnings about cyber security threats. It is thought to be the agency’s largest data storage centre.\n\nThe blimp protest coincided with the launch of an online campaign that rates members of Congress on actions the activists say either further or stop data collection efforts by the NSA…\n\nIt’s right pleasing to an old activist like me to see an issue of human rights and privacy carry across ideological boundaries. The only one of the three groups that put this protest together that I’d ever find myself sharing a song together with – would be the EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nThe occasion is not one for differences but common ground. That being a government that has marched away from the heart of the constitution that is the foundation of this nation. Maybe they tip-toed because they didn’t want us to hear what they were doing. A whistleblower named Edward Snowden took care of that.\n\nHere’s a link to the website they were advertising with their flight. I hope it moves the cause of privacy forward, aids in bringing back the intent of a democratic United States of America.",

            "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY — A federal appeals court ruled Friday that Oklahoma must allow gay couples to wed, prompting a fast, angry response from leaders of a state that has vehemently fought policy changes brought on from outside its borders.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upheld a federal judge's ruling striking down Oklahoma's gay marriage ban, which had been approved by more than 75 percent of voters in 2004. Friday's decision marks the second time the federal appeals court has found the U.S. Constitution protects same-sex marriage.\n\nThe court put its 2-1 ruling on hold pending an appeal, meaning same-sex couples won't be allowed to marry in Oklahoma for now.\n\n\"Today's ruling is another instance of federal courts ignoring the will of the people and trampling on the right of states to govern themselves,\" Gov. Mary Fallin said. \"In this case, two judges have acted to overturn a law supported by Oklahomans.\"\n\nShe said she hoped the decision was overturned and pledged to \"fight back against our federal government when it seeks to ignore or change laws written and supported by Oklahomans.\"\n\nOklahoma has made a habit in recent years of battling federal laws and policies, with the state suing over health care reform, Environmental Protection Agency requirements and the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. The state last year also refused to process benefits for same-sex couples in the National Guard, instead ordering that those workers' benefits be processed at federal facilities.\n\nFriday's decision comes after the same three-judge panel ruled in June that Utah's ban on same-sex marriage violates the Constitution. That was the first time an appellate court determined that last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act meant states couldn't deny gays the ability to wed. That ruling also is on hold, and Utah's attorney general has said he plans to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nSharon Baldwin and Mary Bishop filed the Oklahoma lawsuit in 2004 after they were denied a marriage license from the Tulsa County clerk.\n\n\"We are so grateful that the 10th Circuit understands what more and more people across this country are beginning to realize — that gay and lesbian people are citizens who should enjoy the same rights as straight people under the law,\" the couple said in a statement.\n\nAttorneys representing the clerk said they were considering their options. They noted the panel's dissenting judge argued that changing the definition of marriage should belong to Oklahoma residents, not a federal court.\n\n\"Every child deserves a mom and a dad, and the people of Oklahoma confirmed that at the ballot box when they approved a constitutional amendment that affirmed marriage as a man-woman union,\" said Byron Babione, senior attorney for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which is defending the county clerk.\n\nProponents of gay marriage quickly planned rallies Friday in Oklahoma City and Tulsa to celebrate.\n\n\"We're living in a time now that's a completely different Oklahoma than the one I was raised in,\" said Troy Stevenson, 36, who recently returned to head up The Equality Network.\n\nHe said he believes the ruling in a conservative state like Oklahoma, which is often referred to as the buckle of the Bible Belt, has a special significance.\n\nDon Holladay, an attorney for Bishop and Baldwin, said the ruling bring the couple joy but is more than that.\n\n\"It's also a chance to celebrate for this whole state and to bring us forward, as this country moves on, in recognition of the equality and dignity that marriage confers on same-sex couples and to become a part of the mainstream that is happening across this country,\" he said. \"I think Oklahoma should be proud of itself.\"\n\nIn their ruling Friday, the judges dealt less with the constitutionality of same-sex marriages and more on arcane legal matters.\n\nHowever, Justice Carlos Lucero reiterated that the court has already found that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry that cannot be breached by the state's concern with keeping the focus of marriage on the procreative potential of man-woman unions.\n\nOklahoma's ban, he wrote, \"denies a fundamental right to all same-sex couples who seek to marry or to have their marriages recognized regardless of their child-rearing ambitions.\"\n\nThe two decisions give increased momentum to a cause that has compiled a string of lower court victories. More than 20 courts have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates since the Supreme Court's DOMA ruling. The rulings have come in 17 states, with Florida being the latest.\n\nTen years ago, nearly a dozen states outlawed gay marriage. Now same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia, and recent polls show a majority of Americans support it.",

thomas jackson tiffany mitchell wesley lowery 38 comments good morning i spent most of the day and night yesterday following the shocking events in ferguson missouri as i read articles and tweets and studied violent images of police dressed as soldiers and riding in military vehicles i had repeated flashbacks to the civil rights era except in those days police werent outfitted with surplus military equipment provided by the federal government back then the cops had to resort to fire hoses to force people off the streets but in ferguson st louis police are equipped with mraps mineresistant ambushprotected vehicles and lrads longrange acoustic devices ferguson isnt a large city and reporters on the ground estimated the size of the crowd at somewhere between 150 and 250 people who were largely protesting peacefully by holding their hands in the air and chanting hands up dont shoot its long past time for missouri governor jay nixon a democrat to step in and tell the cops to calm down and put away their military toys if he wont take action then president obama should instruct attorney general holder to do it the protests follow the killing of 18yearold michael brown by a stillunnamed ferguson policeman last saturday afternoon brown had no criminal background according to kdskcom police claim that brown struggled with the officer and tried to grab his gun but that makes no sense why did the officer choose to stop brown as he peacefully walked down the street with a friend that friend dorian johnson tells a different version of events from usa today witness to michael brown shooting comes forward dorian johnson said he was standing inches from brown when the shooting occurred around 140 pm saturday he gave his account of the shooting to ksdktv the officer is approaching us and as he pulled up on the side of us he didnt say freeze halt or anything like we were committing a crime he said get the f on the sidewalk after johnson said the officer thrust open the door of his patrol car hitting the pair johnson said the officer grabbed brown around the neck and tried to pull him through the window he said brown never tried to reach for the officers weapon the second time he says ill shoot a second later the gun went off and he let go johnson said thats how we were able to run at the same time the first car i see i ducked behind for because i fear for my life im scared i dont know whats going on i dont understand why this officer is shooting his weapon at us according to johnson the officer pursued brown and fired another shot which struck brown in the back he said brown turned and faced the officer with his hands raised my friend started to tell the officer that he was unarmed and that he could stop shooting him johnson said before he could get his second sentence out the officer fired several more shots into his head and chest area he fell dramatically into the fatal position i did not hear once he yell freeze stop or halt it was just horrible to watch unfortunately for the officer who killed brown two more witnesses have now come forward from cnn while michael brown appeared to tussle with an officer before he was shot dead he didnt enter the police cruiser as authorities claim he did two witnesses told cnn the womens accounts corroborate that of a previous witness all three of whom said the officer fatally shot the unarmed teen police have said the black 18yearold died in a dangerous struggle after trying to grab the officers weapon not so say the witnesses it looked as if michael was pushing off and the cop was trying to pull him in tiffany mitchell told cnn on wednesday night mitchell had driven to ferguson to pick up another woman piaget crenshaw the two women witnessed the shooting from two different angles–mitchell from her car and crenshaw from a building nearby neither woman who gave their statements to st louis county police say they saw brown enter the vehicle instead a shot went off then the teen broke free and the officer got out of the vehicle in pursuit the women said i saw the police chase him down the street and shoot him down crenshaw said brown ran about 20 feet michael jerks his body as if hes been hit mitchell said then he faced the officer and put his hands in the air but the officer kept firing both women said he sank to the pavement the protests in ferguson a town in which the population is 23 black but the political leadership and police force are overwhelmingly white are largely driven by the fact that police will not name the shooter or released the results of browns autopsy despite missouris sunshine law august 13 2014 a device deployed by police goes off in the street as police and protesters clash in ferguson mo ap photojeff roberson from the new york times anonymity in missouri police shooting fuels frustration ferguson mo — in the five days since an unarmed young black man was fatally shot by a police officer here the selective release of information about the shooting and especially the anonymity granted to the officer has stoked frustrations in this largely africanamerican community north of st louis where residents describe increasingly tense relations with the police the police chief thomas jackson has repeatedly declined to identify the officer who has been put on administrative leave but on wednesday the chief did offer a new detail about the shooting which has kindled nights of racial unrest and an unyielding police response with tear gas rubber bullets and arrests jackson claims there have been threats against the police officer and he needs protection so why not simply arrest him for murder and send his family to a safer location instead wilson called in law enforcement support from st louis and enabled an incredible overreaction to largely peaceful protests from the times article on wednesday night scores of police officers in riot gear and in armored trucks showed up to disperse protesters who had gathered on the streets near the scene of the shooting some officers perched atop the vehicles with their guns trained on the crowds while protesters chanted hands up dont shoot a police spokesman said that some demonstrators had thrown molotov cocktails at officers and that some had tried to set fires the police used tear gas on demonstrators and some protesters said rubber bullets had been fired at them police said one officer appeared to have suffered a broken ankle after being hit by a brick the police made more than 10 arrests among those arrested was antonio french a st louis alderman who had been documenting the protests on social media his wife said on twitter two reporters covering the protests also said they had been arrested inside a mcdonalds for trespassing and later released without charges or an explanation the reporters wesley lowery of the washington post and ryan j reilly of the huffington post both said they had been handled roughly by

nixon said he would visit the st louis suburbs thursday after police fired tear gas to break up crowds in a fourth night of civil unrest over the police killing of an unarmed black teenager sixteen people were arrested including two reporters on wednesday night in the suburb of ferguson and police said that two officers were injured one hit by a brick nbc affiliate ksdk reported nixon said in a statement that the worsening situation in ferguson was deeply troubling he canceled a planned visit to the state fair while we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public we must also safeguard the rights of missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern he said too little too late imho the baltimore sun riots in ferguson and what they mean by leonard pitts to believe that this carnage — the windows smashed the buildings torched the tear gas wafting — is all about the killing of michael brown is to miss the point because again this is not just about brown its about eric garner choked to death in a confrontation with new york city police its about jordan davis shot to death in jacksonville florida because he played his music too loud its about trayvon martin shot to death in sanford florida because a selfappointed neighborhood guardian judged him a thug its about oscar grant shot by a police officer in an oakland california subway station as cellphone cameras watched its about amadou diallo executed in that vestibule and abner louima sodomized with that broomstick its about rodney king and it is about the bitter sense of siege that lives in africanamerican men a sense that it is perpetually open season on us and that too few people outside of african america really notice much less care people who look like you are every day deprived of health wealth freedom opportunity education the benefit of the doubt the presumption of innocence life itself — and when you try to say this even when you document it with academic studies and buttress it with witness testimony people dont want to hear it people dismiss you deny you lecture you about white victimhood chastise you for playing a socalled race card they choke off avenues of protest prizing silence over justice mistaking silence for peace and never mind that sometimes silence simmers like water in a closed pot on a high flamethe anger we see in ferguson did not spring from nowhere nor arrive fullyformed when michael brown was shot it is the anger of people who are as fannie lou hamer famously said sick and tired of being sick and tired silence imposed on pain can not indefinitely endure people who are hurting will always eventually make themselves heard the only problem with pitts column is that there havent been any actual riots in ferguson yet–unless you count what the police are doing as rioting riverfront times watch police in ferguson arrest tear gas journalists video police

no names of arresting officers the los angeles times says police only released them after their reporter alerted the chief of ferguson police his response oh god who then called st louis county police

headlines associated press reports via ctv sydney australia — investigators looking into the disappearance of the malaysia airlines plane are confident it was on autopilot when it crashed in a remote stretch of the indian ocean australian officials said thursday as they announced the latest shift in the search for the jet after analyzing data exchanged between the plane and a satellite officials believe flight 370 was on autopilot the entire time it was flying across a vast expanse of the southern indian ocean based on the straight path it took australian transport safety bureau chief commissioner martin dolan said certainly for its path across the indian ocean we are confident that the aircraft was operating on autopilot until it ran out of fuel dolan told reporters in canberra the nations capital asked whether the autopilot would have to be manually switched on or whether it could have been activated automatically under a default setting dolan replied the basic assumption would be that if the autopilot is operational its because its been switched on but exactly why the autopilot would have been set on a flight path so far off course from the jets destination of beijing and exactly when it was switched on remains unknown the new york times explains what likely happened a report issued by the australian transport safety bureau outlining how the new search zone had been chosen said that the most likely scenario as the aircraft headed south across the indian ocean on march 8 was that the crew was suffering from hypoxia or was otherwise unresponsive hypoxia occurs when a plane loses air pressure and the pilots lacking adequate oxygen become confused and incapable of performing even basic manual tasks pilots are trained to put on oxygen masks immediately if an aircraft suffers depressurization their masks have an hours air supply compared with only a few minutes for the passengers the plane which left kuala lumpur malaysia bound for beijing with 239 people aboard made its turn south toward the indian ocean about an hour after it stopped responding to airtraffic controllers evidence for an unresponsive crew as the plane flew south includes the loss of radio communications a long period with no maneuvering of the aircraft a steadily maintained cruise altitude and eventual fuel exhaustion and descent the report said given these observations the final stages of the unresponsive crewhypoxia event type appeared to best fit the available evidence for the final period of mh370s flight when it was heading in a generally southerly direction the document said based on the report a new search zone has been designated according to the la times experts from boeing and the us national transportation safety board were among the specialists who helped define the zone based on satellite data and analysis of previous similar incidents the new zone about 1100 miles west of perth australia is farther south than where previous intensive search efforts were carried out this spring after the plane vanished march 8 with 239 people aboard the flight was en route from kuala lumpur to beijing when it went missing australia deputy prime minister warren truss said the search was continuing with a mapping of the ocean floor in the newly defined area to be followed by a comprehensive seafloor search the seafloor search he said should start around august and be completed within one year the area is 58 miles wide and 400 miles long covering an area as big as lake huron the secondlargest of the us great lakes by comparison the area searched with a robotic sonarequipped submarine in may was about 330 square miles first gay marriage license issued in indiana there was exciting news yesterday in the struggle to legalize samesex marriage state by state from npr federal judges reverse gaymarriage bans in utah indiana utah and indiana are the latest states to see their bans on samesex marriage struck down by a federal court following rulings in both states wednesday that found the prohibition unconstitutional in utah the 10th circuit court of appeals panel upheld a lower court ruling striking down the states gaymarriage ban and in indiana us district judge richard young made a similar ruling it is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of samesex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of oppositesex couples the threejudge panel in the utah case said the panel immediately put the ruling on hold pending its appeal either to the entire 10th circuit or directly to the us supreme court according to the associated press in indiana young wrote samesex couples who would otherwise qualify to marry in indiana have the right to marry in indiana these couples when gender and sexual orientation are taken away are in all respects like the family down the street the constitution demands that we treat them as such both decisions are significant in that they may influence decisions in other states carl tobias a law professor at the university of richmond writes npr in an email that the utah decision is very significant as it is the first appellate court to address the marriage equality issue the 4th circuit in virginia may well apply the reasoning of the 10th circuit opinion as will numerous district courts that have yet to rule he says the indiana ruling invalidating its ban today also used similar reasoning tobias says all courts are finding that the bans violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th amendment in another breakthrough republican senator susan collins of maine has announced that she supports samesex marriage from the washington post a number of states including my home state of maine have now legalized samesex marriage and i agree with that decision collins said in a statement adding later i have long opposed efforts to impose a federal ban on samesex marriage in both 2004 and 2006 i voted against amendments to the united states constitution that would have banned samesex marriages by preempting state laws collins joins three other republican senators who publicly support gay marriage lisa

even against one of the cup favorites germany team usa was greeted with cheers from american fans wednesday as they arrived in the brazilian city of recife players spent the three days between matches recovering and regrouping after a physical first game against ghana and an emotional tie against portugal this is the biggest game of a lot of our lives so any fatigue in our legs will be erased said american midfielder kyle beckerman weve got to give everything weve got and more team usa began their world cup run in the socalled group of death but their aggression attacks and overall stamina on the pitch have defied pundits who originally dismissed their chances of advancing i think some people might be a little bit surprised at our results so far coach jurgen klinsmann said wednesday we are by no means any underdog here in this tournament but we know its the biggest hurdle we have to take now with germany klinsman suggested that us fans should take a day off work to watch the game and wrote a letter to bosses asking them to excuse their employees absences reports reuters in the style of a doctors note klinsmann addresses employers and asks them to forgive their staff for their absence the letter was distributed on social networks by the us soccer i understand that this absence may reduce the productivity of your workplace but i can assure you that it is for an important cause wrote klinsmann the usmnt us mens national team has a critical world cup game vs germany and we will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round by the way you

usgermany world cup game in the wake of the us teams heartbreaking comefromahead draw against portugal in the world cup on sunday soccer analysts and twitter users scrambled to figure out the many ways the us can still get to the next round with a threepoint lead over portugal and ghana in group g the americans can advance even if they lose their match against germany at noon eastern today depending on the outcome of the portugalghana game played at the same time deadspin has one of the better graphical breakdown s of every potential scenario for the us including the dreaded drawing of lots all the focus on permutations and goaldifferential scenarios has undercut the importance of todays game for american soccer theres not as much at stake goes the implication because we can move ahead even if we lose to germany but this is about more than getting to the next round this is an opportunity for the us to face one of soccers elite teams on the biggest stage and prove it can hang with—even beat—any country in this world cup before the tournament most people thought it would be an unlikely success for the us just to get out of the socalled group of death and to the round of 16 now after beating ghana and dominating much of the game against portugal the us can dream bigger beat germany and america wins its group for the second straight world cup a result nearly unthinkable when the draw was announced in december beat germany and the us secures a favorable round of 16 match most likely against algeria or russia rather than a trickier faceoff with sneakygood belgium just as important a win would mean that the americans have defeated one of soccers oligarchs at a world cup with both sides trying their best for a victory that by itself would be a precedentsetting result people in oklahoma are beginning to ask questions about why their state has been having so many earthquakes all of a sudden according to the globegazzettecom barbara brown poses for a photo on the front step of her home that now sits about one foot off the surface of her lawn saturday june 21 2014 in reno texas oklahoma city ap — oklahoma residents whose homes and nerves have been shaken by an upsurge in earthquakes want to know whats causing the temblors — and what can be done to stop them hundreds of people are expected to turn out in edmond oklahoma on thursday night for a town hall meeting on the issue earthquakes used to be almost unheard of on the vast stretches of prairie that unfold across texas kansas and oklahoma but theyve become common in recent years oklahoma recorded nearly 150 between january and the start of may though most have been too weak to cause serious damage or endanger lives theyve raised suspicions that the shaking might be connected to the oil and gas drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing especially the wells in which the industry disposes of its wastewater now after years of being harangued by anxious residents governments in all three states are confronting the issue reviewing scientific data holding public discussions and considering new regulations thursdays meeting in oklahoma will include the state agency that regulates oil and

than molecules and have the potency to bind to sand grains with the wastewater colloids get released in to the ground water this study was published in the journal of the american chemical society and

had been in the job only since september 2011 but people in the company briefed on the situation described serious tension in her relationship with mr sulzberger who was concerned about complaints from employees that she was polarizing and mercurial she had also had clashes with mr baquet in recent weeks these people said mr baquet had become angered over a decision by ms abramson to make a job offer to a senior editor from the guardian janine gibson and install her alongside him in a comanaging editor position without consulting him it escalated the conflict between them and rose to the attention of mr sulzberger ms abramson did not attend the afternoon meeting at which her dismissal was announced the times won eight pulitzer prizes under ms abramson and she won praise for journalistic efforts both in print and on the web she had previously served as the head of the washington bureau and before coming to the times was an investigative reporter at the wall street journal she cowrote with ms jane mayer of the new yorker strange justice a book about the confirmation hearings for the supreme court justice clarence thomas but as a leader of the newsroom she was accused by some of divisiveness and criticized for several of her personnel choices in particular the appointment of several major department heads who did not last long in their jobs with mr sulzberger more closely monitoring her stewardship tensions between ms abramson and mr baquet escalated in one publicized incident he angrily slammed his hand against a wall in the newsroom he had been under consideration for the lead job when ms abramson was selected and according to people familiar with his thinking he was growing frustrated working with her lets see abramson was polarizing and mercurial was accused by some of divisiveness and her male second in command didnt like taking orders from her have i got that right is it just me or do those sound like code words now lets see what people who dont work for sulzberger are saying from ken auletta at the new yorker why jill abramson was fired at the annual city university journalism school dinner on monday dean baquet the managing editor of the new york times was seated with arthur sulzberger jr the papers publisher at the time i did not give a moments thought to why jill abramson the papers executive editor was not at their table then at 236 pm on wednesday an announcement from the times hit my email saying that baquet would replace abramson less than three years after she was appointed the first woman in the top job baquet will be the first africanamerican to lead the times fellowjournalists and others scrambled to find out what had happened sulzberger had fired abramson and he did not try to hide that in a speech to the newsroom on wednesday afternoon he said i chose to appoint a new leader of our newsroom because i believe that new leadership will improve some aspects abramson chose not to attend the announcement and not to pretend that she had volunteered to step down apparently the real problem sultzberg had with abramson was that she was an uppity woman as with any such upheaval theres a history behind it several weeks ago im told abramson discovered that her pay and her pension benefits as both executive editor and before that as managing editor were considerably less than the pay and pension benefits of bill keller the male editor whom she replaced in both jobs she confronted the top brass one close associate said and this may have fed into the managements narrative that she was pushy a characterization that for many has an inescapably gendered aspect sulzberger is known to believe that the times as a financially beleaguered newspaper needed to retreat on some of its generous pay and pension benefits abramson who spent much of her career at the wall street journal had been at the times for far fewer years than keller which accounted for some of the pension disparity eileen murphy a spokeswoman for the times said that jill abramsons total compensation as executive editor was directly comparable to bill kellers—though it was not actually the same i was also told by another friend of abramsons that the pay gap with keller was only closed after she complained but to women at an institution that was once sued by its female employees for discriminatory practices the question brings up ugly memories whether abramson was right or wrong both sides were left unhappy a third associate told me she found out that a former deputy managing editor—a man—made more money than she did while she was managing editor she had a lawyer make polite inquiries about the pay and pension disparities which set them off the other issues auletta mentions are similar to those described in the nyt article she had problems with baquet and those who worked under her sometimes complained she was brusque as opposed to mr personality bill keller again it sounds to me as if abrahams biggest problem was her gender mr baquet sounds pretty pushy too but for him that was acceptable i guess josh marshall at tpm points out that the times article notes in passing that abramson reached a settlement with the times which makes pretty clear that whatever might have happened with disparate pay or a connection between her pressing the matter and her firing there will not be a lawsuit hmmm sounds like sultzberger thought abramson might have grounds to sue if he didnt settle with her at business insider hunter walker calls attention to the times past problems with gender disparities in pay also mentioned by ken auletta in the new yorker piece linked above auletta claimed other times staffers were concerned about the pay disparity between abramson and keller he said it brought up ugly memories of a 1974 lawsuit female employees made against the paper due to allegations of sex discrimination in hiring pay and promotion on twitter npr media correspondent david folkenflik subsequently confirmed aulettas report folkenflik also noted unspecified figures at times wonder what role gender ultimately played in abramsons ouster finally politico describes how the announcement impacted other new york times employees invitation to a beheaading how times editors learned of abramsons ouster please come to a mastheaddept head meeting at 200 pm today in the page one conference room3rd floor that was the note top editors at the new york times received this afternoon summoning them to an abrupt gathering in which publisher and times company chairman arthur sulzberger jr would inform them that executive editor jill abramson was being replaced in the no 1 masthead spot by one of her deputies managing editor dean baquet the newscame as a shock to most of the assembled editors there had been none of the drama or widespread discontent that led up to the famous firing of howell raines in 2003 in fact when they arrived in the room their first inkling of what was about to transpire was the fact that abramson was not present sulzberger gave the same vague reasoning for the change that would be relayed in a company memo and at a full newsroom meeting shortly thereafter—that the decision had to do with abramsons newsroom management not everyone was buying it when sulzberger said he was sure it doesnt come as a surprise to you video editor bruce headlam spoke up in abramsons defense according to a person who was present it does come as a surprise to me the source recalls him saying two other editors also voiced their concerns sources with knowledge of the meeting told capital national editor alison mitchell suggested that abramsons firing wouldnt sit well with a broad swath of female times journalists who saw her as a role model abramson became the times first female executive editor in 2011 after bill keller stepped down assistant managing editor susan chira seconded that notion read more at the link so draw your own

cowboys and indians ride into us capital to protest keystone pipeline for a few days teepees erected by native americans and their cowboy allies will frame the view of the washington monument from the national mall charles relyea 20s 30s a group of roughly 60 ranchers farmers tribal leaders and members whose land falls near or on the proposed pathway of the contested keystone xl pipeline calling themselves the cowboyindian alliance rode into the nations capital on horseback tuesday to set up camp and begin four days of demonstration to register their protest of the project the yettobeapproved 1179mile pipeline which would carry crude oil from the tar sands of canadas alberta province to gulf coast refineries in texas has been mired in controversy legal challenges and delays for five years critics many of them environmentalists say that the keystone xl will only deepen the united states dependence on fossil fuels hasten the effects of climate change although that contention is disputed and violate landowners rights proponents on the other hand say its construction will boost the economy lead to the creation of american jobs and move the country towards energy independence many see the issue as the defining test of president barack obamas commitment to the environment as a candidate in 2007 he vowed to end the tyranny of oil the ranchers and native americans — about 40 of whom led a procession on horseback before coming to the national mall to set up a camp of teepees — said they wanted to ensure lawmakers and the obama administration were hearing them loud and clear about their qualms matthew black eagle man a 45yearold member of the sioux long plain first nation tribe in manitoba canada said the government attempting to build a pipeline on native american lands continues a longstanding pattern of abuse inflicted on indigenous people for 500 years our people have been suffering he said the government gave us the most desolate places in the country for our reservations now they want to build a pipeline on our land black eagle man said too that native americans were committed to being good stewards of the earths resources were here to help protect the water our first medicine he said our most abundant resource is being destroyed by man hopi woman as for the cowboys i raise horses on a small ranch and they cant drink oil sooner or later that things going to leak said mike blocker 62 whose ranch is in antelope county in nebraska directly in the path of the pipeline how can you sleep at night knowing that 830000 pounds of this crap is flowing underground where you live donna roller 62 who owns a farm in york county neb was appalled that more of the public was not up in arms that a foreign oil company — transcanada the owner of the pipeline — was marching into the united states and trampling on american land rights what the hell what is wrong with the american public that they are complacent in this she said this is a foreign corporation thats going to make billions off our backs we wont allow them to go — we will lay our bodies on the line with the native americans we need water we need food she added we dont need tar sands the cowboy and indian alliance has four days of events planned including documentary screenings meetings with environmental groups and elected leaders traditional native american ceremonies and delivering a teepee painted by the activists to the museum of the american indian in honor of obama as a sign of respect the week will culminate in a rally on saturday that organizers are expecting to attract

the news yesterday from scotus that effectively puts those 50th anniversary civil rights act celebrations earlier in the month to shame court backs michigan on affirmative action in a fractured decision that revealed deep divisions over what role the judiciary should play in protecting racial and ethnic minorities the supreme court on tuesday upheld a michigan constitutional amendment that bans affirmative action in admissions to the states public universities the 6to2 ruling effectively endorsed similar measures in seven other states it may also encourage more states to enact measures banning the use of race in admissions or to consider raceneutral alternatives to ensure diversity states that forbid affirmative action in higher education like florida and california as well as michigan have seen a significant drop in the enrollment of black and hispanic students in their most selective colleges and universities in five separate opinions spanning more than 100 pages the justices set out starkly conflicting views the justices in the majority with varying degrees of vehemence said that policies affecting minorities that do not involve intentional discrimination should be decided at the ballot box rather than in the courtroom i know that dakinikat quoted the justices yesterday in the comments but i wanted front page this real quick but justice sonia sotomayor in the longest most passionate and most significant dissent of her career said the constitution required special vigilance in light of the history of slavery jim crow and recent examples of discriminatory changes to state voting laws little apache girl her opinion longer than the four other opinions combined appeared to reflect her own experiences with affirmative action at princeton and yale law school i had been admitted to the ivy league through a special door she wrote in her bestselling memoir my beloved world for years she wrote i lived the daytoday reality of affirmative action signaling deep displeasure justice sotomayor summarized her dissent from the bench an unusual move that happens perhaps three times a term she said the initiative put minorities to a burden not faced by other college applicants athletes children of alumni and students from underrepresented parts of the state she said remained free to try to persuade university officials to give their applications special weight the one and only policy a michigan citizen may not seek through this longestablished process she wrote is a racesensitive admissions policy that difference she said violates the constitutions equal protection clause the constitution does not protect racial minorities from political defeat she wrote but neither does it give the majority free rein to erect selective barriers against racial minorities justice ruth bader ginsburg joined the dissent justice sotomayor seemed to mock one of chief justice robertss most memorable lines in a 2007 decision that limited the use of race to achieve integration in public school systems he wrote the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race justice sotomayor recast the line the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race she wrote is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race and to apply the constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination that is a great way to introduce this little tidbit of news from a disturbing easter egg incident in virginia with snark of course some white supremacists planted easter eggs

the new mexico city said the shooting occurred monday morning during a chase an officer pursued on foot when the suspect stopped turned and pointed a handgun at close range eden said police identified

link to an interactive article from the ny times from back in january mapping poverty in america – the new york times seems fitting to review it again and it goes hand in hand with this from the daily banter medicaid expansion will cost states even less than expected bobcescacom from the center on budget and policy priorities cbo now estimates that the federal government will on average pick up more than 95 percent of the total cost of the medicaid expansion and other health reformrelated costs in medicaid and the childrens health insurance program chip over the next ten years 20152024 states will spend only 16 percent more on medicaid and chip due to health reform than they would have spent without health reform thats about onethird less than cbo projected in february and the 16 percent figure is before counting the state savings that the medicaid expansion will produce in state expenditures for services such as mental health and substance abuse treatment provided to the uninsured the federal government will cover 100 percent of the cost of expanding medicaid until 2017 and while it was projected that the government would cover 90 percent of the cost beyond that time period the congressional budget office cbo now projects that the federal government will cover more than 95 percent until at least 2024 expanding medicaid was already a pretty good deal for states given that the federal government will cover the entire cost for several years and the overwhelming majority of costs thereafter but the deal just got sweeter but that doesnt mean shit to the assholes who run the states like mine finally not all things that quack like a duckturn out to be a duck for the last 50 years there has been these strange quacking sounds heard from the southern ocean that has kept people wonderingwhat the hell is it mystery of ocean quack sound solved the mystery of a bizarre quacking sound heard in the ocean has finally been solved scientists report the noise – nicknamed the bioduck – appears in the winter and spring in the southern ocean however its source has baffled researchers for decades now acoustic recorders have revealed that the sound is in fact the underwater chatter of the antarctic minke whale the findings are published in the royal society journal biology letters lead researcher denise risch from the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa northeast fisheries science center in massachusetts said it was hard to find the source of the signal over the years there have been several suggestions but noone was able to really show this species was producing the sound until now the rest of this story sounds like something out of the incredible mr limpet 1964 the strange sound was first detected by submarines about 50 years ago those who heard it were surprised by its quacklike qualities since then the repetitive low frequency noise has been recorded many times in the waters around the antarctic and western australia suggestions for its source have ranged from fish to ships the researchers now say they have conclusive evidence that the bioduck is produced by the antarctic minke whale in 2013 acoustic recorders were attached to two of the marine mammals and recorded the whales making the strange noise dr risch said it was either the animal carrying the tag or a closeby animal of the same species producing the sound they still need to do analysis on the tapes to see when or why the whales make the sounds but at least the scientist are sure the minke are the ones making the noise this is not the only acoustic puzzle that scientists have recently shed light on another baffling low frequency noise – called the bloop – turned out to be the sound of antarcticas ice cracking and there you are

of kitty genovese in queens new york this was a crime that shocked and outraged america and the world and still horrifies and fascinates people to this day at the new yorker nicholas lehmann describes some of the reasons this news story has become so iconic and reviews two new books on the case lehmann argues that new york times editor abe rosenthal created a news environment in which this particular murder became the focus of so much attention lehmann deliberately shaped the coverage of the murder in a sensational and misleading manner the story ended up as the focus of a classic psychological study a post about this in august 2009 and i thought id put that post up again today i wrote a piece about this in august 2009 i thought id repost it today ive made a few minor edits to the original at the end i list some recent books and articles for further reading the kitty genovese case a fascinating intersection of true crime psychology and media misinformation a murder in kew gardens on march 13 1964 at around 330am there was a murder in the kew gardens section of queens new york the murder probably wouldnt have gotten much publicity at all if it hadnt been for a sensational article that appeared on the front page of the new york times a couple of weeks later the times story led to groundbreaking research in social psychology and the discovery of new and counterintuitive information about human behavior it was very late very cold and very dark when 28yearold catherine kitty genovese parked her car at the kew gardens train station after driving from evs eleventh hour bar in hollis where she worked nights as manager when she got out of her car she saw a stranger walking toward her the man winston mosley 29 stabbed genovese two times as she hurried past a bookstore on austin street pehaps headed a local bar named baileys to seek assistance she called out oh my god he stabbed me please help me and fell to the ground winston was leaning over her to stab her again when he heard a mans voice calling from a window in an apartment building across the street leave that girl alone winston mosley startled mosley ran down an alley got into his car and backed up ready to drive off lights had gone on in the nearby apartment building but they went off again mosley got out of the car and again followed genovese who had reached the doorway of her apartment building which was in the back of the building at 8262 austin street as she fell forward through the doorway crying out im dying im dying winston caught up with her stabbed her again and then raped her a short time later a neighbor greta schwartz who had called the police after receiving a phone call from another neighbor ran down to the lobby and cradled kitty in her lap until the paramedics arrived from interviews in the neighborhoods of the two stabbing incidents police learned that as many as 37 people had seen or heard part of the stalking and murder of kitty genovese by winston mosley but supposedly none of them had called the police except greta schwartz the new york times breaks the story on march 27 1964 the new york times published a front page story by martin gansberg warning pdf headlined 37 who saw murder didnt call police apathy at stabbing of queens woman shocks inspector for more than half an hour 38 respectable lawabiding citizens in queens watched a killer stalk and stab a woman in three separate attacks in kew gardens twice the sound of their voices and the sudden glow of their bedroom lights interrupted him and frightened him off each time he returned sought her out and stabbed her again not one person telephoned the police during the assault one witness called after the woman was dead that was two weeks ago today but assistant chief inspector frederick m lussen in charge of the boroughs detectives and a veteran of 25 years of homicide investigations is still shocked he can give a matteroffact recitation of many murders but the kew gardens slaying baffles him–not because it is a murder but because the good people failed to call the police just that brief excerpt contains a number of inaccuracies which ill get to a little later nevertheless it was from this newspaper article that americans–and people around the world–formed their lasting impressions of the tragic death of kitty genovese the story shocked the nation everyone was talking about how terrible it was that in big cities like new york people just didnt seem to get to know their neighbors or care about them those of us who lived in small cities and towns were sure things would be different in our neighborhoods psychological study of the bystander effect in 1968 jm darley and b latane published a study pdf in the journal of personality and social psychology that was inspired by the supposed behavior of the 37 witnesses to kitty genoveses murder they hypothesized that the reason bystanders did not take action was diffusion of responsibility and that the more bystanders in an emergency situation the more these bystanders believe that someone else will help so i dont need to participants in the study were college students in an introductory psychology class at new york university darley and latane told participants that they wanted to study how students adjust to university life in a highly competitive urban environment they said they wanted participants to discuss their problems honestly with other students and in order to avoid personal discomfort participants would sit in separate rooms equipped with an intercom system there were three different groups students in group one were told they would be talking with one other person in group two students were told there would be two other people on the intercome with them group five was told there would be five other people listening in to the conversation in reality all of the students were alone and they the other voices they heard were on tape the emergency was that one of the participants in the discussion has epileptic seizure the sounds of the seizure were actually played on tape as the intercom discussions began students heard the first student a male tell about his difficulties concentrating on his studies and problems adjusting to life in new york city he then added with some embarrassment that he sometimes had severe seizures especially when under a lot of stress then the conversation switched to the next student in group 1 the actual students turn came next in the other two groups the real student heard one or more other students speak first after the real student took a turn speaking the first student again started to speak normally then began having a seizure and asked for help darley and latane measured how long it took subjects to help the student in trouble helping was defined as leaving the cubicle and notifying an experimenter of the problem why not because they were apathetic all subjects were anxious and showed physical signs of nervousness darley and latane conclued that as the number of people involved in an emergency situation increase its easier for bystanders to assume that someone else will handle it and the potential guilt for not helping is divided up other possible reasons for failure to act are fear of embarrassment or ridicule fear that they are misinterpreting the situation the authors also pointed out that most people dont have much experience with emergency situations and are likely to become confused or overwhelmed when they encounter one joseph de may jr and the kew gardens history page in 2000 joseph de may who had lived in kew gardens since 1974 decided to build a website that would contain a comprehensive pictorial history of the neighborhood as part of his project de may dug up as much information as he could about the kitty genovese murder and then critiqued the original new york times article and debunked some myths that had grown up around the case here is the short version of his critique there were only 2 attacks not 3 the attacks were not continuous there was about a 10 min interval between them when the killer moved his car to a parking place farther away there were not 38 eye witnesses to either of the attacks only 3 people are known to have seen one or the other of the stabbings the first attack on austin street – the one that awakened the witnesses – was likely over before all but a few of the witnesses got to their windows probably many more than 38 were ear witnesses to kittys screams however that first attack occurred a few yards away from a bar known for its late night rowdiness after the first attack kitty left the scene under her own power without making any outcries for help the second attack took place in a small vestibule in the rear of a building where only one witness was in a position to see it given the layout of the crime scene it would have been impossible for anyone to have seen or heard everything assuming the police were not timely called – a big assumption in my opinion – there were reasons apart from apathy why they were not crime scene photo back of apartment building where kitty died furthermore a 15yearold boy named michael hoffman saw winston mosley run away after the first attack in front of the bookstore and saw kitty genovese get up and stagger in the other direction he didnt know there had been a stabbing but he told his father what he had seen and the father called the police the police later admitted they had received several other calls one man did see the knife and understood that a woman was being stabbed this man never called the police and couldnt explain his inaction at least five other people saw mosley return to the original scene but by that time kitty genovese was gone there were two attacks not three as the new york times reported a man on the first floor of kittys building open his door and saw the final attack he wanted to call police but said his wife didnt want him to get involved he went to greta schwartzs apartment and asked her to call police which she did she then ran downstairs with a friend found kitty still alive and cradled her until an ambulance arrived also contrary to the new york times story the occupants of kitty genoveses apartments building knew and were friendly with each other many knew and liked kitty and her roomate mary ann zielonko the real kitty genovese in 2004 on the fortieth anniversary of kitty genoveses death mary ann zielonko came forward and talked about kitty publicly for the first time she was interviewed on nprs weekend edition saturday in the interview zielonko who now lives in vermont revealed that she and kitty genovese were lovers a lesbian blogger in vermont wrote a piece about her own feelings after she learned about kittys sexual orientation hearing that genovese was a lesbian has shaken up my psyche genoveses name was always a cautionary tale – about being a woman alone in the city at night about the need to care and take action in the face of assault but now its also somehow more about me as a lesbian about our denied and undiscovered herstory about the dangers we faced then – and now in 1964 it was not okay to be queer the only place to go to hold your lovers hand in semipublic was a bar mary ann remembers the swing rendezvous on macdougal st and the seven steps on houston police raids and being beaten up for wearing butch or femme drag were common events until now weve never had the opportunity to ask whether the neighbors indifference might have had an element of homophobia not that the word existed then kitty and mary ann lived together in the apartment kitty was so desperately trying to reach that march night mary ann says some of the neighbors suspected they were lesbians because they were always together but we didnt look gay whatever that means mary ann got home from her own shift tending bar and went to sleep – until the police knocked at her door at 4 am and drove her from the treelined streets of their kew gardens queens neighborhood where kitty died to the hospital morgue to identify kittys body some of the neighbors may have suspected that kitty and mary ann were gay but several reported in interviews that she was a friendly smiling young woman whom they liked a few told police and reporters that they didnt want to get involved but most werent sure what they had seen or heard and couldnt say why they didnt call for help it was after 3am on a winter night in a neighborhood where there were often loud voices and even fighting among people leaving local bars as with the participants in darley and latanes study some of the witnesses may have feared giving a false report to police and looking foolish in addition joseph de may reports that in those days nyc police demanded that callers identify themselves rather than just accepting reports of emergencies that may have deterred some from calling police or holding on long enough to get someone to listen even if witnesses had called police to report screaming or fighting they would likely have taken a long time to respond because of the bars in the area in 2004 the new york times interviewed de may about his research in the end mr de mays conclusion about the murder is that while the behavior of the witnesses was hardly beyond reproach the common conception of exactly what occurred that night is not in fact what occurred what did occur he argues is far more complex and far less damning to the residents of kew gardens yeah there was a murder mr de may said yeah people heard something you can question how a few people behaved but this wasnt 38 people watching a woman be slaughtered for 35 minutes and saying oh i dont want to be involved mr de may began his research with the seminal times article of march 27 1964 i remember reading through it then putting it down and thinking well this doesnt hang together at all he said and then i read it again carefully i knew the area i knew the crime scene because i go by there every day mr de may soon found himself poring through legal documents related to the case scouring books and articles and interviewing neighbors at one point he even ran the route of ms genoveses flight up austin street timing it with a watch he became convinced that his first impression was correct heres something that everyone thinks happened he said that isnt so winston mosley kittys murderer had no idea that she was a lesbian he had set out that night to kill a woman he was certainly a sociopath and may have been a serial killer he confessed to having killed at least one other woman after he was arrested for the genovese murder in 1968 mosley managed to escape from police custody and raped a pregnant woman in her home in april 2008 the new york

            "text": "I’ll have to end there, because this post is getting way too long. I’ll post more important links in the comments. I’ll leave it to you Sky Dancers to update me on the rest of the news. I’ve been too focuses on Ferguson to pay attention to anything else. See you in the comment thread.\n\nAmid clashes in the St. Louis suburb Wednesday night, the senator tweeted that she’s been working the phones to try to deescalate the “tense and unacceptable situation.” ….\n\nSen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) says she has a phone call planned with Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday to discuss the situation in Ferguson, Mo., where an apparently unarmed black teenager was fatally shot by a police officer last weekend.\n\nMissouri Senator Claire McCaskill decided last night that it was time for her to take some action, since Governor Nixon wasn’t doing it. She will meet with Eric Holder today to discuss the Ferguson situation.\n\nLate last night, police in Ferguson also tried to order the media to shut off their cameras, and they attacked journalists from Al Jazeera and confiscated their equipment.\n\nThe journalists say they were arrested without being read their Miranda writes and eventually released with nothing — no charges, no police report, no names of arresting officers. The Los Angeles Times says police only released them after their reporter alerted the chief of Ferguson Police (His response: “Oh, god,”), who then called St. Louis County Police.\n\nSWAT officers arrested Wesley Lowery, a political reporter at TheWashington Post, and Ryan Reilly, a Huffington Post justice reporter, shortly before 7 p.m. while clearing out a McDonalds near the protests where they were working. The reporters say police asked for their identification and eventually arrested them when they weren’t leaving quickly enough.\n\nPolice actions against press seem to be part of the reason Governor Jay Nixon finally decided to cut his Missouri State Fair trip short. The governor says he’ll arrive in St. Louis County Thursday morning to manage what’s increasingly becoming a volatile, violent and devastating time in St. Louis history.\n\nThe only problem with Pitts’ column is that there haven’t been any actual “riots” in Ferguson yet–unless you count what the police are doing as rioting.\n\nThey choke off avenues of protest, prizing silence over justice, mistaking silence for peace. And never mind that sometimes, silence simmers like water in a closed pot on a high flame….the anger we see in Ferguson did not spring from nowhere, nor arrive, fully-formed, when Michael Brown was shot. It is the anger of people who are, as Fannie Lou Hamer famously said, sick and tired of being sick and tired.\n\nAnd that too few people outside of African America really notice, much less care. People who look like you are every day deprived of health, wealth, freedom, opportunity, education, the benefit of the doubt, the presumption of innocence, life itself — and when you try to say this, even when you document it with academic studies and buttress it with witness testimony, people don’t want to hear it, people dismiss you, deny you, lecture you about white victimhood, chastise you for playing a so-called “race card.”\n\nAnd it is about the bitter sense of siege that lives in African-American men, a sense that it is perpetually open season on us.\n\nBecause, again, this is not just about Brown. It’s about Eric Garner, choked to death in a confrontation with  New York City Police. It’s about Jordan Davis, shot to death in  Jacksonville , Florida, because he played his music too loud. It’s about  Trayvon Martin , shot to death in Sanford, Florida, because a self-appointed neighborhood guardian judged him a thug. It’s about Oscar Grant, shot by a police officer in an Oakland, California, subway station as cellphone cameras watched. It’s about Amadou Diallo, executed in that vestibule and Abner Louima, sodomized with that broomstick. It’s about Rodney King.\n\nTo believe that this carnage — the windows smashed, the buildings torched, the tear gas wafting — is all about the killing of Michael Brown is to miss the point….\n\nNixon said in a statement that the worsening situation in Ferguson was “deeply troubling.” He canceled a planned visit to the state fair. “While we all respect the solemn responsibility of our law enforcement officers to protect the public, we must also safeguard the rights of Missourians to peaceably assemble and the rights of the press to report on matters of public concern,” he said.\n\nSixteen people were arrested, including two reporters, on Wednesday night in the suburb of Ferguson, and police said that two officers were injured, one hit by a brick, NBC affiliate KSDK reported ….\n\nMissouri Gov. Jay Nixon said he would visit the St. Louis suburbs Thursday after police fired tear gas to break up crowds in a fourth night of civil unrest over the police killing of an unarmed black teenager.\n\nOne of the photo comparisons below. Which was taken in Ferguson and which in Iraq?\n\nThe photos below show the heavily armed Ferguson police officers, dressed in camouflaged uniforms. They are set side-by-side with images of U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAs America scaled back its presence in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2012, military gear — amphibious tanks, weapons, uniforms and drones — spilled into local police arsenals . In June, an ACLU report warned of the “excessive militarization” of local law enforcement. “This has the effect of terrifying people, destroying communities and actually undermining public safety,” Kara Dansky, ACLU senior counsel, told Mashable in June.\n\nIf you don’t read anything else on the events in Ferguson, read this article and look at the photos.\n\nTwo reporters covering the protests also said they had been arrested inside a McDonald’s for trespassing and later released without charges or an explanation. The reporters, Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post and Ryan J. Reilly of The Huffington Post, both said they had been handled roughly by the police.\n\nThe police made more than 10 arrests. Among those arrested was Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman, who had been documenting the protests on social media, his wife said on Twitter.\n\nOn Wednesday night, scores of police officers in riot gear and in armored trucks showed up to disperse protesters who had gathered on the streets near the scene of the shooting. Some officers perched atop the vehicles with their guns trained on the crowds while protesters chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot.” A police spokesman said that some demonstrators had thrown Molotov cocktails at officers and that some had tried to set fires. The police used tear gas on demonstrators, and some protesters said rubber bullets had been fired at them. Police said one officer appeared to have suffered a broken ankle after being hit by a brick.\n\nJackson claims there have been threats against the police officer and he needs protection. So why not simply arrest him for murder and send his family to a safer location? Instead, Wilson called in law enforcement support from St. Louis and enabled an incredible overreaction to largely peaceful protests. From the Times article:\n\nThe police chief, Thomas Jackson, has repeatedly declined to identify the officer, who has been put on administrative leave. But on Wednesday, the chief did offer a new detail about the shooting, which has kindled nights of racial unrest and an unyielding police response with tear gas, rubber bullets and arrests.\n\nFERGUSON, Mo. — In the five days since an unarmed young black man was fatally shot by a police officer here, the selective release of information about the shooting, and especially the anonymity granted to the officer, has stoked frustrations in this largely African-American community north of St. Louis, where residents describe increasingly tense relations with the police.\n\nThe protests in Ferguson, a town in which the population is 2/3 black but the political leadership and police force are overwhelmingly white, are largely driven by the fact that police will not name the shooter or released the results of Brown’s autopsy, despite Missouri’s sunshine law .\n\nThen he faced the officer and put his hands in the air, but the officer kept firing, both women said. He sank to the pavement.\n\n“I saw the police chase him … down the street and shoot him down,” Crenshaw said. Brown ran about 20 feet.\n\nInstead, a shot went off, then the teen broke free, and the officer got out of the vehicle in pursuit, the women said.\n\nNeither woman, who gave their statements to St. Louis County police, say they saw Brown enter the vehicle.\n\nMitchell had driven to Ferguson to pick up another woman Piaget Crenshaw. The two women witnessed the shooting from two different angles–Mitchell from her car and Crenshaw from a building nearby.\n\n“It looked as if Michael was pushing off and the cop was trying to pull him in,” Tiffany Mitchell told CNN on Wednesday night.\n\nPolice have said the black 18-year-old died in a dangerous struggle after trying to grab the officer’s weapon. Not so, say the witnesses.\n\nThe women’s accounts corroborate that of a previous witness, all three of whom said the officer fatally shot the unarmed teen.\n\nWhile Michael Brown appeared to tussle with an officer before he was shot dead, he didn’t enter the police cruiser as authorities claim he did, two witnesses told CNN.\n\nUnfortunately for the officer who killed Brown, two more witnesses have now come forward . From CNN:\n\n“My friend started to tell the officer that he was unarmed and that he could stop shooting (him),” Johnson said. “Before he could get his second sentence out, the officer fired several more shots into his head and chest area. He fell dramatically into the fatal position. I did not hear once he yell freeze, stop or halt. it was just horrible to watch.”\n\nAccording to Johnson, the officer pursued Brown and fired another shot. which struck Brown in the back. He said Brown turned and faced the officer with his hands raised.\n\n“The second time he says, ‘I’ll shoot,’ a second later the gun went off and he let go,” Johnson said. “That’s how we were able to run at the same time. The first car I see, I ducked behind for because I fear for my life. I’m scared. I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t understand why this officer is shooting his weapon at us.”\n\nAfter Johnson said the officer thrust open the door of his patrol car, hitting the pair, Johnson said the officer grabbed Brown around the neck and tried to pull him through the window. He said Brown never tried to reach for the officer’s weapon.\n\n“The officer is approaching us and as he pulled up on the side of us, he didn’t say freeze, halt or anything like we were committing a crime. He said, ‘Get the F on the sidewalk.’\n\nDorian Johnson said he was standing inches from Brown when the shooting occurred around 1:40 p.m. Saturday. He gave his account of the shooting to KSDK-TV.\n\nThe protests follow the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a still-unnamed Ferguson policeman last Saturday afternoon. Brown “had no criminal background,” according to KDSK.com.  Police claim that Brown struggled with the officer and tried to grab his gun. But that makes no sense. Why did the officer choose to stop Brown as he peacefully walked down the street with a friend? That friend, Dorian Johnson tells a different version of events.\n\nFerguson isn’t a large city, and reporters on the ground estimated the size of the “crowd” at somewhere between 150 and 250 people, who were largely protesting peacefully by holding their hands in the air and chanting “Hands up. Don’t shoot.” It’s long past time for Missouri Governor Jay Nixon (a Democrat) to step in and tell the cops to calm down and put away their military toys. If he won’t take action, then President Obama should instruct Attorney General Holder to do it.\n\nI spent most of the day and night yesterday following the shocking events in Ferguson, Missouri. As I read articles and tweets and studied violent images of police dressed as soldiers and riding in military vehicles, I had repeated flashbacks to the Civil Rights era. Except in those days, police weren’t outfitted with surplus military equipment provided by the Federal government. Back then, the cops had to resort to fire hoses to force people off the streets; but in Ferguson, St. Louis police are equipped with MRAPs (mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles)  and LRADs (long-range acoustic devices) .\n\nNow . . . what stories are you following today? Are you going to watch the U.S.-Germany game? Please post your thoughts and links in the comment thread.\n\nSo if you bought into the “cave man diet” AKA “Paleolithic diet” recommendations, you were scammed. These early Neanderthals even cooked vegetables and may have used plants for medicinal purposes. Read the whole article at the link. It’s fascinating.\n\nMs Sistiaga and her colleagues collected a number of samples from the remnants of a 50,000-year-old campfire in the El Salt dig site, a known Neanderthal habitation near Alicante on Spain’s Mediterranean coast.\n\nPoo is “the perfect evidence,” said Ms Ainara Sistiaga, a PhD student at the University of La Laguna on the Canary Islands, and the study’s first author, “because you’re sure it was consumed”.\n\nThe new paper, in the journal  PLOS One , claims to offer the best support to date for an omnivorous diet.\n\nAn earlier view of these early humans as purely meat-eating has already been partially discredited by plant remains found in their caves and teeth.\n\nThis study was done to determine the remaining colloids amounts in groundwater when the above soil got exposed to flowback fliud in a hydrofracking spills.\n\nThis study was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society and was conducted by the researchers at the Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.\n\nIn this study, flowback fluid from hydraulic fracturing was analyzed. Colloids are the charged particles and larger than molecules and have the potency to bind to sand grains. With the wastewater, colloids get released in to the ground water.\n\nAccording to a new research, wastewater contains substances that bind to pollutants and their release in soil leads to the ground water contamination as they get along with the water when it is soaked by earth.\n\nGee, do you suppose it could have anything to do with fracking? And what about all that wastewater that has to be disposed of in the fracking process? From Techsonia:  Fracking Fluid Spills release Colloids that Pollute Groundwater .\n\nNow after years of being harangued by anxious residents, governments in all three states are confronting the issue, reviewing scientific data, holding public discussions and considering new regulations. Thursday’s meeting in Oklahoma will include the state agency that regulates oil and gas drilling and the Oklahoma Geological Survey.\n\nOklahoma recorded nearly 150 between January and the start of May. Though most have been too weak to cause serious damage or endanger lives, they’ve raised suspicions that the shaking might be connected to the oil and gas drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing, especially the wells in which the industry disposes of its wastewater.\n\nEarthquakes used to be almost unheard of on the vast stretches of prairie that unfold across Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma, but they’ve become common in recent years.\n\nHundreds of people are expected to turn out in Edmond, Oklahoma, on Thursday night for a town hall meeting on the issue.\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Oklahoma residents whose homes and nerves have been shaken by an upsurge in earthquakes want to know what’s causing the temblors — and what can be done to stop them.\n\nabout why their state has been having so many earthquakes all of a sudden, according to the Globe-Gazzette.com.\n\nJust as important, a win would mean that the Americans have defeated one of soccer’s oligarchs at a World Cup, with both sides trying their best for a victory. That by itself would be a precedent-setting result.\n\nBefore the tournament, most people thought it would be an unlikely success for the U.S. just to get out of the so-called Group of Death and to the Round of 16. Now, after beating Ghana and dominating much of the game against Portugal, the U.S. can dream bigger. Beat Germany, and America wins its group for the second straight World Cup, a result nearly unthinkable when the draw was announced in December. Beat Germany, and the U.S. secures a favorable Round of 16 match most likely against Algeria or Russia, rather than a trickier faceoff with sneaky-good Belgium.\n\nAll the focus on permutations and goal-differential scenarios has undercut the importance of today’s game for American soccer. There’s not as much at stake, goes the implication, because we can move ahead even if we lose to Germany. But this is about more than getting to the next round. This is an opportunity for the U.S. to face one of soccer’s elite teams on the biggest stage and prove it can hang with—even beat—any country in this World Cup.\n\nIn the wake of the U.S. team’s  heartbreaking come-from-ahead draw  against Portugal in the World Cup on Sunday, soccer analysts and Twitter users scrambled to figure out the many ways the U.S. can still get to the next round. With a three-point lead over Portugal and Ghana in Group G, the Americans can advance even if they lose their match against Germany at noon Eastern today, depending on the outcome of the Portugal-Ghana game played at the same time. Deadspin has one of the better  graphical breakdown s of every potential scenario for the U.S., including the dreaded  drawing of lots .\n\n“By the way, you should act like a good leader and take the day off as well. Go USA! Signed Jurgen Klinsmann, Head Coach, U.S. National team”.\n\n“The #USMNT (U.S. Men’s National Team) has a critical World Cup game vs Germany and we will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round.\n\n“I understand that this absence may reduce the productivity of your workplace, but I can assure you that it is for an important cause,” wrote Klinsmann.\n\nIn the style of a ‘doctor’s note’, Klinsmann addresses employers and asks them to forgive their staff for their absence.\n\nKlinsman suggested that U.S. fans should take a day off work to watch the game, and wrote a letter to bosses asking them to excuse their employee’s absences, reports Reuters.\n\n“I think some people might be a little bit surprised at our results so far,” coach Jurgen Klinsmann said Wednesday. “We are by no means any underdog here in this tournament, but we know it’s the biggest hurdle we have to take now with Germany.”\n\nTeam USA began their World Cup run in the so-called “group of death,” but their aggression, attacks and overall stamina on the pitch have defied pundits who originally dismissed their chances of advancing.\n\n“This is the biggest game of a lot of our lives, so any fatigue in our legs will be erased,” said American midfielder Kyle Beckerman. “We’ve got to give everything we’ve got and more.”\n\nPlayers spent the three days between matches recovering and regrouping after a  physical first game against Ghana  and an  emotional tie against Portugal .\n\nTeam USA was greeted with cheers from American fans Wednesday as they arrived in the Brazilian city of Recife.\n\nIt’s been a roller coaster ride for the American team so far in the  World Cup . The team that, on paper, many pundits didn’t expect to advance, now has a real shot at moving on to the second round. And as CBS News’ Elaine Quijano reports, that fate is hinged on beating or at least coming up even against one of the cup favorites, Germany.\n\n“A number of states, including my home state of Maine, have now legalized same-sex marriage, and I agree with that decision,” Collins said in a statement, adding later: “I have long opposed efforts to impose a federal ban on same-sex marriage. In both 2004 and 2006, I voted against amendments to the United States Constitution that would have banned same-sex marriages by preempting state laws.”\n\nIn another breakthrough, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine has announced that she supports same-sex marriage. From The Washington Post:\n\n“The Indiana ruling invalidating its ban today also used similar reasoning,” Tobias says. “All courts are finding that the bans violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th amendment.”\n\n“The 4th Circuit [in Virginia] may well apply the reasoning of the 10th Circuit opinion, as will numerous district courts that have yet to rule,” he says.\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, writes NPR in an email that the Utah decision “is very significant, as [it is] the first appellate court to address the marriage equality issue.\n\nBoth decisions are significant in that they may influence decisions in other states.\n\nIn Indiana, Young wrote: “Same-sex couples, who would otherwise qualify to marry in Indiana, have the right to marry in Indiana. … These couples, when gender and sexual orientation are taken away, are in all respects like the family down the street. The Constitution demands that we treat them as such.”\n\n“It is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples,” the three-judge panel in the Utah case said. The panel immediately put the ruling on hold pending its appeal, either to the entire 10th Circuit or directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, according to The Associated Press.\n\nIn Utah, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld a lower court ruling striking down the state’s gay-marriage ban. And in Indiana, U.S. District Judge Richard Young  made a similar ruling.\n\nUtah and  Indiana  are the latest states to see their bans on same-sex marriage struck down by a federal court, following rulings in both states Wednesday that found the prohibition unconstitutional.\n\nThe seafloor search, he said, should start around August and be completed within one year. The area is 58 miles wide and 400 miles long, covering an area as big as Lake Huron, the second-largest of the U.S. Great Lakes. By comparison, the area searched with a robotic, sonar-equipped submarine in May was about 330 square miles.\n\nAustralia Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the search was continuing with a mapping of the ocean floor in the newly defined area, to be followed by a comprehensive seafloor search.\n\nThe new zone, about 1,100 miles west of Perth, Australia, is farther south than where previous intensive search efforts were carried out this spring after the plane vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard. The flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it went missing….\n\nExperts from Boeing and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board were among the specialists who helped define the zone, based on satellite data and analysis of previous similar incidents.\n\nBased on the report, a new search zone has been designated, according to the LA Times:\n\n“Given these observations, the final stages of the unresponsive crew/hypoxia event type appeared to best fit the available evidence for the final period of MH370’s flight when it was heading in a generally southerly direction,” the document said.\n\nEvidence for an unresponsive crew as the plane flew south includes the loss of radio communications, a long period with no maneuvering of the aircraft, a steadily maintained cruise altitude and eventual fuel exhaustion and descent, the report said.\n\nPilots are trained to put on oxygen masks immediately if an aircraft suffers depressurization; their masks have an hour’s air supply, compared with only a few minutes for the passengers. The plane, which left Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, bound for Beijing, with 239 people aboard, made its turn south toward the Indian Ocean about an hour after it stopped responding to air-traffic controllers….\n\nA report issued by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, outlining how the new search zone had been chosen, said that the most likely scenario as the aircraft headed south across the Indian Ocean on March 8 was that the crew was suffering from hypoxia or was otherwise unresponsive.\n\nBut exactly why the autopilot would have been set on a flight path so far off course from the jet’s destination of Beijing, and exactly when it was switched on remains unknown.\n\nAsked whether the autopilot would have to be manually switched on, or whether it could have been activated automatically under a default setting, Dolan replied, “The basic assumption would be that if the autopilot is operational it’s because it’s been switched on.”\n\n“Certainly for its path across the Indian Ocean, we are confident that the aircraft was operating on autopilot until it ran out of fuel,” Dolan told reporters in Canberra, the nation’s capital.\n\nAfter analyzing data exchanged between the plane and a satellite, officials believe Flight 370 was on autopilot the entire time it was flying across a vast expanse of the southern Indian Ocean, based on the straight path it took, Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Martin Dolan said.\n\nSYDNEY, Australia — Investigators looking into the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines plane are confident it was on autopilot when it crashed in a remote stretch of the Indian Ocean, Australian officials said Thursday as they announced the latest shift in the search for the jet.\n\nWolf Blitzer must be celebrating this morning, because the mystery plane is back in the headlines.\n\nWhat else is happening? Please post your links on any topic in the comment thread.\n\nSo . . . draw your own conclusions. My guess is we’ll be reading and hearing quite a bit more about the Times and its history of gender discrimination over the next few days.\n\nTwo other editors also voiced their concerns, sources with knowledge of the meeting told Capital. National editor Alison Mitchell suggested that Abramson’s firing wouldn’t sit well with a broad swath of female Timesjournalists who saw her as a role model. (Abramson became the Times‘ first female executive editor in 2011, after Bill Keller stepped down.) Assistant managing editor Susan Chira seconded that notion.\n\nNot everyone was buying it. When Sulzberger said he was sure it doesn’t “come as a surprise to you,” video editor Bruce Headlam spoke up in Abramson’s defense, according to a person who was present. “It does come as a surprise to me,” the source recalls him saying.\n\nSulzberger gave the same vague reasoning for the change that would be relayed in a company memo and at a full newsroom meeting shortly thereafter—that the decision had to do with Abramson’s newsroom management.\n\n[T]he news…came as a shock to most of the assembled editors. There had been none of the drama or widespread discontent that led up to the famous firing of Howell Raines in 2003. In fact when they arrived in the room, their first inkling of what was about to transpire was the fact that Abramson was not present.\n\nThat was the note top editors at The New York Times received this afternoon summoning them to an abrupt gathering in which publisher and Times Company chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. would inform them that executive editor Jill Abramson was  being replaced in the No. 1 masthead spot by one of her deputies, managing editor Dean Baquet ….\n\nAuletta claimed other Times staffers  were concerned about the pay disparity  between Abramson and Keller. He said it brought up “ugly memories”  of a 1974 lawsuit  female employees made against the paper due to allegations of sex discrimination in hiring, pay, and promotion.\n\nAt Business Insider, Hunter Walker calls attention to the Times’ past problems with gender disparities in pay (also mentioned by Ken Auletta in The New Yorker piece linked above):\n\nHmmm . . . Sounds like Sultzberger thought Abramson might have grounds to sue if he didn’t settle with her.\n\nThe Times article notes in passing that Abramson reached a settlement with the Times, which makes pretty clear that whatever might have happened with disparate pay or a connection between her pressing the matter and her firing there will not be a lawsuit.\n\nThe other issues Auletta mentions are similar to those described in the NYT article: she had problems with Baquet and those who worked under her sometimes complained she was “brusque” (as opposed to Mr. Personality, Bill Keller?). Again, it sounds to me as if Abraham’s biggest “problem” was her gender. Mr. Baquet sounds pretty “pushy” too, but for him that was acceptable, I guess. Josh Marshall at TPM points out that:\n\nAs with any such upheaval, there’s a history behind it. Several weeks ago, I’m told, Abramson discovered that her pay and her pension benefits as both executive editor and, before that, as managing editor were considerably less than the pay and pension benefits of Bill Keller, the male editor whom she replaced in both jobs. “She confronted the top brass,” one close associate said, and this may have fed into the management’s narrative that she was “pushy,” a characterization that, for many, has an inescapably gendered aspect. Sulzberger is known to believe that the  Times , as a financially beleaguered newspaper, needed to retreat on some of its generous pay and pension benefits; Abramson, who spent much of her career at the  Wall Street Journal , had been at the  Times  for far fewer years than Keller, which accounted for some of the pension disparity. Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for the  Times , said that Jill Abramson’s total compensation as executive editor “was directly comparable to Bill Keller’s”—though it was not actually the same. I was also told by another friend of Abramson’s that the pay gap with Keller was only closed after she complained. But, to women at an institution that was once sued by its female employees for discriminatory practices, the question brings up ugly memories. Whether Abramson was right or wrong, both sides were left unhappy. A third associate told me, “She found out that a former deputy managing editor”—a man—“made more money than she did” while she was managing editor. “She had a lawyer make polite inquiries about the pay and pension disparities, which set them off.”\n\nApparently, the real problem Sultzberg had with Abramson was that she was an uppity woman.\n\nFellow-journalists and others scrambled to find out what had happened. Sulzberger had fired Abramson, and he did not try to hide that. In a speech to the newsroom on Wednesday afternoon, he said, “I chose to appoint a new leader of our newsroom because I believe that new leadership will improve some aspects …” Abramson chose not to attend the announcement, and not to pretend that she had volunteered to step down.\n\nAt the annual City University Journalism School dinner, on Monday, Dean Baquet, the managing editor of the New York  Times , was seated with Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., the paper’s publisher. At the time, I did not give a moment’s thought to why Jill Abramson, the paper’s executive editor, was not at their table. Then, at 2:36  P.M.  on Wednesday, an announcement from the  Times  hit my e-mail, saying that Baquet would replace Abramson, less than three years after she was appointed the first woman in the top job. Baquet will be the first African-American to lead the  Times .\n\nLet’s see . . . Abramson was “polarizing and mercurial,” “was accused by some of divisiveness,” and her male second in command didn’t like taking orders from her, have I got that right? Is it just me, or do those sound like code words?\n\nWith Mr. Sulzberger more closely monitoring her stewardship, tensions between Ms. Abramson and Mr. Baquet escalated. In one publicized incident, he angrily  slammed his hand against a wall  in the newsroom. He had been under consideration for the lead job when Ms. Abramson was selected and, according to people familiar with his thinking, he was growing frustrated working with her.\n\nBut as a leader of the newsroom, she was accused by some of divisiveness and criticized for several of her personnel choices, in particular the appointment of several major department heads who did not last long in their jobs.\n\nThe Times won eight Pulitzer Prizes under Ms. Abramson, and she won praise for journalistic efforts both in print and on the web. She had previously served as the head of the Washington bureau, and before coming to The Times was an investigative reporter at The Wall Street Journal. She co-wrote, with Ms. [Jane ] Mayer [of the New Yorker], “Strange Justice,” a book about the confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nIn recent weeks, these people said, Mr. Baquet had become angered over a decision by Ms. Abramson to make a job offer to a senior editor from The Guardian, Janine Gibson, and install her alongside him in a co-managing editor position without consulting him. It escalated the conflict between them and rose to the attention of Mr. Sulzberger.\n\nMs. Abramson, 60, had been in the job only since September 2011. But people in the company briefed on the situation described serious tension in her relationship with Mr. Sulzberger, who was concerned about complaints from employees that she was polarizing and mercurial. She had also had clashes with Mr. Baquet.\n\nArthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of the paper and the chairman of The New York Times Company, told a stunned newsroom that had been quickly assembled that he had made the decision because of “an issue with management in the newsroom.”\n\nNews broke late yesterday afternoon that New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson had suddenly been replaced by Managing Editor Dean Baquet.

Suggestions for its source have ranged from fish to ships.\n\nThe strange sound was first detected by submarines about 50 years ago. Those who heard it were surprised by its quack-like qualities.\n\nThe rest of this story sounds like something out of The Incredible Mr. Limpet (1964) :\n\n“Over the years there have been several suggestions… but no-one was able to really show this species was producing the sound until now.”\n\nLead researcher Denise Risch, from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) Northeast Fisheries Science Center in Massachusetts, said: “It was hard to find the source of the signal.\n\nNow acoustic recorders have revealed that the sound is in fact the underwater chatter of the Antarctic minke whale.\n\nThe noise – nicknamed “the bio-duck” – appears in the winter and spring in the Southern Ocean. However, its source has baffled researchers for decades.\n\nFinally, not all things that quack like a duck…turn out to be a duck. For the last 50 years there has been these strange quacking sounds heard from the Southern Ocean that has kept people wondering…what the hell is it?   Mystery of ‘ocean quack sound’ solved\n\nBut that doesn’t mean shit to the assholes who run the states like mine.\n\nExpanding Medicaid was already a pretty good deal for states given that the federal government will cover the entire cost for several years and the overwhelming majority of costs thereafter, but the deal just got sweeter.\n\nThe federal government will cover 100 percent of the cost of expanding Medicaid until 2017 and, while it was projected that the government would cover 90 percent of the cost beyond that time period, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) now projects that the federal government will cover more than 95 percent until at least 2024.\n\nStates will spend only 1.6 percent more on Medicaid and CHIP due to health reform than they would have spent without health reform. That’s about one-third less than CBO projected in February. And the 1.6 percent figure is before counting the state savings that the Medicaid expansion will produce in state expenditures for services such as mental health and substance abuse treatment provided to the uninsured.\n\nCBO now estimates that the federal government will, on average, pick up more than 95 percent of the total cost of the Medicaid expansion and other health reform-related costs in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) over the next ten years (2015-2024).\n\nAnd it goes hand in hand with this from the Daily Banter: Medicaid Expansion Will Cost States Even Less Than Expected | BobCesca.com\n\nHuffington Post had a link to an interactive article from the NY Times, from back in January.

She was convicted of a lesser battery offense and sentenced to two years of probation.\n\nAlbuquerque police said an officer shot and killed an auto theft suspect early Monday, the third shooting by officers in the troubled department in just over a month and the first after a federal investigation faulted the department for excessive force and a culture of abuse and aggression.\n\nI don’t know…the whole thing is fucked up.

Doesn’t that just fill you full of the holiday spirit?!\n\nParents in the West End of Virginia discovered, much to their horror, that amongst the Easter eggs planted for egg hunts, there were eggs that contained messages from a white supremacist group. One family discovered an egg with a little piece of paper “‘Diversity’ = White Genocide” at the top. Here’s what it read:\n\nThat is a great way to introduce this little tidbit of news from a disturbing Easter Egg incident in Virginia (with snark of course): Some White Supremacists Planted Easter Eggs with Racist Messages in Them | Mediaite\n\nJustice Sotomayor recast the line. “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race,” she wrote, “is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race, and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination.”\n\nJustice Sotomayor seemed to mock one of Chief Justice Roberts’s most memorable lines. In a 2007 decision that limited the use of race to achieve integration in public school systems, he wrote, “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”\n\n“The Constitution does not protect racial minorities from political defeat,” she wrote. “But neither does it give the majority free rein to erect selective barriers against racial minorities.” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the dissent.\n\nSignaling deep displeasure, Justice Sotomayor summarized her dissent from the bench, an unusual move that happens perhaps three times a term. She said the initiative put minorities to a burden not faced by other college applicants. Athletes, children of alumni and students from underrepresented parts of the state, she said, remained free to try to persuade university officials to give their applications special weight. “The one and only policy a Michigan citizen may not seek through this long-established process,” she wrote, “is a race-sensitive admissions policy.” That difference, she said, violates the Constitution’s equal protection clause.\n\nHer opinion, longer than the four other opinions combined, appeared to reflect her own experiences with affirmative action at Princeton and Yale Law School. “I had been admitted to the Ivy League through a special door,” she wrote in her best-selling memoir, “My Beloved World.” For years, she wrote, “I lived the day-to-day reality of affirmative action.”\n\nBut Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in the longest, most passionate and most significant dissent of her career, said the Constitution required special vigilance in light of the history of slavery, Jim Crow and “recent examples of discriminatory changes to state voting laws.”\n\nIn five separate opinions spanning more than 100 pages, the justices set out starkly conflicting views. The justices in the majority, with varying degrees of vehemence, said that policies affecting minorities that do not involve intentional discrimination should be decided at the ballot box rather than in the courtroom.\n\nStates that forbid affirmative action in higher education, like Florida and California, as well as Michigan, have seen a significant drop in the enrollment of black and Hispanic students in their most selective colleges and universities.\n\nThe 6-to-2 ruling effectively endorsed similar measures in seven other states. It may also encourage more states to enact measures banning the use of race in admissions or to consider race-neutral alternatives to ensure diversity.\n\nIn a fractured decision that revealed deep divisions over what role the judiciary should play in protecting racial and ethnic minorities, the Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld a Michigan constitutional amendment that bans affirmative action in admissions to the state’s public universities.\n\nYes, he is what you think he is.\n\nAnd the one image that is my absolute favorite…which goes without saying….\n\nThe pictures for today’s post were found on pinterest of course, you can see some of the images here:\n\nThe protest is planned for a full week, let’s see what comes of it.\n\nThe Cowboy and Indian Alliance has four days of events planned, including documentary screenings, meetings with environmental groups and elected leaders, traditional Native American ceremonies and delivering a teepee painted by the activists to the Museum of the American Indian in honor of Obama, as a sign of respect. The week will culminate in a rally on Saturday that organizers are expecting to attract 5,000 protestors.\n\n“What the hell? What is wrong with the American public that they are complacent in this?” she said. “This is a foreign corporation that’s going to make billions off our backs. We won’t allow them to go — we will lay our bodies on the line with the Native Americans.”\n\nDonna Roller, 62, who owns a farm in York County, Neb., was appalled that more of the public was not up in arms that a foreign oil company — TransCanada, the owner of the pipeline — was marching into the United States and trampling on American land rights.\n\n“I raise horses on a small ranch and they can’t drink oil. Sooner or later, that thing’s going to leak,” said Mike Blocker, 62, whose ranch is in Antelope County in Nebraska, directly in the path of the pipeline. “How can you sleep at night knowing that 830,000 pounds of this crap is flowing underground where you live?”\n\n“We’re here to help protect the water, our first medicine,” he said. “Our most abundant resource is being destroyed by man.”\n\nBlack Eagle Man said too that Native Americans were committed to being good stewards of the earth’s resources.\n\n“For 500 years, our people have been suffering,” he said. “The government gave us the most desolate places in the country for our reservations. Now they want to build a pipeline on our land.”\n\nMatthew Black Eagle Man, a 45-year-old member of the Sioux Long Plain First Nation tribe in Manitoba, Canada, said the government attempting to build a pipeline on Native American lands continues a longstanding pattern of abuse inflicted on indigenous people.\n\nThe ranchers and Native Americans — about 40 of whom led a procession on horseback before coming to the National Mall to set up a camp of teepees — said they wanted to ensure lawmakers and the Obama administration were hearing them loud and clear about their qualms.\n\nMany see the issue as the defining test of  President Barack Obama’s commitment to the environment .

This was a crime that shocked and outraged America and the world, and still horrifies and fascinates people to this day. At The New Yorker, Nicholas Lehmann describes some of the reasons this news story has become so iconic and reviews two new books on the case. Lehmann argues that New York Times editor Abe Rosenthal created a news environment in which this particular murder became the focus of so much attention. Lehmann deliberately shaped the coverage of the murder in a sensational and misleading manner. The story ended up as the focus of a classic psychological study.\n\na post about this in August 2009, and I thought I’d put that post up again today.\n\nI wrote a piece about this in August 2009. I thought I’d repost it today. I’ve made a few minor edits to the original. At the end, I list some recent books and articles for further reading.\n\nOn March 13, 1964, at around 3:30AM, there was a murder in the Kew Gardens section of Queens, New York. The murder probably wouldn’t have gotten much publicity at all if it hadn’t been for a sensational article that appeared on the front page of The New York Times, a couple of weeks later. The Times story led to groundbreaking research in social psychology and the discovery of new and counter-intuitive information about human behavior.\n\nIt was very late, very cold, and very dark when 28-year-old Catherine “Kitty” Genovese parked her car at the Kew Gardens train station after driving from Ev’s Eleventh Hour Bar in Hollis, where she worked nights as manager. When she got out of her car, she saw a stranger walking toward her. The man, Winston Mosley, 29, stabbed Genovese two times as she hurried past a bookstore on Austin Street, pehaps headed a local bar named Bailey’s to seek assistance. She called out, “Oh my God. He stabbed me. Please help me,” and fell to the ground. Winston was leaning over her to stab her again, when he heard a man’s voice calling from a window in an apartment building across the street, “Leave that girl alone!”\n\nStartled, Mosley ran down an alley, got into his car, and backed up, ready to drive off. Lights had gone on in the nearby apartment building, but they went off again. Mosley got out of the car and again followed Genovese, who had reached the doorway of her apartment building, which was in the back of the building at 82-62 Austin Street. As she fell forward through the doorway, crying out, “I’m dying, I’m dying,” Winston caught up with her, stabbed her again, and then raped her. A short time later, a neighbor, Greta Schwartz, who had called the police after receiving a phone call from another neighbor, ran down to the lobby and cradled Kitty in her lap until the paramedics arrived.\n\nFrom interviews in the neighborhoods of the two stabbing incidents, police learned that as many as 37 people had seen or heard part of the stalking and murder of Kitty Genovese by Winston Mosley, but supposedly none of them had called the police except Greta Schwartz.\n\nThe New York Times Breaks the Story\n\nOn March 27, 1964, The New York Times published a front page story by Martin Gansberg (Warning, PDF) headlined “37 Who Saw Murder Didn’t Call Police.”\n\nJust that brief excerpt contains a number of inaccuracies, which I’ll get to a little later. Nevertheless, it was from this newspaper article that Americans–and people around the world–formed their lasting impressions of the tragic death of Kitty Genovese. The story shocked the nation; everyone was talking about how terrible it was that in big cities like New York, people just didn’t seem to get to know their neighbors or care about them. Those of us who lived in small cities and towns were sure things would be different in our neighborhoods.\n\nIn 1968, J.M. Darley and B. Latane published a study (pdf) in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that was inspired by the supposed behavior of the 37 “witnesses” to Kitty Genovese’s murder. They hypothesized that the reason bystanders did not take action was “diffusion of responsibility,” and that the more bystanders in an emergency situation, the more these bystanders believe that “someone else will help, so I don’t need to.”\n\nParticipants in the study were college students in an introductory psychology class at New York University.\n\n Darley and Latane told participants that they wanted to study how students adjust to university life in a highly competitive, urban environment. They said they wanted participants to discuss their problems honestly with other students; and in order to avoid personal discomfort, participants would sit in separate rooms equipped with an intercom system.\n\nThere were three different groups. Students in group one were told they would be talking with one other person. In group two, students were told there would be two other people on the intercome with them. Group five was told there would be five other people listening in to the conversation. In reality, all of the students were alone and they the other voices they heard were on tape. The emergency was that one of the participants in the discussion has epileptic seizure (the sounds of the seizure were actually played on tape).\n\nAs the intercom discussions began, students heard the first student, a male, tell about his difficulties concentrating on his studies and problems adjusting to life in New York City. He then added, with some embarrassment, that he sometimes had severe seizures, especially when under a lot of stress. Then the conversation switched to the next student. In group 1, the actual student’s turn came next. In the other two groups, the real student heard one or more other students speak first. After the real student took a turn speaking, the first “student” again started to speak normally, then began having a seizure, and asked for help. Darley and Latane measured how long it took subjects to help the student in trouble (helping was defined as leaving the cubicle and notifying an experimenter of the problem).\n\nWhy? Not because they were apathetic. All subjects were anxious and showed physical signs of nervousness. Darley and Latane conclued that as the number of people involved in an emergency situation increase, it’s easier for bystanders to assume that someone else will handle it; and the potential guilt for not helping is divided up. Other possible reasons for failure to act are fear of embarrassment or ridicule, fear that they are misinterpreting the situation. The authors also pointed out that most people don’t have much experience with emergency situations and are likely to become confused or overwhelmed when they encounter one.\n\nJoseph De May, Jr., and the Kew Gardens History Page\n\nIn 2000, Joseph De May, who had lived in Kew Gardens since 1974, decided to build a website that would contain a comprehensive pictorial history of the neighborhood. As part of his project, De May dug up as much information as he could about the Kitty Genovese murder and then critiqued the original New York Times article and debunked some myths that had grown up around the case. Here is the “short version” of his critique:\n\n# There were only 2 attacks, not 3. # The attacks were not continuous. There was about a 10 min. interval between them when the killer moved his car to a parking place farther away. # There were not 38 eye witnesses to either of the attacks. Only 3 people are known to have seen one or the other of the stabbings. # The first attack on Austin Street – the one that awakened the witnesses – was likely over before all but a few of the witnesses got to their windows. # Probably many more than 38 were ear witnesses to Kitty’s screams. However, that first attack occurred a few yards away from a bar known for its late night rowdiness. # After the first attack, Kitty left the scene under her own power without making any outcries for help. # The second attack took place in a small vestibule in the rear of a building where only one witness was in a position to see it. # Given the layout of the crime scene, it would have been impossible for anyone to have seen or heard everything. # Assuming the police were not timely called – a big assumption in my opinion – there were reasons apart from apathy why they were not.\n\nFurthermore, a 15-year-old boy named Michael Hoffman saw Winston Mosley run away after the first attack in front of the bookstore and saw Kitty Genovese get up and stagger in the other direction. He didn’t know there had been a stabbing, but he told his father what he had seen and the father called the police. The police later admitted they had received several other calls. One man did see the knife and understood that a woman was being stabbed. This man never called the police and couldn’t explain his inaction. At least five other people saw Mosley return to the original scene, but by that time Kitty Genovese was gone.\n\nThere were two attacks, not three as the New York Times reported. A man on the first floor of Kitty’s building open his door and saw the final attack. He wanted to call police, but said his wife didn’t want him to get involved. He went to Greta Schwartz’s apartment and asked her to call police, which she did. She then ran downstairs with a friend, found Kitty still alive and cradled her until an ambulance arrived. Also contrary to The New York Times story, the occupants of Kitty Genovese’s apartments building knew and were friendly with each other. Many knew and liked Kitty and her roomate Mary Ann Zielonko.\n\nIn 2004, on the fortieth anniversary of Kitty Genovese’s death, Mary Ann Zielonko came forward and talked about Kitty publicly for the first time. She was interviewed on NPR’s Weekend Edition Saturday. In the interview, Zielonko, who now lives in Vermont, revealed that she and Kitty Genovese were lovers. A lesbian blogger in Vermont wrote a piece about her own feelings after she learned about Kitty’s sexual orientation.\n\nHearing that Genovese was a lesbian has shaken up my psyche. Genovese’s name was always a cautionary tale – about being a woman alone in the city at night, about the need to care and take action in the face of assault. But now it’s also somehow more about me as a lesbian, about our denied and undiscovered herstory, about the dangers we faced then – and now. In 1964, it was not okay to be queer. The only place to go to hold your lover’s hand in semi-public was a bar. Mary Ann remembers the Swing Rendezvous on MacDougal St. and the Seven Steps on Houston. Police raids and being beaten up for wearing butch or femme drag were common events. Until now we’ve never had the opportunity to ask whether the neighbors’ indifference might have had an element of homophobia (not that the word existed then). Kitty and Mary Ann lived together in the apartment Kitty was so desperately trying to reach that March night. Mary Ann says some of the neighbors suspected they were lesbians, because they were always together. “But we didn’t look ‘gay,’ whatever that means.” Mary Ann got home from her own shift tending bar and went to sleep – until the police knocked at her door at 4 a.m. and drove her from the tree-lined streets of their Kew Gardens, Queens, neighborhood where Kitty died, to the hospital morgue to identify Kitty’s body.\n\nSome of the neighbors may have suspected that Kitty and Mary Ann were gay, but several reported in interviews that she was a friendly, smiling young woman whom they liked. A few told police and reporters that they “didn’t want to get involved,” but most weren’t sure what they had seen or heard and couldn’t say why they didn’t call for help. It was after 3AM on a winter night, in a neighborhood where there were often loud voices and even fighting among people leaving local bars. As with the participants in Darley and Latane’s study, some of the witnesses may have feared giving a false report to police and looking foolish.\n\nIn addition, Joseph De May reports that in those days, NYC police demanded that callers identify themselves rather than just accepting reports of emergencies. That may have deterred some from calling police or holding on long enough to get someone to listen. Even if witnesses had called police to report screaming or fighting, they would likely have taken a long time to respond, because of the bars in the area.\n\nIn 2004, The New York Times interviewed De May about his research.\n\nIn the end, Mr. De May’s conclusion about the murder is that, while the behavior of the witnesses was hardly beyond reproach, the common conception of exactly what occurred that night is not in fact what occurred. What did occur, he argues, is far more complex and far less damning to the residents of Kew Gardens. ”Yeah, there was a murder,” Mr. De May said. ”Yeah, people heard something. You can question how a few people behaved. But this wasn’t 38 people watching a woman be slaughtered for 35 minutes and saying, ‘Oh, I don’t want to be involved.”’ Mr. De May began his research with the seminal Times article of March 27, 1964. ”I remember reading through it, then putting it down and thinking, ‘Well, this doesn’t hang together at all,”’ he said. ”And then I read it again carefully. I knew the area. I knew the crime scene because I go by there every day.” Mr. De May soon found himself poring through legal documents related to the case, scouring books and articles, and interviewing neighbors. At one point, he even ran the route of Ms. Genovese’s flight up Austin Street, timing it with a watch. He became convinced that his first impression was correct. ”Here’s something that everyone thinks happened,” he said, ”that isn’t so.”\n\nKitty’s murderer had no idea that she was a lesbian. He had set out that night to kill a woman. He was certainly a sociopath and may have been a serial killer. He confessed to having killed at least one other woman after he was arrested for the Genovese murder. In 1968, Mosley managed to escape from police custody and raped a pregnant woman in her home. In April, 2008, the New York Daily News reported on Mosley’s latest parole hearing.\n\nIn 2008, Charles E.

            "text": "A US federal appeals court has struck down Utah's gay marriage ban, ruling the law unconstitutionally discriminates against same-sex couples.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the Denver-based 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower federal court's ruling.\n\nThe decision marks the first time a federal appeals court has ruled on same-sex marriage.\n\nGay-marriage backers have won a series of cases, but the issue is likely to be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 10th Circuit panel found that US states cannot deprive citizens of the right to marry because they desire to wed someone of the same sex.\n\nIt upheld a December ruling of the lower federal district court of Utah.\n\nThe appeals panel immediately put its 2-1 decision on hold, however, pending an appeal.\n\n\"It is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples,\" the appeals court judges wrote.\n\nFollowing the ruling, the Utah attorney general's office announced it planned to appeal against the decision to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Although the Court's 2-1 split decision does not favour the State, we are pleased that the ruling has been issued and takes us one step closer to reaching certainty and finality for all Utahns on such an important issue with a decision from the highest court,\" the office said.\n\nRepublican Governor Gary Herbert also wrote he was disappointed by the court's decision and said it should be left to states to determine their own laws on the matter.\n\nIf not reversed, the ruling will become law in six states covered by the court: New Mexico, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Utah.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, a federal judge struck down Indiana's ban on same-sex marriage, immediately allowing gay couples to wed in the state.\n\nUS District Judge Richard Young ruled the ban violated the Constitution's equal-protection clause.\n\n\"Same-sex couples, who would otherwise qualify to marry in Indiana, have the right to marry in Indiana,\" he wrote.\n\n\"These couples, when gender and sexual orientation are taken away, are in all respects like the family down the street. The constitution demands that we treat them as such.\"\n\nThe Indiana attorney general's office has also said it will appeal against the ruling.\n\nSixteen federal judges have ruled in favour of gay marriage since the US Supreme Court struck down the federal anti-gay Defense of Marriage Act in 2013.\n\nSame-sex marriage is currently legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia.",

            "text": "Utah and Indiana became the latest U.S. states to see their bans on same-sex marriage struck down following separate rulings in federal court on Wednesday.\n\n\"It is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples,\" a three-judge panel in the Utah case said while upholding a lower court ruling, NPR reported.\n\nBack in December, Utah briefly became the 18th state where gay couples received the right to marry, after a federal district judge ruled that the state's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. The decision was then put on hold pending appeals, though more than 1,300 gay and lesbian couples managed to get married before that.\n\nWednesday's decision, which resulted from a 2-1 split decision, has been put on hold, pending appeal which could go directly to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Indiana, District Judge Richard Young, who also upheld a lower court ruling, added: \"Same-sex couples, who would otherwise qualify to marry in Indiana, have the right to marry in Indiana. ... These couples, when gender and sexual orientation are taken away, are in all respects like the family down the street. The Constitution demands that we treat them as such.\"\n\nIndiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller has filed a notice of appeal and an emergency request for a stay of Young's order, The Courier-Journal reported.\n\n\n\nSure, take it to SCOTUS. But in the meantime get an order restraining this ruling. If not, nullify. Federal acts and rulings like these that are flatly, blatantly, and egregiously unconstitutional need to be nullified and discounted by the states. It's time for the states and the people to assert their God-given rights and freedoms as protected by the Constitution and affirmed by the Tenth Amendment. \n\n\n\nWhy even bother with voting on propositions at the state level, when a federal court can just smack you down at their leisure? Why even bother with state elections, or even state governments for that matter? The states roll over and do whatever the feds tell them to do anyhow, and not one of them ever push back. 10th amendment? Not anymore. \n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

            "text": "DENVER (AP) - A federal appeals court on Friday ruled Oklahoma must allow gay couples to wed, marking the second time it has found the U.S. Constitution protects same-sex marriage.\n\nThe decision from a three-judge panel in Denver upholds rulings that struck down Oklahoma's gay marriage ban.\n\nThe 2-1 ruling comes after the same panel ruled June 25 that Utah's ban on same-sex marriage violates the Constitution. It was the first time an appellate court determined last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act means states cannot deny gays the ability to wed.\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel put its Oklahoma and Utah rulings on hold pending an appeal. Utah's attorney general has said he plans to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nGay marriage in the two states will remain on hold.\n\nStill, the decisions give increased momentum to a legal cause that has compiled an impressive string of lower court victories. More than 20 courts have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates since the Supreme Court's DOMA ruling in June 2013. The rulings have come in 17 states, with Florida being the latest.\n\nTwo of the most striking of those decisions were in conservative Utah and Oklahoma, which saw their voter-approved gay marriage bans struck down in December and January, respectively. In Utah, more than 1,000 same-sex couples married before the Supreme Court issued a stay.\n\nIt's unclear whether the two cases will be the first to reach the Supreme Court. The high court could choose from cases moving through five other federal appellate courts, and it won't consider a case until next year at the earliest.\n\nAttorneys representing Utah and Oklahoma argued voters have the right to define marriage in their states, and unions between a man and woman are best for children.\n\nGay rights lawyers countered that voters cannot define marriage in a way that deprives gay people of their fundamental rights, and say there is no proof that gay couples make inferior parents.\n\nTen years ago, nearly a dozen states outlawed gay marriage.

However, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel immediately put the ruling on hold so it could be appealed, either to the entire 10th Circuit or directly to the nation's highest court.\n\n\"All I can say is that we are thrilled,\" said Kody Partridge, one of the plaintiffs.\n\nThe office of Utah's attorney general said it plans to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. The office also left open the possibility of requesting a review from the full panel of judges at the 10th Circuit.\n\nThe three-judge appeals panel found that states cannot deprive people of the fundamental right to marry simply because they want to be wedded to someone of the same sex. The panel found it \"wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of the love and commitment between same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the couples named in the appeal hugged, cried and exchanged kisses at a news conference. Plaintiff Derek Kitchen said he and his partner, Moudi Sbeity, are \"so proud to be a part of history.\"\n\nThe decision gives increased momentum to a legal cause that already compiled an impressive winning streak in the lower courts after the Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defence of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates.\n\nThe latest of those rulings was in Indiana, where a federal judge on Wednesday struck down that state's same-sex marriage ban in a ruling that immediately allows gay couples to wed. The Indiana attorney general's office said it will appeal.\n\nEvan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, said Utah's legal victory was sweeter because of where it originated -- a conservative, deeply religious state in the heart of the mountain west.\n\nGay marriage opponents, meanwhile, have vowed to continue their fight. Along with the Catholic Church, several other major denominations remain adamant in opposing same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Utah, said in a statement on its website Wednesday that the church maintains marriage should be between a man and a woman but \"all people should be treated with respect.\"\n\nThe appellate ruling on Utah comes 42 years after the Supreme Court refused to hear a case of two men who were refused a marriage license in Minnesota, finding there was no legal issue for the justices to consider, and just 10 years after 11 states voted to outlaw gay marriage.\n\nNow same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the Washington capital district.

            "text": "A federal appeals court on Friday ruled Oklahoma must allow gay couples to wed, marking the second time it has found the U.S. Constitution protects same-sex marriage.\n\nThe decision from a three-judge panel in Denver upholds rulings that struck down Oklahoma's gay marriage ban.\n\nThe 2-1 ruling comes after the same panel ruled June 25 that Utah's ban on same-sex marriage violates the Constitution. It was the first time an appellate court determined last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act means states cannot deny gays the ability to wed.\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel put its Oklahoma and Utah rulings on hold pending an appeal. Utah's attorney general has said he plans to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nGay marriage in the two states will remain on hold.\n\nStill, the decisions give increased momentum to a legal cause that has compiled an impressive string of lower court victories. More than 20 courts have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates since the Supreme Court's DOMA ruling in June 2013. The rulings have come in 17 states, with Florida being the latest.\n\nTwo of the most striking of those decisions were in conservative Utah and Oklahoma, which saw their voter-approved gay marriage bans struck down in December and January, respectively. In Utah, more than 1,000 same-sex couples married before the Supreme Court issued a stay.\n\nIt's unclear whether the two cases will be the first to reach the Supreme Court. The high court could choose from cases moving through five other federal appellate courts, and it won't consider a case until next year at the earliest.\n\nAttorneys representing Utah and Oklahoma argued voters have the right to define marriage in their states, and unions between a man and woman are best for children.\n\nGay rights lawyers countered that voters cannot define marriage in a way that deprives gay people of their fundamental rights, and say there is no proof that gay couples make inferior parents.\n\nTen years ago, nearly a dozen states outlawed gay marriage. Now same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia, and recent polls show a majority of Americans support it.",

            "text": "A federal appeals court today declared Utah’s same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional in the first appellate ruling on state marriage laws as the issue makes its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided the issue by a 2-1 vote, with Judge Paul J. Kelly Jr. dissenting.\n\n“We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of the Fourteenth Amendment,” Kelly wrote in the dissenting opinion. The 14th Amendment guarantees all persons equal protection under the law.\n\nThe 10th Circuit includes Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming. All of those states except New Mexico also have bans on same-sex marriage. Wednesday’s decision will not take effect immediately because the court stayed its ruling until the nation’s highest court can consider the case.\n\nUtah was one of the first states in which a federal judge overturned a ban on same-sex marriage, citing the U.S. Constitution’s equal-protection clause. Judge Robert Shelby issued his ruling in late December. Six months later, judges in Oklahoma, Virginia, Texas, Kentucky, Michigan, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have issued nearly identical rulings.\n\nAfter Shelby’s ruling, the 10th Circuit denied Utah’s request to for a stay while it appealed the decision. Utah sent an emergency request to the Supreme Court, which unanimously issued a stay. Analysts say that decision indicates the court wants more discussion about states’ roles in defining marriage. The issue likely will be the highlight of the next Supreme Court term, which starts this fall.\n\nMeanwhile, federal district courts continue to weigh in on same-sex marriage state-by-state. A federal judge in Indiana on Wednesday also struck down its ban on gay marriage. Indiana outlawed same-sex marriage by statute in 1997, but has never passed a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between one man and one woman.\n\n“These couples, when gender and sexual orientation are taken away, are in all respects like the family down the street,” U.S. District Judge Richard Young wrote in his opinion. “The Constitution demands that we treat them as such.” The clerk of Marion County, home to Indianapolis, said the office would immediately start issuing marriage licenses to gay couples. The Indiana attorney general’s office plans to appeal the ruling.",

childe hassam – two women reading good morning wolf blitzer must be celebrating this morning because the mystery plane is back in the headlines associated press reports via ctv sydney australia — investigators looking into the disappearance of the malaysia airlines plane are confident it was on autopilot when it crashed in a remote stretch of the indian ocean australian officials said thursday as they announced the latest shift in the search for the jet after analyzing data exchanged between the plane and a satellite officials believe flight 370 was on autopilot the entire time it was flying across a vast expanse of the southern indian ocean based on the straight path it took australian transport safety bureau chief commissioner martin dolan said certainly for its path across the indian ocean we are confident that the aircraft was operating on autopilot until it ran out of fuel dolan told reporters in canberra the nations capital asked whether the autopilot would have to be manually switched on or whether it could have been activated automatically under a default setting dolan replied the basic assumption would be that if the autopilot is operational its because its been switched on but exactly why the autopilot would have been set on a flight path so far off course from the jets destination of beijing and exactly when it was switched on remains unknown the new york times explains what likely happened a report issued by the australian transport safety bureau outlining how the new search zone had been chosen said that the most likely scenario as the aircraft headed south across the indian ocean on march 8 was that the crew was suffering from hypoxia or was otherwise unresponsive hypoxia occurs when a plane loses air pressure and the pilots lacking adequate oxygen become confused and incapable of performing even basic manual tasks pilots are trained to put on oxygen masks immediately if an aircraft suffers depressurization their masks have an hours air supply compared with only a few minutes for the passengers the plane which left kuala lumpur malaysia bound for beijing with 239 people aboard made its turn south toward the indian ocean about an hour after it stopped responding to airtraffic controllers evidence for an unresponsive crew as the plane flew south includes the loss of radio communications a long period with no maneuvering of the aircraft a steadily maintained cruise altitude and eventual fuel exhaustion and descent the report said given these observations the final stages of the unresponsive crewhypoxia event type appeared to best fit the available evidence for the final period of mh370s flight when it was heading in a generally southerly direction the document said based on the report a new search zone has been designated according to the la times experts from boeing and the us national transportation safety board were among the specialists who helped define the zone based on satellite data and analysis of previous similar incidents the new zone about 1100 miles west of perth australia is farther south than where previous intensive search efforts were carried out this spring after the plane vanished march 8 with 239 people aboard the flight was en route from kuala lumpur to beijing when it went missing australia deputy prime minister warren truss said the search was continuing with a mapping of the ocean floor in the newly defined area to be followed by a comprehensive seafloor search the seafloor search he said should start around august and be completed within one year the area is 58 miles wide and 400 miles long covering an area as big as lake huron the secondlargest of the us great lakes by comparison the area searched with a robotic sonarequipped submarine in may was

gaymarriage bans in utah indiana utah and indiana are the latest states to see their bans on samesex marriage struck down by a federal court following rulings in both states wednesday that found the prohibition unconstitutional in utah the 10th circuit court of appeals panel upheld a lower court ruling striking down the states gaymarriage ban and in indiana us district judge richard young made a similar ruling it is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of samesex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of oppositesex couples the threejudge panel in the utah case said the panel immediately put the ruling on hold pending its appeal either to the entire 10th circuit or directly to the us supreme court according to the associated press in indiana young wrote samesex couples who would otherwise qualify to marry in indiana have the right to marry in indiana these couples when gender and sexual orientation are taken away are in all respects like the family down the street the constitution demands that we treat them as such both decisions are significant in that they may influence decisions in other states carl tobias a law professor at the university of richmond writes npr in an email that the utah decision is very significant as it is the first appellate court to address the marriage equality issue the 4th circuit in virginia may well apply the reasoning of the 10th circuit opinion as will numerous district courts that have yet to rule he says the indiana ruling invalidating its ban today also used similar reasoning tobias says all courts are finding that the bans violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th amendment in another breakthrough republican senator susan collins of maine

tournament but we know its the biggest hurdle we have to take now with germany klinsman suggested that us fans should take a day off work to watch the game and wrote a letter to bosses asking them to excuse their employees absences reports reuters in the style of a doctors note klinsmann addresses employers and asks them to forgive their staff for their absence the letter was distributed on social

cup before the tournament most people thought it would be an unlikely success for the us just to get out of the socalled group of death and to the round of 16 now after beating ghana and dominating much of the game against portugal the us can dream bigger beat germany and america wins its group for the second straight world cup a result nearly unthinkable when the draw was announced in december beat germany and the us secures a favorable round of 16 match most likely against algeria or russia rather than a trickier faceoff with sneakygood belgium just as important a win would mean that the

be almost unheard of on the vast stretches of prairie that unfold across texas kansas and oklahoma but theyve become common in recent years oklahoma recorded nearly 150 between january and the start of may though most have been too weak to cause serious damage or endanger lives theyve raised suspicions that the shaking might be connected to the oil and gas drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing especially the wells in which the industry disposes of its wastewater now after years of being harangued by anxious residents governments in all three states are confronting the issue reviewing scientific data holding public discussions and considering new regulations thursdays meeting in oklahoma will include the state agency that regulates oil and gas drilling and the oklahoma geological survey gee do you suppose it could have anything to do with fracking and what about all that wastewater that has to be disposed of in the fracking process from techsonia fracking fluid

potency to bind to sand grains with the wastewater colloids get released in to the ground water this study was published in the journal of the american chemical society and was conducted by the

now to talk about the premature end of barack obamas presidency hes fast approaching the second half of his second term which is historically the beginning of lameduck season his poll numbers arent what anyone would call ideal and republicans in concert with some excitable members of the press are rushing to proclaim the obama presidency dead i saw a commentator today say that these polls what they reflect is that the obama presidency is over sen marco rubio said referring to nbcs chuck todd and i agree with that i think it is in general speaker john boehner told reporters at his weekly press briefing yesterday you look at this presidency and you cant help but get the sense that the wheels are coming off the funny thing is that as republicans team up with pundits to chisel out obamas epitaph the republican party itself is falling to pieces right before our eyes yesterdays news that scott walker and chris christie sinking deeper into their respective scandals is as good a sign as any of the gops political disintegration after obama crushed mitt romney in 2012 republicans began casting about for their 2016 redeemer and christie and walker were high on the list they won conservative hearts with their antagonism toward unions but they had also found a way to win in reliably democratic states if the gop hoped to take on candidateinwaiting hillary clinton theyd need someone who could peel away some democratic voters walker had talked about the need to nominate an outsider like himself in 2016 now christie and walker are implicated in criminal investigations prosecutors in wisconsin placed walker at the center of a criminal scheme to coordinate campaign spending with outside groups in new jersey the investigation stemming from the george washington bridge scandal is reportedly closing in on christie himself for both men once considered potential saviors of the gop the political future looks considerably dimmer read malloys take on it at the link at fivethirtyeightpolitics david wasserman has a long article on what we can learn from eric cantors defeat you really need to read the whole thing but heres a small excerpt that deals with the contribution of public distrust of congress cantor was only the second house incumbent to lose a primary this year the first was texas republican ralph hall but the warning signs of discontent were abundant plenty of rankandfile house incumbents had been receiving startlingly low primary vote shares against weak and underfunded opponents including gop reps rodney davis of illinois lee terry of nebraska and david joyce of ohio in fact just a week before cantors defeat and without much fanfare socially moderate rep leonard lance of new jersey received just 54 percent of the republican primary vote against the same tea partybacked opponent he had taken 61 percent against in 2012 overall 32 house incumbents have taken less than 75 percent of the vote in their primaries so far this year up from 31 at this point in 2010 and just 12 at this point in 2006 whats more 27 of these 32 underperforming incumbents have been republicans 1 in other words while congresss unpopularity alone cant sink any given member in a primary it has established a higher baseline of distrust that challengers can build on when incumbents are otherwise vulnerable and as the sitting house majority leader cantor was uniquely susceptible to voters frustration with congress as an institution theres much more interesting analysis at the link george wills recent column on campus rapes is still in the news from talking points memo george wills latest college rape charges fueled by sea of hormones and alcohol will explained that he took issue with the practice of adjudicating campus sexual assault cases by a preponderance of evidence rather than hitting the bar of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that flies in the face of due process he argued and ultimately harms young mens future prospects whats going to result is a lot of young men and young women in this sea of hormones and alcohol that gets into so much trouble on campuses youre going to have charges of sexual assault he said and youre going to have young men disciplined their lives often permanently and seriously blighted by this — dont get into medical school dont get to law school all the rest four democratic senators reached out to will after his column was published to torch the conservative columnists ancient beliefs will said he wrote a letter back to the senators and laid out his rebuttal in the cspan interview what i say is that a i take sexual assault more seriously than i think they do because i agree that society has correctly said that rape is second only to murder as a serious felony will said and therefore when someone is accused of rape it should be reported to the criminal justice system that knows how to deal with this not jerrybuilt improvised campus processes second i take i think sexual assault somewhat more seriously than the senators do because i think theres a danger now of defining sexual assault so broadly so capaciously that it begins to trivialize the seriousness of it he added when remarks become sexual assault improper touching — bad shouldnt be done but its not sexual assault well we cant have young mens lives blighted by rape charges much better for young women to just suck it up and deal

keflezighi philip stoll public ignorance rita jeptoo tyrannosaurus rex 37 comments good morning just because i feel like it im going to avoid the depressing news today and give you a mixture of stories that interested me by now everyone knows about the 15 or 16yearold boy who on sunday flew from california to hawaii in the wheel well of a boeing 767 jet and survived it turns out he ran away from home after some kind of argument climbed over a fence at san jose mineta international airport and hid in the wheel well of the first plane he saw authorities are trying to figure out how he evaded multiple layers of security and how he survived a trip that could have killed him from abc news he got very lucky that he got to go to maui but he was not targeting maui as a destination simon said the boy is also lucky to be alive given that wheelwell stowaways rarely surviving flight conditions at 38000 feet the percentage of oxygen is a fraction of that at sea level and the temperature ranges from minus50 to minus85 degrees the plane landed in hawaii about an hour later at 1020 am hawaii time crews were startled by the teen coming out of the wheel well maui airports district manager marvin moniz said he was weak he hung from the wheel valve and then he fell to the ground and regained some strength moniz said the daily mail has more he passed out in the air and didnt regain consciousness until an hour after the plane landed in hawaii simon said when he came to he climbed out of the wheel well and was immediately seen by airport personnel who escorted him inside where he was interviewed by the fbi simon said it was not immediately clear how the boy stayed alive in the unpressurized space where temperatures at cruising altitude can fall well below zero and the air is too thin for humans to stay conscious an faa study of stowaways found that some survive by going into a hibernationlike state according to simon the boy doesnt have any memories of the flight some experts are questioning whether the story is even true news of the incident was met with suspicion and scrutiny most wheelwell stowaways dont survive falling victim to frigid temperatures and lack of oxygen the chances of survival of a wheelwell stowaway on a commercial aircraft are about 24 percent according to the federal aviation administrations civil aerospace medical institute abc news aviation consultant john nance is skeptical that the teen could have survived the 2300mile flight in the wheel well without an oxygen source i just dont believe it nance said dr richard besser abc news chief health and medical editor said in order to survive inside a wheel well during a flight the body has to fall into a hibernationlike state with the heart only beating a couple times a minute its near impossible almost miraculous and maybe theres more to the story besser said besides how did this kid manage to evade security including multiple layers of security including wideranging video surveillance german shepherds and segwayriding police officers back to the daily mail san jose international airport spokeswoman rosemary barnes says airport employees monitor security video feeds from throughout the 1050acre airport around the clock however she said no one noticed images of an unidentified person walking on the airport ramp and approaching hawaiian airlines flight 45 in the dark until security agents reviewed the footage after the plane had landed in hawaii and the boy had been found the airport in the heart of silicon valley is surrounded by fences although some sections do not have barbed wire and could easily be scaled the boy found his way onto the tarmac during the night under the cover of darkness barnes said hours later surveillance video at kahului airport showed the boy getting out of the wheel well after landing according to a statement from hawaiis department of transportation the boy isnt being charged with a crime and will be returned to his parents where hell have a quite a story to tell i guess well learn more in the next few days yesterdays boston marathon came off without a hitch and an american won the mens race for the first time in more than 30 years the new york daily news reports american meb keflezighi wins boston marathon a year after bombing with the names of the murdered written on his runners bib american meb keflezighi raced to victory monday in the boston marathon becoming a living symbol of resilience from the dark days of terror keflezighi 38 a member of the new york athletic club said his triumph was fueled by a city that refused to buckle in the face of hate it was not about me it was about boston strong said keflezighi who broke down in tears as he became the first american in 31 years to win the race when the bomb exploded every day since ive wanted to come back and win it the eritreaborn keflezighi who became an american citizen in 1998 crossed the finish line to chants of usa a mere 11 seconds in front of kenyas wilson chebet he won the elite mens race with a time of 20837 a personal best and the secondfastest for an american man at boston when the red sox won the world series and put the trophy right there he said pointing to the boylston st finish line i wanted to win it for the people of boston keflezighi came to the us with his parents when he was 12 years old he attended public schools in san diego where he first started running he graduated from ucla where he won multiple championships and awards he won a silver medal in the 2004 olympics and in 2009 he became the first american man to win the new york city marathon since 1982 in the womens race 2013 winner rita jeptoo won again setting a course record of 21857–also a personal best jeptoo is from kenya i guess this next story is a little bit depressing but its mostly ridiculous from upi majority of americans doubt the big bang theory in a new national poll on americas scientific acumen more than half of respondents said they were not too confident or not at all confident that the universe began 138 billion years ago with a big bang the poll was conducted by gfk public affairs corporate communications scientists were apparently dismayed by this news which arrives only a few weeks after astrophysicists located the first hard evidence of cosmic inflation but when compared to results from other science knowledge surveys 51 percent isnt too shameful — or surprising other polls on americas scientific beliefs have arrived at similar findings the science and engineering indicators survey — which the national science foundation has conducted every year since the early 1980s — has consistently found only about a third of americans believe that the universe began with a huge explosion okay maybe the notion of a giant explosion setting the universe in motion is a little surprising but its certainly more believable than the biblical explanation that a godly being created the universe in seven days by making pronouncements like let there be light now an example of what some people are willing to believe has the loch ness monster been spotted on apple maps members of the official loch ness monster fan club claim they have studied an image seen on apples global satellite map application that shows the allegedly 100footlong creature cnet com reports citing londons daily mail they say if you zoom in on apple images from space you can even see the monsters giant flippers news of the sighting has fans of nessie — as shes affectionately called — buzzing because there hasnt been a loch ness sighting in 18 months legend has it shes been cruising the area of loch just south of dores scotland for some 90 years but so far theres no definitive proof she exists nessies fan club devotees say they have ruled out all other possibilities for the grainy image including a floating log or a giant seal but one skeptic deepsea biologist andrew david thaler debunks the theory on his website southernfriedsciencecom saying that the image shows the wake of a boat i have a few more interesting science stories for you from national geographic the tragic story of how einsteins brain was stolen and wasnt even special my headline may be a bit misleading albert einstein the nobel prizewinning physicist who gave the world the theory of relativity e mc 2 and the law of the photoelectric effect obviously had a special brain so special that when he died in princeton hospital on april 17 1955 the pathologist on call thomas harvey stole it einstein didnt want his brain or body to be studied he didnt want to be worshipped he had left behind specific instructions regarding his remains cremate them and scatter the ashes secretly in order to discourage idolaters writes brian burrell in his 2005 book postcards from the brain museum but harvey took the brain anyway without permission from einstein or his family when the fact came to light a few days later harvey managed to solicit a reluctant and retroactive blessing from einsteins son hans albert with the nowfamiliar stipulation that any investigation would be conducted solely in the interest of science burrell writes this story is so weird that there is no way i can do it justice with excerpts you need to read the whole thing just to whet your appetite ill tell you that beat writer william burroughs makes a cameo appearance the comments are interesting too part of a mastodon tooth i just love this story its the kind of thing i dreamed would happen to me when i was a kid 9yearold michigan boy unearths 10000yearold mastodon tooth near home i was walking down at the creek last summer i felt something that i stepped on so i picked it up and everybody in the neighborhood thought it was pretty cool philip stoll told cnn on friday it felt weird he said according to the detroit free press i had to see what it was i pulled it out and brought it to my mom stolltook the sixpeaked 8inch foreign object to his windsor township house and washed it in his kitchen sink to get a better look mom heidi stoll was also brought in for consultation i didnt even think that it could have been a tooth until i started checking online for some kind of match she said we saw a picture of a mastodon tooth and said there it is the stoll family eventually reached out to james harding a herpetologist – an expert on reptiles and amphibians at nearby michigan state who confirmed their suspicions this is indeed a mastodon tooth professor harding verified in an email cnn reports apparently it is the upper surface broken off at the roots wow that is one lucky kid philip told cnn he has dreamed of becoming a paleontologist when he grows up did you hear about how the smithsonian acquired a nearlycomplete skeleton of a tyranosaurus rex and had it delivered from montana by fedex from the guardian rare t rex bones arrive at smithsonian museum after crosscountry journey for the first time since its dinosaur hall opened in 1911 the smithsonians national museum of natural history will have a nearly complete t rex skeleton fedex delivered the dinosaur bones in a truck carrying 16 carefully packed crates the t rex discovered in 1988 on federal land in montana is about 8085 complete its one of about half a dozen nearly complete t rex skeletons that have been uncovered this specimen could become the most prominent with its new home in one of the worlds mostvisited museums about 7 million people visit the natural history museum each year and it offers free admission like the mastodon tooth that philip stoll found this skeleton was discovered by amateurs kathy wankel a montana rancher who discovered the bones in 1998 during a camping trip said she was proud to see the specimen in a national museum initially wankel spotted about 3 inches of bone sticking out of the ground and she and her husband dug out a small arm bone we were so thrilled we had found a bone we called that a mega find she said at the museum but i think now this is a mega find paleontologists from the museum of the rockies in bozeman mont excavated the fossil and its been housed there for the past 25 years at the smithsonian the skeleton will be mounted upright for the first time those are my offbeat offerings for today what stories have you been following please feel free to post real news in the comments did you like this post please

that is real but seems surreal like a film that should have been directed by david lynch inside the mind of a mass murderer in drag – amanpour – cnncom blogs how do we know what is in the mind of a mass murderer how about getting them to reenact those crimes that is exactly what documentary filmmaker joshua oppenheimer did with several men who participated in mass killings in indonesia decades ago its tempting to look at them through the lens of sort of fiction storytelling where you have good guys and bad guys good guys and then cackling villains oppenheimer told cnns hala gorani sitting in for christiane amanpour on monday when youre a nonfiction filmmaker you have to look at the real people you meet just look at this image from the movie to his surprise and horror they were enthusiastic they agreed to make a movie about how they killed and allowed him to film the process the result is a mindbending movie within a documentary by turns emotionally revolting beautiful and bizarre – one of the mass killers appears as often as not in drag it is rarely entirely clear what is acting and what is genuine alright moving on while on the subject of film here is a reminder watch pygmalion 1939 – staring leslie howard on sunday february 23rd at 1215 am est it is fantastic decades before the 1964 musical my fair lady swept the academy awards® the author of pygmalion the play on which it was based became a most unlikely oscar® winner for the originals 1938 screen adaptation possibly the most intelligent person to win the award he might have claimed to be the only intelligent man to do so shaw holds the distinction of being the only individual to win both an academy award® and the nobel prize for literature given his disdain for the movies particularly those adapted from his own plays its a minor miracle the film even got made and turned out to be a brilliant adaptation the story of a phonetics professor modeled on reallife phonetician henry sweet who turns a cockney flower girl into a lady by teaching her to speak properly touched a chord with audiences who viewed it as one of the writers most romantic plays it had already been filmed twice in germany in 1935 and in the netherlands in 1937 shaw had disliked those versions so much that when producer gabriel pascal first approached him about filming an english version the writer turned him down only when pascal promised not to change a word and agreed to cast wendy hiller whom shaw had admired in stage productions of pygmalion and st joan did the great writer accede although she had already made one film the lowbudget 1937 comedy lancashire luck pascal gave her introductory billing in pygmalion at shaws request the author did not get his way in casting the male lead however his first choice for henry higgins was charles laughton but pascal convinced him that leslie howard would make the film more marketable in the us that choice may not have been based solely on the stars boxoffice appeal in the mid30s laughton was riding high on a series of popular films including ruggles of red gap and mutiny on the bounty both 1935 rather pascal may have been appealing to the popular notion that the leading characters eventually married shaw had resisted the notion and even wrote a 1916 essay describing elizas life after parting ways with higgins and decrying the more sentimental interpretations as lazy dependence on the readymades and reachmedowns of the ragshop in which romance keeps its stock of happy endings to misfit all stories with the more romantic howard cast as higgins however pascal may have hoped to weight the story towards a more romantic interpretation that would have sold more tickets one way pascal got around shaws insistence on a wordforword filming of the play was by hiring him to write the screenplay that gave the author a chance to incorporate scenes cut from most stage productions because they would have added too many sets shaw even had said such scenes were best suited to a film version the writer also got to expand the scene at the embassy ball where higgins wins his bet to pass eliza off as a lady as a result shaw agreed to cut some of the plays more philosophical speeches including several of the longer speeches delivered by elizas father he also grudgingly agreed to include a final scene in which eliza returns to higgins who unable to express his love for her demands where the devil are my slippers eliza shaw would later disavow this ending insisting that eliza instead married her high society admirer freddie eynsfordhill bottom line is shaw loved this film version at years end it was nominated for four academy awards® — including best picture best actor howard and best actress hiller — years before foreign films were regularly honored at the oscars® it won for shaws screenplay but the author was hardly grateful instead he announced its an insult for them to offer me any honor as if they had never heard of me — and its very likely they never have they might as well send an honor to george for being king of england his private views may have been more appreciative mary pickford would later report that when she visited shaw the award was prominently displayed on his mantelpiece when novelist lloyd c douglas announced pygmalion had won best screenplay he quipped mr shaws story now is as original as it was three thousand years ago but though shaw had indeed been inspired by the greek myth about a sculptor who falls in love with his female statue his version of the story became as much a part of popular culture as the original legend please stay up and watch it you will not be disappointed okay now a quick link to some eyecandy anna sui fall 2014 collection tom lorenzo fabulous opinionated a sad

a rainbow wig she was arrested while walking to her seat at an olympic hockey game the rainbow is now legally suspect in russia since the passage last year of a draconian antigay law that bans what the russians call gay propaganda in reality the law bans anything – speech clothing or actions – that might give the impression that being gay is okay for example the flag of russias autonomous jewish region came under scrutiny from moscow because it contains a rainbow and a newspaper editor was recently fined threemonths pay for quoting a gay person in a news story in which the gay person defended

house approves higher debt limit without condition – nytimescom ending three years of brinkmanship in which the threat of a devastating default on the nations debt was used to wring conservative concessions from president obama the house on tuesday voted to raise the governments borrowing limit until march 2015 without any conditions the vote — 221 to 201 — relied almost entirely on democrats in the republicancontrolled house to carry the measure and represented the first debt ceiling increase since 2009 that was not attached to other legislation only 28 republicans voted yes and only two democrats voted no i guess you could say hell froze over simply by holding the vote speaker john a boehner of ohio effectively ended a threeyear tea partyinspired era of budget showdowns that had raised the threat of default and government shutdowns rattled economic confidence and brought serious scrutiny from other nations questioning washingtons ability to govern in the process though mr boehner also set off a series of reprisals from fellow republican congressmen and outside groups that showcased the partys deep internal divisions he gave the president exactly what he wanted which is exactly what the republican party said we did not want said a republican representative tim huelskamp of kansas who last year unsuccessfully tried to rally enough support to derail mr boehners reelection as speaker its going to really demoralize the base the nyt article goes on to say it was a victory for the president and the demsbut considering the shit we have dealt with the last few years and those poor people who will be dealing with lower food stamp funds how can that be a victory meanwhile in west virginia another spill is causing the citizens grief significant slurry spill

chesapeake this has had significant adverse environmental impact to fields creek and an unknown amount of impact to the kanawha river said secretary randy huffman of the state department of

jacksons face at the end it really does show how tired he is of all the shit i noticed yesterday yall were talking in the comments about books you were reading i just started to read this one about cuss words as discussed in this link here heres the first recorded instance of the fword in english and its a monk expressing his displeasure at an abbot in the margins of a guide to moral conduct because of course scumbag sounds like the kind of hokey insult that would get you laughed at if you used it when it was used in a new york times it got read technically fuck appeared two times before this in 1500 it was used in a satirical poem to describe some friars in that case nothing like fuck was actually written out instead the word was hidden in a code and in 1513 it appeared in a scottish poem as fukkit but for englishs first use weve got a dissatisfied 1528 monk hes written o d fuckin abbot melissa mohr author of holy sht a brief history of swearing says this fuck could be either literal or metaphorical it is difficult to know whether the annotator intended fucking to mean having sex as in that guy is doing too much fucking for someone who is supposed to be celibate or whether he used it as an intensifier to convey his extreme dismay if the latter it anticipates the first recorded use by more than three hundred years either is possible really—john burton the abbot in question was a man of questionable monastic morals so either this monk was recording his abbots sex life or he was the first person to be so angry that only fuck could convey its scope did you all see

Please post your thoughts and links in the comment thread.\n\nSo if you bought into the “cave man diet” AKA “Paleolithic diet” recommendations, you were scammed. These early Neanderthals even cooked vegetables and may have used plants for medicinal purposes. Read the whole article at the link. It’s fascinating.\n\nMs Sistiaga and her colleagues collected a number of samples from the remnants of a 50,000-year-old campfire in the El Salt dig site, a known Neanderthal habitation near Alicante on Spain’s Mediterranean coast.\n\nPoo is “the perfect evidence,” said Ms Ainara Sistiaga, a PhD student at the University of La Laguna on the Canary Islands, and the study’s first author, “because you’re sure it was consumed”.\n\nThe new paper, in the journal  PLOS One , claims to offer the best support to date for an omnivorous diet.\n\nAn earlier view of these early humans as purely meat-eating has already been partially discredited by plant remains found in their caves and teeth.\n\nFound at a dig in Spain, the ancient excrement showed chemical traces of both meat and plant digestion.\n\nThis study was done to determine the remaining colloids amounts in groundwater when the above soil got exposed to flowback fliud in a hydrofracking spills.\n\nThis study was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society and was conducted by the researchers at the Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.\n\nIn this study, flowback fluid from hydraulic fracturing was analyzed. Colloids are the charged particles and larger than molecules and have the potency to bind to sand grains. With the wastewater, colloids get released in to the ground water.\n\nAccording to a new research, wastewater contains substances that bind to pollutants and their release in soil leads to the ground water contamination as they get along with the water when it is soaked by earth.\n\nGee, do you suppose it could have anything to do with fracking? And what about all that wastewater that has to be disposed of in the fracking process? From Techsonia:  Fracking Fluid Spills release Colloids that Pollute Groundwater .\n\nNow after years of being harangued by anxious residents, governments in all three states are confronting the issue, reviewing scientific data, holding public discussions and considering new regulations. Thursday’s meeting in Oklahoma will include the state agency that regulates oil and gas drilling and the Oklahoma Geological Survey.\n\nOklahoma recorded nearly 150 between January and the start of May. Though most have been too weak to cause serious damage or endanger lives, they’ve raised suspicions that the shaking might be connected to the oil and gas drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing, especially the wells in which the industry disposes of its wastewater.\n\nEarthquakes used to be almost unheard of on the vast stretches of prairie that unfold across Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma, but they’ve become common in recent years.\n\nHundreds of people are expected to turn out in Edmond, Oklahoma, on Thursday night for a town hall meeting on the issue.\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Oklahoma residents whose homes and nerves have been shaken by an upsurge in earthquakes want to know what’s causing the temblors — and what can be done to stop them.\n\nabout why their state has been having so many earthquakes all of a sudden, according to the Globe-Gazzette.com.\n\nJust as important, a win would mean that the Americans have defeated one of soccer’s oligarchs at a World Cup, with both sides trying their best for a victory. That by itself would be a precedent-setting result.\n\nBefore the tournament, most people thought it would be an unlikely success for the U.S. just to get out of the so-called Group of Death and to the Round of 16. Now, after beating Ghana and dominating much of the game against Portugal, the U.S. can dream bigger. Beat Germany, and America wins its group for the second straight World Cup, a result nearly unthinkable when the draw was announced in December. Beat Germany, and the U.S. secures a favorable Round of 16 match most likely against Algeria or Russia, rather than a trickier faceoff with sneaky-good Belgium.\n\nAll the focus on permutations and goal-differential scenarios has undercut the importance of today’s game for American soccer. There’s not as much at stake, goes the implication, because we can move ahead even if we lose to Germany. But this is about more than getting to the next round. This is an opportunity for the U.S. to face one of soccer’s elite teams on the biggest stage and prove it can hang with—even beat—any country in this World Cup.\n\nIn the wake of the U.S. team’s  heartbreaking come-from-ahead draw  against Portugal in the World Cup on Sunday, soccer analysts and Twitter users scrambled to figure out the many ways the U.S. can still get to the next round. With a three-point lead over Portugal and Ghana in Group G, the Americans can advance even if they lose their match against Germany at noon Eastern today, depending on the outcome of the Portugal-Ghana game played at the same time. Deadspin has one of the better  graphical breakdown s of every potential scenario for the U.S., including the dreaded  drawing of lots .\n\n“By the way, you should act like a good leader and take the day off as well. Go USA! Signed Jurgen Klinsmann, Head Coach, U.S. National team”.\n\n“The #USMNT (U.S. Men’s National Team) has a critical World Cup game vs Germany and we will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round.\n\n“I understand that this absence may reduce the productivity of your workplace, but I can assure you that it is for an important cause,” wrote Klinsmann.\n\nThe letter was distributed on social networks by the U.S. Soccer.\n\nIn the style of a ‘doctor’s note’, Klinsmann addresses employers and asks them to forgive their staff for their absence.\n\nKlinsman suggested that U.S. fans should take a day off work to watch the game, and wrote a letter to bosses asking them to excuse their employee’s absences, reports Reuters.\n\n“I think some people might be a little bit surprised at our results so far,” coach Jurgen Klinsmann said Wednesday. “We are by no means any underdog here in this tournament, but we know it’s the biggest hurdle we have to take now with Germany.”\n\nTeam USA began their World Cup run in the so-called “group of death,” but their aggression, attacks and overall stamina on the pitch have defied pundits who originally dismissed their chances of advancing.\n\n“This is the biggest game of a lot of our lives, so any fatigue in our legs will be erased,” said American midfielder Kyle Beckerman. “We’ve got to give everything we’ve got and more.”\n\nPlayers spent the three days between matches recovering and regrouping after a  physical first game against Ghana  and an  emotional tie against Portugal .\n\nTeam USA was greeted with cheers from American fans Wednesday as they arrived in the Brazilian city of Recife.\n\nIt’s been a roller coaster ride for the American team so far in the  World Cup . The team that, on paper, many pundits didn’t expect to advance, now has a real shot at moving on to the second round. And as CBS News’ Elaine Quijano reports, that fate is hinged on beating or at least coming up even against one of the cup favorites, Germany.\n\n“A number of states, including my home state of Maine, have now legalized same-sex marriage, and I agree with that decision,” Collins said in a statement, adding later: “I have long opposed efforts to impose a federal ban on same-sex marriage. In both 2004 and 2006, I voted against amendments to the United States Constitution that would have banned same-sex marriages by preempting state laws.”\n\nIn another breakthrough, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine has announced that she supports same-sex marriage. From The Washington Post:\n\n“The Indiana ruling invalidating its ban today also used similar reasoning,” Tobias says. “All courts are finding that the bans violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th amendment.”\n\n“The 4th Circuit [in Virginia] may well apply the reasoning of the 10th Circuit opinion, as will numerous district courts that have yet to rule,” he says.\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, writes NPR in an email that the Utah decision “is very significant, as [it is] the first appellate court to address the marriage equality issue.\n\nBoth decisions are significant in that they may influence decisions in other states.\n\nIn Indiana, Young wrote: “Same-sex couples, who would otherwise qualify to marry in Indiana, have the right to marry in Indiana. … These couples, when gender and sexual orientation are taken away, are in all respects like the family down the street. The Constitution demands that we treat them as such.”\n\n“It is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples,” the three-judge panel in the Utah case said. The panel immediately put the ruling on hold pending its appeal, either to the entire 10th Circuit or directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, according to The Associated Press.\n\nIn Utah, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld a lower court ruling striking down the state’s gay-marriage ban. And in Indiana, U.S. District Judge Richard Young  made a similar ruling.\n\nUtah and  Indiana  are the latest states to see their bans on same-sex marriage struck down by a federal court, following rulings in both states Wednesday that found the prohibition unconstitutional.\n\nThere was exciting news yesterday in the struggle to legalize same-sex marriage state by state.\n\nThe seafloor search, he said, should start around August and be completed within one year. The area is 58 miles wide and 400 miles long, covering an area as big as Lake Huron, the second-largest of the U.S. Great Lakes. By comparison, the area searched with a robotic, sonar-equipped submarine in May was about 330 square miles.\n\nAustralia Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the search was continuing with a mapping of the ocean floor in the newly defined area, to be followed by a comprehensive seafloor search.\n\nThe new zone, about 1,100 miles west of Perth, Australia, is farther south than where previous intensive search efforts were carried out this spring after the plane vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard. The flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it went missing….\n\nExperts from Boeing and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board were among the specialists who helped define the zone, based on satellite data and analysis of previous similar incidents.\n\nBased on the report, a new search zone has been designated, according to the LA Times:\n\n“Given these observations, the final stages of the unresponsive crew/hypoxia event type appeared to best fit the available evidence for the final period of MH370’s flight when it was heading in a generally southerly direction,” the document said.\n\nEvidence for an unresponsive crew as the plane flew south includes the loss of radio communications, a long period with no maneuvering of the aircraft, a steadily maintained cruise altitude and eventual fuel exhaustion and descent, the report said.\n\nPilots are trained to put on oxygen masks immediately if an aircraft suffers depressurization; their masks have an hour’s air supply, compared with only a few minutes for the passengers. The plane, which left Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, bound for Beijing, with 239 people aboard, made its turn south toward the Indian Ocean about an hour after it stopped responding to air-traffic controllers….\n\nHypoxia occurs when a plane loses air pressure and the pilots, lacking adequate oxygen, become confused and incapable of performing even basic manual tasks.\n\nA report issued by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, outlining how the new search zone had been chosen, said that the most likely scenario as the aircraft headed south across the Indian Ocean on March 8 was that the crew was suffering from hypoxia or was otherwise unresponsive.\n\nBut exactly why the autopilot would have been set on a flight path so far off course from the jet’s destination of Beijing, and exactly when it was switched on remains unknown.\n\nAsked whether the autopilot would have to be manually switched on, or whether it could have been activated automatically under a default setting, Dolan replied, “The basic assumption would be that if the autopilot is operational it’s because it’s been switched on.”\n\n“Certainly for its path across the Indian Ocean, we are confident that the aircraft was operating on autopilot until it ran out of fuel,” Dolan told reporters in Canberra, the nation’s capital.\n\nAfter analyzing data exchanged between the plane and a satellite, officials believe Flight 370 was on autopilot the entire time it was flying across a vast expanse of the southern Indian Ocean, based on the straight path it took, Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Martin Dolan said.\n\nSYDNEY, Australia — Investigators looking into the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines plane are confident it was on autopilot when it crashed in a remote stretch of the Indian Ocean, Australian officials said Thursday as they announced the latest shift in the search for the jet.\n\nWolf Blitzer must be celebrating this morning, because the mystery plane is back in the headlines.\n\nThere has also been an increase in a condition called colony collapse disorder (CCD) in which there is a rapid, unexpected and catastrophic loss of bees in a hive.\n\nThe decline in bee populations is also blamed on the loss of natural forage and inadequate diets, mite infestations and diseases.\n\nHoney bees add more than $15bn in value to US agricultural crops, according to the White House.\n\nBee populations saw a 23% decline last winter, a trend blamed on the loss of genetic diversity, exposure to certain pesticides and other factors.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the agriculture department will lead the effort, which includes $8m (£4.7m) for new honey bee habitats.\n\nKaling isn’t alone. Women are woefully under-represented in the technology industry. Only about 20 percent of software developers in the US are women, according to the Labor Department. Last month, even  Google admitted only 17 percent of its tech workers are women .\n\n“People my age have a million ideas for apps,” she said. “But we have no idea how to build them. Last week in the movies, I didn’t even know how to turn off the flashlight on my phone.”\n\nKaling, who emceed the event, said she has tons of ideas for apps but no idea to how make them work. She said she’d like to create a “What’s his deal?” app that takes a picture of guy and tells you whether he’s single, married, a weirdo, or what his  car  is like. Another idea is a Shazaam-like app for perfume.\n\nThursday night the company kicked off the  Made with Code initiative  here with celebrities former first daughter Chelsea Clinton and actress and comedienne Mindy Kaling.\n\nGoogle wants to see more women in technology, and it’s funding a $50 million initiative to encourage girls to learn how to code in an effort to close the gender gap.\n\nThis sounds like it could do some good:  Google commits $50M to encouraging girls to code  (CNet)\n\nNow go read the rest at the link. You won’t be sorry.\n\nHush now, let Gentleman George condescend to speak down to you and try, fruitlessly no doubt, to explain once again that  rape is what George Will says rape is …\n\nt seems that, after explaining  the ins and out of rape  to you ungrateful curs, he was shocked and dismayed to discover that you promiscuous info-trollops on the intertubes are unable to comprehend the pearls of wisdom that he dispenses to the riff-raff gratis, courtesy of Ye Olde Washminster Poste.\n\nOh yes, he most certainly can, you loathsome wastrel.\n\nAnd especially you. Don’t think by closing your laptop he can’t see you, because he can.\n\nVictorian gas-pipe and Her Majesty’s Curator of Rape To The Colonies, George Will, has just about had it up to here with you people — YES, YOU PEOPLE.\n\nWhatever you do, don’t miss this TBogg post at Raw Story:  Gentleman George Will is getting damned tired of having to explain rape to you guttersnipes .\n\nWell, we can’t have young men’s lives “blighted” by rape charges. Much better for young women to just suck it up and deal with a years of post-traumatic stress on their own and keep their complaints to themselves.\n\n“Second, I take, I think, sexual assault somewhat more seriously than the senators do because I think there’s a danger now of defining sexual assault so broadly, so capaciously, that it begins to trivialize the seriousness of it,” he added. “When remarks become sexual assault, improper touching — bad, shouldn’t be done, but it’s not sexual assault.”\n\n“What I say is that: A) I take sexual assault more seriously than I think they do, because I agree that society has correctly said that rape is second only to murder as a serious felony,” Will said. “And therefore, when someone is accused of rape, it should be reported to the criminal justice system that knows how to deal with this, not jerry-built, improvised campus processes.”\n\nFour Democratic senators  reached out to Will  after his column was published to torch the conservative columnist’s “ancient beliefs.” Will said he wrote a letter back to the senators and laid out his rebuttal in the C-SPAN interview.\n\n“What’s going to result is a lot of young men and young women in this sea of hormones and alcohol, that gets into so much trouble on campuses, you’re going to have charges of sexual assault,” he said. “And you’re going to have young men disciplined, their lives often permanently and seriously blighted by this — don’t get into medical school, don’t get to law school, all the rest.”\n\nWill explained that he took issue with the practice of adjudicating campus sexual assault cases by a “preponderance” of evidence, rather than hitting the bar of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. That flies in the face of due process, he argued, and ultimately harms young men’s future prospects.\n\nIn other words, while Congress’s unpopularity alone can’t sink any given member in a primary, it has established a higher baseline of distrust that challengers can build on when incumbents are otherwise vulnerable. And as the sitting House Majority Leader, Cantor was uniquely susceptible to voters’ frustration with Congress as an institution.\n\nOverall, 32 House incumbents have taken less than 75 percent of the vote in their primaries so far this year, up from 31 at this point in 2010 and just 12 at this point in 2006. What’s more, 27 of these 32 “underperforming” incumbents have been Republicans.\n\nCantor was only the second House incumbent to lose a primary this year (the first was Texas Republican Ralph Hall), but the warning signs of discontent were abundant: Plenty of rank-and-file House incumbents had been receiving startlingly low primary vote shares against weak and under-funded opponents, including GOP Reps. Rodney Davis of Illinois, Lee Terry of Nebraska and David Joyce of Ohio. In fact, just a week before Cantor’s defeat and without much fanfare, socially moderate Rep. Leonard Lance of New Jersey received just 54 percent of the Republican primary vote against the same tea party-backed opponent he had taken 61 percent against in 2012.\n\nAt FiveThirtyEightPolitics, David Wasserman has a long article on “What we can learn from Eric Cantor’s defeat .” You really need to read the whole thing, but here’s a small excerpt that deals with the contribution of public distrust of Congress:\n\nNow Christie and Walker are  implicated in criminal investigations . Prosecutors in Wisconsin placed Walker at the center of a “criminal scheme” to coordinate campaign spending with outside groups. In New Jersey, the investigation stemming from the George Washington Bridge scandal is reportedly closing in on Christie himself. For both men, once considered potential saviors of the GOP, the political future looks considerably dimmer.\n\nYesterday’s news that Scott Walker and Chris Christie sinking deeper into their respective scandals is as good a sign as any of the GOP’s political disintegration. After Obama crushed Mitt Romney in 2012, Republicans began casting about for their 2016 redeemer, and Christie and Walker were high on the list. They won conservative hearts with their antagonism toward unions, but they had also found a way to win in reliably Democratic states. If the GOP hoped to take on candidate-in-waiting Hillary Clinton, they’d need someone who could peel away some Democratic voters. Walker had  talked about  the need to nominate an “outsider” like himself in 2016.\n\nIt’s fashionable right now to talk about the  premature end of Barack Obama’s presidency . He’s fast approaching the second half of his second term, which is historically the beginning of lame-duck season. His poll numbers aren’t what anyone would call ideal, and Republicans (in concert with some excitable members of the press) are rushing to proclaim the Obama presidency dead. “I saw a commentator today say that these polls, what they reflect, is that the Obama presidency is over,” Sen. Marco Rubio  said , referring to NBC’s Chuck Todd. “And I agree with that. I think it is, in general.” Speaker John Boehner told reporters at his  weekly press briefing  yesterday: “You look at this presidency and you can’t help but get the sense that the wheels are coming off.” ….The funny thing is that as Republicans team up with pundits to chisel out Obama’s epitaph, the Republican Party itself is falling to pieces right before our eyes.\n\nAt Salon, Simon Malloy writes about the multiplying Republican scandals:  GOP’s sudden scandal-mania: Why criminal probes and infighting are taking over the party .\n\n“Can I believe the magic in your sighs?” Owens pointedly asks her paramour. In the bridge, Goffin’s words flow like champagne even as they fear the possible hangover: “Tonight with words unspoken/You’ll say that I’m the only one/But will my heart be broken/When the night meets the morning sun.” King’s melody plays a big role in the overall effect, arching high in the verses and middle eight while accompanied by strings that elegantly trip across the proceedings like moonlight dancers, before coming back down to Earth for the interrogative refrain.\n\nGoffin’s lyrics deftly touch on the doubt that lurks behind all new romances. As sung by Shirelles’ leader Shirley Owens in unflappable manner, the song doesn’t skimp on the wonder inherent in any fresh coupling. But it’s also unflinchingly realistic about the possibility that the fairy dust will dissolve at dawn.\n\nGoffin and King’s first hit was “Will You Love Me Tomorrow,” which they wrote in 1960 for the girl group the Shirelles. After the song hit #1 on the charts in 1961, Goffin quit his job as a chemist and began working full-time as a lyricist.\n\nIn addition to his wife, [Michelle] Mr. Goffin’s survivors include four daughters, Louise Goffin, Sherry Goffin Kondor, Dawn Reavis and Lauren Goffin; a son, Jesse Goffin; six grandchildren; and a brother, Al.\n\nAfter the couple divorced in 1968, King went on to become a singer and songwriter in her own right, although the two continued to collaborate and maintained a friendship. Goffin married again and and the couple had five children.\n\nHe asked her to help him write a musical. She was interested in rock ‘n’ roll. They hit it off anyway, and she was pregnant with their first child when they married on Aug. 30, 1959.\n\nHe graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School before enrolling at Queens College. He was three years older than Ms. King, studying chemistry, when they met in the spring of her freshman year.\n\nGerald Goffin was born on Feb. 11, 1939, in Brooklyn and grew up in Jamaica, Queens. He began writing lyrics as a boy — “like some kind of game in my head,” he recalled once — but found he was unable to come up with satisfying music to accompany them.\n\n“His words expressed what so many people were feeling but didn’t know how to say,” Ms. King said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe couple’s writing duties were clearly delineated: Ms. King composed the music, Mr. Goffin wrote the lyrics — among them some of the most memorable words in the history of popular music.\n\nTogether they composed a catalog of pop standards so diverse and irresistible that they were recorded by performers as unalike as the Drifters, Steve Lawrence, Aretha Franklin and the Beatles. They were inducted together into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. In 2004 the Recording Academy presented them jointly with a Trustees Award for lifetime achievement.\n\nMr. Goffin and Ms. King were students at Queens College when they met in 1958. Over the next decade they fell in love, married, had two children, divorced and moved their writing sessions into and out of 1650 Broadway, across the street from the  Brill Building . (The Brill Building pop music of the late 1950s and ‘60s was mostly written in both buildings.)\n\nMisleadingly, they are often called “Carole King songs”. She wrote the tunes, and later on she would sing them when, after Goffin and King divorced, she embarked on a hugely successful solo career. But whenever King sang her own, gentler versions of the  Chiffons’ One Fine Day  or the  Drifters’ Up on the Roof , she was still singing Goffin’s words. They were written by the man she had met when she was 17 and he was 20, and with whom she had two daughters while they lived in an apartment in the Queens housing project LeFrak City – and with whom she travelled to work in Manhattan every day at their cubicle in the offices of Aldon Music at 1650 Broadway, where they pumped out hit after hit after hit.\n\nBuried a little deeper in those wonderful songs are the lines that really touched his young listeners’ hearts. The words to the bridge, or middle section, of that first Shirelles hit from 1960 were almost like poetry: “Tonight with words unspoken/ You say that I’m the only one/ But will my heart be broken/ When the night meets the morning sun?” And when Goffin presented Aretha Franklin with the second verse of A Natural Woman – “When my soul was in the Lost and Found, you came along to claim it” – he gave countless ordinary lovers a way to express their deepest feelings.\n\nGerry Goffin, a trainee chemist who became the poet laureate of teenage pop, specialised in coming up with a great opening line to grab the audience’s attention. Plenty of people will remember the first time they heard “Tonight you’re mine completely/ You give your love so sweetly,” from  Will You Love Me Tomorrow , or “Looking out on the morning rain/ I used to feel so uninspired,” from  (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman . But he didn’t stop there.\n\nOn Thursday we lost another 1960s music great; Gerry Goffin, who wrote lyrics to Carole King’s music died at 75. The talented couple wrote the songs that accompanied my teenage years–so much great music associated with so many memories.\n\nThose are my offbeat offerings for today. What stories have you been following? Please feel free to post real news in the comments.\n\nPaleontologists from the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Mont., excavated the fossil, and it’s been housed there for the past 25 years. At the Smithsonian, the skeleton will be mounted upright for the first time.\n\n“We were so thrilled we had found a bone; we called that a mega find,” she said at the museum. “But I think now this is a mega find.”\n\nKathy Wankel, a Montana rancher who discovered the bones in 1998 during a camping trip, said she was proud to see the specimen in a national museum. Initially, Wankel spotted about 3 inches of bone sticking out of the ground, and she and her husband dug out a small arm bone.\n\nLike the mastodon tooth that Philip Stoll found, this skeleton was discovered by amateurs.\n\nThe T rex, discovered in 1988 on federal land in Montana, is about 80-85% complete. It’s one of about half a dozen nearly complete T rex skeletons that have been uncovered. This specimen could become the most prominent with its new home in one of the world’s most-visited museums. About 7 million people visit the natural history museum each year, and it offers free admission.\n\nFor the first time since its dinosaur hall opened in 1911, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History will have a nearly complete T rex skeleton. FedEx delivered the dinosaur bones in a truck carrying 16 carefully packed crates.\n\nDid you hear about how the Smithsonian acquired a nearly-complete skeleton of a Tyranosaurus Rex and had it delivered from Montana by FedEx? From the Guardian:  Rare T rex bones arrive at Smithsonian Museum after cross-country journey .\n\nWow, that is one lucky kid! Philip told CNN he has dreamed of becoming a paleontologist when he grows up.\n\n“This is indeed a mastodon tooth,” Professor Harding verified in an email, CNN reports. “Apparently (it is) the upper surface, broken off at the roots.”\n\nThe Stoll family eventually reached out to James Harding, a herpetologist – an expert on reptiles and amphibians, at nearby Michigan State, who confirmed their suspicions.\n\n“I didn’t even think that it could have been a tooth until I started checking online for some kind of match,” she said. “We saw a picture of a Mastodon tooth and said ‘there it is.'”\n\nStoll…took the six-peaked, 8-inch foreign object to his Windsor Township house and washed it in his kitchen sink to get a better look. Mom Heidi Stoll was also brought in for consultation.\n\n“It felt weird,” he said, according to the  Detroit Free Press . “I had to see what it was. I pulled it out and brought it to my mom.”\n\n“I was walking down at the creek last summer. I felt something that I stepped on so I picked it up and everybody in the neighborhood thought it was pretty cool,” Philip Stoll told  CNN  on Friday….\n\nI just love this story; it’s the kind of thing I dreamed would happen to me when I was a kid:  9-year-old Michigan Boy Unearths 10,000-Year-Old Mastodon Tooth near Home .\n\nThis story is so weird that there is no way I can do it justice with excerpts. You need to read the whole thing. Just to whet your appetite, I’ll tell you that Beat writer William Burroughs makes a cameo appearance. The comments are interesting too.\n\nBut Harvey took the brain anyway, without permission from Einstein or his family. “When the fact came to light a few days later, Harvey managed to solicit a reluctant and retroactive blessing from Einstein’s son, Hans Albert, with the now-familiar stipulation that any investigation would be conducted solely in the interest of science,”  Burrell writes .\n\nEinstein didn’t want his brain or body to be studied; he didn’t want to be worshipped. “He had left behind specific instructions regarding his remains: cremate them, and scatter the ashes secretly in order to discourage idolaters,” writes Brian Burrell in his 2005 book,  Postcards from the Brain Museum .\n\nMy headline may be a bit misleading. Albert Einstein, the Nobel prize-winning physicist who gave the world the theory of relativity,  E  =  mc 2 , and the law of the photoelectric effect, obviously had a special brain. So special that when he died in Princeton Hospital, on April 17, 1955, the pathologist on call, Thomas Harvey, stole it.\n\nFrom National Geographic:  The Tragic Story of How Einstein’s Brain Was Stolen and Wasn’t Even Special .\n\nNessie’s fan club devotees say they have ruled out all other possibilities for the grainy image, including a floating log or a giant seal. But one skeptic, deep-sea biologist Andrew David Thaler, debunks the theory on his website SouthernFriedScience.com , saying that the image shows the wake of a boat.\n\nNews of the sighting has fans of Nessie — as she’s affectionately called — buzzing because there hasn’t been a Loch Ness sighting in 18 months.  Legend has it she’s been cruising the area of Loch, just south of Dores, Scotland, for some 90 years, but so far, there’s no definitive proof she exists.\n\nMembers of the Official Loch Ness Monster Fan Club claim they have studied an image seen on Apple’s global satellite map application that shows the allegedly 100-foot-long creature,  CNet .com reports , citing  London’s Daily Mail.   They say if you zoom in on Apple images from space you can even see the monster’s giant flippers.\n\nNow an example of what some people are willing to believe:  Has the Loch Ness Monster been spotted on Apple Maps?\n\nOkay, maybe the notion of a giant explosion setting the universe in motion is a little surprising. But it’s certainly more believable than the biblical explanation that a godly being created the universe in seven days by making pronouncements like “Let there be light!”\n\nOther polls on America’s scientific beliefs have arrived at similar findings.  The “Science and Engineering Indicators” survey  — which the National Science Foundation has conducted every year since the early 1980s — has consistently found only about a third of Americans believe that “the universe began with a huge explosion.”\n\nBut when compared to results from other science knowledge surveys, 51 percent isn’t too shameful — or surprising.\n\nScientists were apparently dismayed by this news, which arrives only a few weeks after astrophysicists located the  first hard evidence of cosmic inflation .\n\nIn a new national poll on America’s scientific acumen, more than half of respondents said they were “not too confident” or “not at all confident” that “the universe began 13.8 billion years ago with a big bang.”\n\nI guess this next story is a little bit depressing, but it’s mostly ridiculous. From UPI:  Majority of Americans doubt the Big Bang theory .\n\nIn the women’s race, 2013 winner Rita Jeptoo won again , setting a course record of 2:18:57–also a personal best. Jeptoo is from Kenya.\n\nKeflezighi came to the U.S. with his parents when he was 12 years old. He attended public schools in San Diego, where he first started running. He graduated from UCLA, where he won multiple championships and awards. He won a silver medal in the 2004 Olympics, and in 2009 he became the first American man to win the New York City Marathon since 1982.\n\n“When the Red Sox won (the World Series) and put the trophy right there,” he said, pointing to the Boylston St. finish line, “I wanted to win it for the people of Boston.”\n\nThe Eritrea-born Keflezighi, who became an American citizen in 1998, crossed the finish line to chants of “U-S-A!” a mere 11 seconds in front of Kenya’s Wilson Chebet. He won the elite men’s race with a time of 2:08:37, a personal best and the second-fastest for an American man at Boston.\n\n“It was not about me. It was about Boston Strong,” said Keflezighi, who broke down in tears as he became the first American in 31 years to win the race. “When the bomb exploded, every day since I’ve wanted to come back and win it.”\n\nKeflezighi, 38, a member of the New York Athletic Club, said his triumph was fueled by a city that refused to buckle in the face of hate.\n\nWith the names of the murdered written on his runner’s bib, American Meb Keflezighi raced to victory Monday in the Boston Marathon, becoming a living symbol of resilience from the dark days of terror.\n\nYesterday’s Boston Marathon came off without a hitch, and an American won the men’s race for the first time in more than 30 years. The New York Daily News reports:  American Meb Keflezighi wins Boston Marathon a year after bombing .\n\nThe boy isn’t being charged with a crime, and will be returned to his parents, where he’ll have a quite a story to tell. I guess we’ll learn more in the next few days.\n\nHours later, surveillance video at Kahului Airport showed the boy getting out of the wheel well after landing, according to a statement from Hawaii’s Department of Transportation.\n\nThe boy found his way onto the tarmac during the night, ‘under the cover of darkness,’ Barnes said.\n\nThe airport, in the heart of Silicon Valley, is surrounded by fences, although some sections do not have barbed wire and could easily be scaled.\n\nSan Jose International Airport spokeswoman Rosemary Barnes says airport employees monitor security video feeds from throughout the 1,050-acre airport around the clock. However, she said no one noticed images of an unidentified person walking on the airport ramp and approaching Hawaiian Airlines Flight 45 in the dark until security agents reviewed the footage after the plane had landed in Hawaii and the boy had been found.\n\nBesides, how did this kid manage to evade security, including “multiple layers of security, including wide-ranging video surveillance, German shepherds and Segway-riding police officers?” Back to the Daily Mail:\n\n“It’s near impossible, almost miraculous, and maybe there’s more to the story,” Besser said.\n\nDr. Richard Besser, ABC News’ chief health and medical editor, said in order to survive inside a wheel well during a flight, the body has to fall into a hibernation-like state, with the heart only beating a couple times a minute.\n\nABC News aviation consultant John Nance is skeptical that the teen could have survived the 2,300-mile flight in the wheel well without an oxygen source.\n\nNews of the incident was met with suspicion and scrutiny. Most wheel-well stowaways don’t survive, falling victim to frigid temperatures and lack of oxygen. The chances of survival of a wheel-well stowaway on a commercial aircraft are about 24 percent, according to the Federal Aviation Administration’s Civil Aerospace Medical Institute.\n\nAccording to Simon, the boy doesn’t have any memories of the flight. Some experts are questioning whether the story is even true.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the boy stayed alive in the unpressurized space, where temperatures at cruising altitude can fall well below zero and the air is too thin for humans to stay conscious. An FAA study of stowaways found that some survive by going into a hibernation-like state.\n\nHe passed out in the air and didn’t regain consciousness until an hour after the plane landed in Hawaii, Simon said. When he came to, he climbed out of the wheel well and was immediately seen by airport personnel who escorted him inside where he was interviewed by the FBI, Simon said.\n\n“He was weak. He hung from the wheel valve and then he fell to the ground and regained some strength,” Moniz said.\n\nThe plane landed in Hawaii. About an hour later, at 10:20 a.m. Hawaii time, crews were startled by the teen coming out of the wheel well, Maui Airports District Manager Marvin Moniz said.\n\nThe boy is also lucky to be alive, given that wheel-well stowaways rarely surviving flight conditions. At 38,000 feet, the percentage of oxygen is a fraction of that at sea level, and the temperature ranges from minus-50 to minus-85 degrees….\n\n“He got very lucky that he got to go to Maui but he was not targeting Maui as a destination,” Simon said.\n\nIt turns out he ran away from home after some kind of argument, climbed over a fence at San Jose Mineta International Airport, and hid in the wheel well of the first plane he saw. Authorities are trying to figure out how he evaded multiple layers of security and how he survived a trip that could have killed him.\n\nBy now everyone knows about the 15- or 16-year-old boy who on Sunday flew from California to Hawaii in the wheel well of a Boeing 767 jet and survived.\n\nJust because I feel like it, I’m going to avoid the depressing news today and give you a mixture of stories that interested me.\n\nThat is all I’ve got today, share your thoughts and links below.\n\nFinally, this is real cool: SEE IT: California scuba divers interact with octopus who tries to take camera  – NY Daily News\n\nOh you got to go and check the place out.

And a newspaper editor was recently fined three-month’s pay for quoting a gay person in a news story in which the gay person defended themselves for having been fired based on their sexual orientation. And under similar legislation in St. Petersburg, a man was arrested for wearing rainbow suspenders .\n\nThe rainbow is now legally suspect in Russia since the passage last year of a draconian anti-gay law that bans what the Russians call “gay propaganda.” In reality, the law bans anything – speech, clothing or actions – that might give the impression that being gay is okay.\n\nLuxuria was wearing rainbow-colored clothing, and a rainbow wig.  She was arrested while walking to her seat at an Olympic hockey game.\n\nOlympic police today re-arrested former Italian member of parliament Vladimir Luxuria for wearing an outfit that was deemed a bit too “gay” for the Sochi Olympics.\n\nThe stories I have read about arrest out of Sochi are scary, what a disgusting display to the world.\n\n“They were put to the floor and beaten and physical force was used to them when they refused to be questioned without the presence of their lawyer, who was on his way to the police department,” Verzilov told reporters.\n\nEarlier in the day, band members Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were meeting with journalists when police detained them, according to Tolokonnikova’s husband, Petr Verzilov.

Douglas announced Pygmalion had won Best Screenplay, he quipped, “Mr. Shaw’s story now is as original as it was three thousand years ago.” But though Shaw had, indeed, been inspired by the Greek myth about a sculptor who falls in love with his female statue, his version of the story became as much a part of popular culture as the original legend.\n\nAt year’s end, it was nominated for four Academy Awards® — including Best Picture, Best Actor (Howard) and Best Actress (Hiller) — years before foreign films were regularly honored at the Oscars®. It won for Shaw’s screenplay, but the author was hardly grateful. Instead, he announced, “It’s an insult for them to offer me any honor, as if they had never heard of me — and it’s very likely they never have. They might as well send an honor to George for being King of England.” His private views may have been more appreciative. Mary Pickford would later report that when she visited Shaw the award was prominently displayed on his mantelpiece.\n\nOne way Pascal got around Shaw’s insistence on a word-for-word filming of the play was by hiring him to write the screenplay. That gave the author a chance to incorporate scenes cut from most stage productions because they would have added too many sets (Shaw even had said such scenes were best suited to a film version). The writer also got to expand the scene at the Embassy Ball, where Higgins wins his bet to pass Eliza off as a lady. As a result, Shaw agreed to cut some of the play’s more philosophical speeches, including several of the longer speeches delivered by Eliza’s father. He also grudgingly agreed to include a final scene in which Eliza returns to Higgins, who, unable to express his love for her, demands “Where the devil are my slippers, Eliza?” Shaw would later disavow this ending, insisting that Eliza instead married her high society admirer, Freddie Eynsford-Hill.\n\nThe author did not get his way in casting the male lead, however. His first choice for Henry Higgins was Charles Laughton, but Pascal convinced him that Leslie Howard would make the film more marketable in the U.S. That choice may not have been based solely on the stars’ box-office appeal. In the mid-’30s, Laughton was riding high on a series of popular films, including Ruggles of Red Gap and Mutiny on the Bounty (both 1935). Rather, Pascal may have been appealing to the popular notion that the leading characters eventually married. Shaw had resisted the notion and even wrote a 1916 essay describing Eliza’s life after parting ways with Higgins and decrying the more sentimental interpretations as “lazy dependence on the ready-mades and reach-me-downs of the ragshop in which Romance keeps its stock of ‘happy endings’ to misfit all stories.” With the more romantic Howard cast as Higgins, however, Pascal may have hoped to weight the story towards a more romantic interpretation that would have sold more tickets.\n\nThe story of a phonetics professor (modeled on real-life phonetician Henry Sweet) who turns a Cockney flower girl into a lady by teaching her to speak properly touched a chord with audiences, who viewed it as one of the writer’s most romantic plays. It had already been filmed twice, in Germany in 1935 and in the Netherlands in 1937. Shaw had disliked those versions so much that when producer Gabriel Pascal first approached him about filming an English version, the writer turned him down. Only when Pascal promised not to change a word and agreed to cast Wendy Hiller, whom Shaw had admired in stage productions of Pygmalion and St. Joan , did the great writer accede. Although she had already made one film, the low-budget 1937 comedy Lancashire Luck , Pascal gave her introductory billing in Pygmalion at Shaw’s request.\n\nDecades before the 1964 musical My Fair Lady swept the Academy Awards®, the author of Pygmalion , the play on which it was based, became a most unlikely Oscar® winner for the original’s 1938 screen adaptation. Possibly the most intelligent person to win the award (he might have claimed to be the only intelligent man to do so), Shaw holds the distinction of being the only individual to win both an Academy Award® and the Nobel Prize for Literature. Given his disdain for the movies, particularly those adapted from his own plays, it’s a minor miracle the film even got made and turned out to be a brilliant adaptation.\n\nThe result is a mind-bending movie within a documentary, by turns emotionally revolting, beautiful, and bizarre – one of the mass killers appears, as often as not, in drag. It is rarely entirely clear what is ‘acting’ and what is genuine.\n\nTo his surprise and horror, they were enthusiastic. They agreed to make a movie about how they killed and allowed him to film the process.\n\nJust look at this image from the movie:\n\n“When you’re a non-fiction filmmaker, you have to look at the real people you meet.”\n\n“It’s tempting to look at them through the lens of sort of fiction storytelling, where you have good guys and bad guys, good guys and then cackling villains,” Oppenheimer told CNN’s Hala Gorani, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour, on Monday.\n\nThat is exactly what documentary filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer did with several men who participated in mass killings in Indonesia decades ago.\n\nHow do we know what is in the mind of a mass murderer?

Conditions were expected to worsen overnight, with up to an inch of ice predicted in parts of Georgia and central South Carolina. Two to 6 inches of snow fell in north Georgia on Tuesday, with another 5 to 9 inches expected by Thursday morning, said National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Darbe. But Darbe said ice was the bigger worry, with a quarter to three-quarters of an inch expected in the area that includes metropolitan Atlanta. Officials were quick to make plans for dealing with the weather after being criticized for inadequate preparation before a storm two weeks ago.

In the margins of a guide to moral conduct. Because of course. “Scumbag,” sounds like the kind of hokey insult that would get you laughed at if you used it. When it was used in a New York Times, it got… Read… Technically, “fuck” appeared two times before this. In 1500, it was used in a satirical poem to describe some friars. In that case, nothing like “fuck” was actually written out. Instead, the word was hidden in a code. And in 1513, it appeared in a Scottish poem as “fukkit.” But for English’s first use, we’ve got a dissatisfied 1528 monk. He’s written “O D fuckin abbot.” Melissa Mohr, author of Holy Sh*t: A Brief History of Swearing, says this “fuck” could be either literal or metaphorical: It is difficult to know whether the annotator intended “fucking” to mean “having sex,” as in “that guy is doing too much fucking for someone who is supposed to be celibate,” or whether he used it as an intensifier, to convey his extreme dismay; if the latter, it anticipates the first recorded use by more than three hundred years. Either is possible, really—John Burton, the abbot in question, was a man of questionable monastic morals. So, either this monk was recording his abbot’s sex life or he was the first person to be so angry that only “fuck” could convey it’s scope.\n\nDid you all see the big joint news out of New York and Italy?  I’ve got a few articles on this mass arrest from both Italian and US sources:\n\nAccording to the Gazzetta Del Sud, this ‘Ndrangheta Mafia even used Mexican cartels in a joint venture in their set-up to traffic cocaine.\n\nAs for the US side of the take down: Arrests in New York and Italy Thwart Mob Drug Scheme, Authorities Say – NYTimes.com\n\n“They put a hundred grams, two hundred grams in each fish” and “it takes a day to defrost and then it takes a day to take out,” Franco Lupoi said, according to prosecutors who say the conversation was recorded by investigators. On Tuesday, federal authorities announced the arrests of Mr. Lupoi, the owner of a Brooklyn bakery, and six other people in New York on charges that included narcotics trafficking and money laundering and that were the culmination of a two-year undercover F.B.I. investigation. In Italy, the police announced the arrests of 17 people in connection with the investigation. What made the case remarkable were not the charges but the defendants’ links to the ’Ndrangheta, the organized crime group based in Calabria that is notorious for kidnappings and for its success importing cocaine into Europe.\n\nMore from the LA Times: Italian-U.S. Mafia drug trafficking ring busted, FBI and police say\n\nThe FBI and Italian police said they had broken up a global heroin and cocaine trafficking ring Tuesday after stumbling upon a fledgling alliance between a Calabrian Mafia group and associates of New York’s notorious Twenty-four arrests were made in Italy and the United States after a two-year operation that relied on both wiretaps and an American undercover agent named by investigators as “Jimmy,” who is said to have infiltrated the Gambinos and fooled Italians into believing he was a heroin dealer. Seventeen of the arrests were made in Italy and seven in the United States. Those arrested in the U.S. were arraigned before a federal magistrate in Brooklyn. The men, some of them suspected of being members of the Gambino and Bonanno “families,” were listed as using various street aliases such as “Lello,” “Freddy,” and “Charlie Pepsi.”\n\nI am sure more information will be coming forward, but…\n\nOne more link…on the additional discovery of ‘Ndrangheta connections with the Far East heroin trade: Gambino, Bonanno family members held in joint US-Italy anti-mafia raid – CNN.com\n\nRaffaele Grassi, head of the Criminal Unit of the Italian State Police, told reporters that the operation demonstrated that the “‘Ndrangheta is one of the strongest organizations in the world in illegal drug trade.” He cited its sophisticated network of contacts and its ability to adapt and find new markets, including “expanding beyond Italian borders.” Grassi said that historically, the Gambino family had had ties with the Sicilian Mafia, Cosa Nostra. But their involvement in the illegal traffic of heroin, known as the “Pizza Connection,” was dismantled or severely curtailed in the 1980s, he said, and they are now trading mainly cocaine. The latest operation, according to Grassi and FBI officials, shows that the mafia families of the “new continent” are still seeking and relying on “old country” connections — which is why investigators dubbed the operation “New Bridge.” According to Grassi, the Italian-American mafia families “need this new bridge to connect and support the traffic of cocaine.” While the existence of a connection between the Calabrian mafia and U.S. mafia families has been well known, Tuesday’s operation shows its great strength and reach, investigators said. One of the more alarming discoveries to emerge from the operation was evidence that ‘Ndrangheta has also reached out to the Far East in the heroin trade, another investigator said.\n\nWhile on the subject of the Mafia, 10 Real-Life Inspirations For Characters In The Godfather – Listverse\n\nIt’s one of the immutable laws of nature: You’re channel surfing, and there, between some cooking show and an infomercial, you come upon The Godfather. Even though you own the deluxe Blu-Ray DVD box set with three weeks’ worth of special features, you are glued to that station until the credits roll. And if it’s the first in a Godfather marathon, your day is shot. You’re not moving, except to warm up some frozen lasagna between Godfather 2 and Godfather 3. The Godfather is a classic of American cinema, and Godfather Part 2 is considered by some an even better movie. This story of the patriarch of a New York crime family, and his son who takes over the “family business,” is largely based on Mario Puzo’s novel of the same name, with director Francis Ford Coppola and Puzo producing new material for the films. Puzo based many of the characters on the real underworld players he heard about growing up and working in New York City.\n\nThat thing about getting stuck watching the trilogy on TV, it is so true…it just happened to my mom and me last week, and it was on one of those channels with the commercials. (So you know how annoying that can be, and how “glued” we were to stick it out for the three full movies.)\n\nIn wrapping this post up, I will end with this tune…a perfect finale to a mob focused post. I know that I have used this song before, but what can I say…\n\nHave a wonderful day, and if you are in the storm’s wake, please stay safe and warm.\n\nAnd be sure to share with us, what is on your reading list today?",

That much was clear today in the first of two major decisions (Hobby Lobby being the other) that could leave a lasting mark on his final term. The initial blow came earlier this morning, when all nine justices blasted the White House for making a unilateral decision to seat four nominees the Senate had blocked.\n\nWhen the chamber wasn’t rubber-stamping his agenda fast enough, the President took matters into his own hands in 2012 and filled vacancies to the National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau without the Senate’s consent. The President referred to them as “recess appointments,” which would have been defensible if the Senate had actually been in recess.\n\nIt wasn’t. Conservative leaders intentionally left the chamber in “pro-forma session,” which under Senate rules, should have blocked the White House from bypassing the chamber.\n\nIt didn’t. The Justice Department advised President Obama that since the leaders were out of town, the session wasn’t a legitimate one. So, the President ignored the legislative process and pulled the trigger on a handful of new hires that would have otherwise required Senate vetting.\n\nAt the time, members were shocked. Not because Presidents don’t make recess appointments (George W. Bush made 171), but because Presidents don’t set the congressional schedule. Unfortunately, the President has about as much regard for the Senate’s rules as he has for the Constitution’s.\n\nIn the first-ever case involving recess appointments, the justices raked the administration over the coals for treating Congress not just with irreverence, but irrelevance. “Because the Senate was in session during its pro forma sessions, the president made the recess appointments before us during a break too short to count as recess,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in the majority opinion. “For that reason, the appointments are invalid.”\n\nWhile every justice agreed, four of the originalists voted to severely limited the recess appointment powers altogether. They were overruled. Even so, the 9-0 decision was a powerful rebuke of what has become a pattern of this White House: lawlessness. This ruling of the Court should bolster support for Speaker John Boehner’s announcement yesterday that he would seek authority from the House to take President Obama to court for his “pen and phone” strategy of change or implementing policy without Congress.\n\nAs if the U.S. didn’t have enough to celebrate after the World Cup, Americans had plenty cheer about at the Supreme Court. In its second major decision of the day, pro-lifers claimed victory in the fight over sidewalk space outside abortion clinics. All nine justices, including the President’s prodigies, agreed that creating an invisible barrier between pro-lifers and clinic entrances was a ridiculous infringement on free speech rights.\n\nEleanor McCullen and other pro-lifers in Massachusetts often stood outside of abortion clinics and interacted with women seeking abortions in hopes of dissuading them. Eleanor would typically initiate a conversation with: “Good morning, may I give you my literature? Is there anything I can do for you? I’m available if you have any questions.” If a woman seems receptive, Eleanor will provide additional information. Because their polite and caring demeanor, these women have helped persuade hundreds of women to forgo abortions.\n\nIn a state like Massachusetts, plenty of liberals objected to the practice and worked to pass a law that makes it a crime to knowingly stand on a “public way or sidewalk” within 35 feet of an entrance or driveway to any place, other than a hospital, where abortions are performed. Massachusetts leaders claimed their law furthered public safety and order -- but the real aim was restricting pro-life speech. A transparent ploy the justices saw right through. Although the decision is narrower than we would have liked, the Court did agree that the Massachusetts law violated the First Amendment.\n\nWhile this is a good result, the Court should have acknowledged that the restriction was content-based. Justice Samuel Alito certainly recognized that, writing in his own opinion: “It is clear on the face of the Massachusetts law that it discriminates based on viewpoint. Speech in favor of the clinic and its work by employees and agents is permitted; speech criticizing the clinic and its work is a crime. This is blatant viewpoint discrimination.”\n\nAs Justice Scalia (joined by Justice Thomas, and importantly, Justice Kennedy) noted in a concurring opinion, “[e]very objective indication shows that the provision’s primary purpose is to restrict speech that opposes abortion.” In the end, thought, a ruling in favor of the First Amendment is better than a ruling upholding a prejudiced law. For more, check out Travis Weber’s analysis on the FRC Blog.\n\nUnfortunately, not every court was taking its cues from the Constitution this week. A federal judge in Indiana and the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals both used tortured reasoning to arrive at two decisions to strike down marriage laws. In perhaps the highest profile case on same-sex “marriage” in the country, a divided panel of judges sided against Utah’s amendment insisting that states can’t deprive people of the “fundamental right to marry” because they want to wed someone of the same sex. (What the Court fails to acknowledge is that no one is denied the right to marry -- provided they marry someone of the opposite sex.) By a 2-1 vote, the court essentially postmarked the case to the U.S. Supreme Court where justices left the door wide open for such a challenge after last summer’s Windsor and Perry decisions.\n\nTo his credit, Justice Paul Kelly wrote a passionate dissent, warning the court of overstepping its bounds. “We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Like so many other courts, the Tenth Circuit invents a right to marriage that even the Supreme Court did not find. In effect, the judges argue that Americans have the right to believe in the tradition of natural marriage -- but shouldn’t be able to protect it legislatively.\n\n“If the States are laboratories of democracy,” Kelly points out, “requiring every state to recognize same-gender unions -- contrary to the views of its electorate and representatives -- turns the notion of a limited national government on its head.” Meanwhile, in Indiana, voters are reaping what their legislators sowed after this year’s marriage debate, in which the legislature refused -- after weeks of back-and-forth --to put the issue on the ballot.

            "text": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A federal judge on Wednesday ruled Indiana’s ban on same-sex marriages was unconstitutional, sending hundreds of residents to make history by applying for marriage licenses and tying the knot. But the legal battles are far from over, and the celebrations may be short-lived.\n\nHere are five things to know about Judge Richard Young’s ruling:\n\nWHAT DOES IT MEAN?\n\nFor now, at least, same-sex couples can legally be married in Indiana, and the state must recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. The ruling also means same-sex couples can file joint tax returns, have their partners listed as their spouse on death certificates and receive the same pension benefits as heterosexual couples.\n\nWHERE CAN COUPLES GET A MARRIAGE LICENSE?\n\nCounty clerks’ offices are responsible for issuing marriage licenses, but not all offices granted licenses to same-sex couples Wednesday because they were awaiting guidance from the attorney general’s office. The office instructed clerks in Hamilton, Allen, Boone, Porter and Lake counties, which were named in the lawsuits challenging the ban, that they must comply with the court’s ruling or be subject to contempt of court. It said other county clerks aren’t under the direct jurisdiction of Young’s order but urged them to “show respect for the judge and the orders that are issued.”\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nThe Indiana attorney general’s office says it will seek a stay of Young’s order as it appeals the ruling. The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana says it will fight those efforts. Attorneys and advocates on both sides of the debate expect the U.S. Supreme Court to ultimately decide whether states must allow gay marriage.\n\nHOW DOES INDIANA FIT IN NATIONALLY?\n\nYoung’s ruling is part of a growing trend of lower courts throwing out gay-marriage bans since the U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates. Indiana is now the 20th state to allow gay marriage.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS TO THE STATE’S PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL BAN?\n\nSupporters of a constitutional ban on gay marriage had hoped to put the issue to Indiana voters this fall. But lawmakers stripped a sentence that would have barred future approval of civil unions, and the language change reset the clock. The earliest an amendment could appear before voters is 2016, but many believe Young’s ruling makes the issue moot.",

overturned utahs samesex marriage ban kelly dissented his opinion is an excellent example of conservative judicial restraint and offers support that beshear should note if he is truly serious about defending kentuckys traditional marriage regime kelly quoted us supreme court justice samuel alitos dissent in us v windsor which held that the federal government must recognize samesex marriages legal under state law samesex marriage presents a highly emotional and important question of public policy – but not a difficult question of constitutional law marriage is an issue for the states albeit consistent with federal constitutional guarantees wrote kelly if the states are the laboratories of democracy requiring every state to recognize samegender unions – contrary to the views of its electorate and representatives – turns the notion of a limited national government on its head because the us constitution does not address marriage much less samesex marriage heyburn and kelly addressed the threshold question of whether the cases presented a substantial federal question that a u s district court can adjudicate in 1972 the us supreme court held that an appeal from a ruling by minnesotas supreme court that neither due process nor equal protection conferred a constitutional right to marry on samesex couples did not present a substantial federal question normally that decision would bind lower federal courts as kelly concluded but heyburn said that subsequent doctrinal developments rendered it nonbinding whereas kelly reached a deferential and wellreasoned conclusion that subsequent doctrinal developments have not undermined the courts traditional deference to the states in the field of domestic relations heyburn cited a virtual tidal wave of such developments and said it is difficult to take that argument seriously both judges then considered whether samesex marriage bans violate equal protection they noted that even though the supreme court could have done so in windsor it had not declared samesex marriage to be a fundamental right deserving review under the most exacting standard called strict scrutiny kelly concluded that a more relaxed rational basis standard of review was appropriate heyburn preferred an intermediate standard but said kentuckys amendment could not survive regardless of the standard under rational basis review heyburn explained the plaintiffs have the burden to prove either that there is no conceivable legitimate purpose for the law or that the means chosen to effectuate a legitimate purpose are not rationally related to that purpose given the heavy burden of demonstrating that a law lacks any legitimate purpose or is irrationally unrelated to such purpose it is not surprising that most measures pass constitutional muster but heyburn emphatically rejected beshears argument that kentuckys amendment is rationally related to a legitimate purpose of encouraging promoting and supporting the formation of relationships that have the natural ability to procreate and thereby promotes a stable birth rate and economic stability this is apparently all beshear argued to sustain kentuckys laws but kellys opinion offers a bit more as kelly noted however the state can rely on any plausible reason to uphold the samesex marriage ban whether a reason actually motivated the electorate or the legislature is irrelevant and the fact that the classification could be improved or is illadvised is not enough to invalidate it kelly contended that utahs law should be upheld as rationally related to 1 responsible procreation 2 effective parenting and 3 the desire to proceed cautiously in this evolving area he noted arguments like heyburns that it is doubtful that the behavior of oppositegender couples is affected by samegender marriage but concluded that the classification need not be perfect but need only arguably serve the justifications urged by the state citing the reams of sociological evidence and scores of amicus briefs kelly concluded that the states position is at the very least arguable and most certainly is not arbitrary irrational or based upon legislative facts that no electorate or legislature could conceivably believe thus concluded kelly we should resist the temptation to become philosopherkings imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the fourteenth amendment heyburn disagreed those opposed by and large simply believe that the state has the right to adopt a particular religious or traditional view of marriage regardless of how it may affect gay and lesbian persons but as this court has respectfully explained in america even sincere and longheld religious views do not trump the constitutional rights of those who happen to have been outvoted these dueling opinions provide previews of how the supreme court will split when another samesex marriage case reaches it one need not oppose samesex marriage i dont to side with kelly i do nor support it i do to join heyburn i dont whether samesex marriage is good policy is a distinct question from whether the constitution compels it john david dyche is a louisville attorney

            "text": "By John David DycheWDRB ContributorIn his recent decision striking down Kentucky’s laws limiting marriage to one man and one woman, U.S. Senior District Judge John G. Heyburn II derisively dismissed arguments made by Kentucky governor Steve Beshear. “These arguments are not those of serious people,” Heyburn said.Judge Paul Kelly, Jr. of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is indisputably a serious person. President George H. W. Bush nominated both Heyburn and Kelly to the federal bench.When his court recently overturned Utah’s same-sex marriage ban, Kelly dissented. His opinion is an excellent example of conservative judicial restraint and offers support that Beshear should note if he is truly serious about defending Kentucky’s traditional marriage regime.Kelly quoted U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s dissent in U.S. v. Windsor, which held that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages legal under state law. “Same-sex marriage presents a highly emotional and important question of public policy – but not a difficult question of constitutional law.”Marriage is an issue for the states, “albeit consistent with federal constitutional guarantees,” wrote Kelly. “If the States are the laboratories of democracy, requiring every state to recognize same-gender unions – contrary to the views of its electorate and representatives – turns the notion of a limited national government on its head.”Because the U.S. Constitution does not address marriage, much less same-sex marriage, Heyburn and Kelly addressed the threshold question of whether the cases presented a substantial federal question that a U. S. District Court can adjudicate.In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an appeal from a ruling by Minnesota’s Supreme Court that neither due process nor equal protection conferred a constitutional right to marry on same-sex couples did not present a substantial federal question. Normally that decision would bind lower federal courts, as Kelly concluded, but Heyburn said that subsequent “doctrinal developments” rendered it non-binding.Whereas Kelly reached a deferential and well-reasoned conclusion that “subsequent doctrinal developments have not undermined the Court’s traditional deference to the States in the field of domestic relations,” Heyburn cited “a virtual tidal wave” of such developments and said “it is difficult to take [that argument] seriously.”Both judges then considered whether same-sex marriage bans violate equal protection. They noted that even though the Supreme Court could have done so in Windsor, it had not declared same-sex marriage to be a “fundamental right” deserving review under the most exacting standard, called “strict scrutiny.”Kelly concluded that a more relaxed “rational basis” standard of review was appropriate. Heyburn preferred an intermediate standard, but said Kentucky’s amendment could not survive “regardless of the standard.”Under “rational basis” review, Heyburn explained, “the plaintiffs have the burden to prove either that there is no conceivable legitimate purpose for the law or that the means chosen to effectuate a legitimate purpose are not rationally related to that purpose.” Given the heavy burden of demonstrating that a law lacks any legitimate purpose or is irrationally unrelated to such purpose, it is not surprising that most measures pass constitutional muster.But Heyburn emphatically rejected Beshear’s argument that Kentucky’s amendment is rationally related to a legitimate purpose of “encouraging, promoting, and supporting the formation of relationships that have the natural ability to procreate,” and thereby promotes a stable birth rate and economic stability. This is apparently all Beshear argued to sustain Kentucky’s laws, but Kelly’s opinion offers a bit more.As Kelly noted, however, the state can rely on any plausible reason to uphold the same-sex marriage ban. “Whether a reason actually motivated the electorate or the legislature is irrelevant,” and “the fact that the classification could be improved or is ill-advised is not enough to invalidate it.”Kelly contended that Utah’s law should be “upheld as rationally related to (1) responsible procreation, (2) effective parenting, and (3) the desire to proceed cautiously in this evolving area.” He noted arguments, like Heyburn’s, that “it is doubtful that the behavior of opposite-gender couples is affected by same-gender marriage,” but concluded that the classification need not be perfect, but “need only arguably serve the justifications urged by the state.”Citing “the reams of sociological evidence” and “scores of amicus briefs,” Kelly concluded that “the State’s position is (at the very least) arguable,” and “most certainly is not arbitrary, irrational, or based upon legislative facts that no electorate or legislature could conceivably believe.” Thus, concluded Kelly, “We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.”Heyburn disagreed. “Those opposed by and large simply believe that the state has the right to adopt a particular religious or traditional view of marriage regardless of how it may affect gay and lesbian persons. But, as this Court has respectfully explained, in America even sincere and long-held religious views do not trump the constitutional rights of those who happen to have been out-voted.”These dueling opinions provide previews of how the Supreme Court will split when another same-sex marriage case reaches it. One need not oppose same-sex marriage (I don’t) to side with Kelly (I do), nor support it (I do) to join Heyburn (I don’t). Whether same-sex marriage is good policy is a distinct question from whether the Constitution compels it.",

The high court could choose from cases moving through five other federal appellate courts, and wouldn’t consider a case until next year at the earliest.\n\nRuling from 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/13/13-4178.pdf\n\n--McCombs reported from Salt Lake City.

The decision upheld a lower court ruling that struck down Utah's gay marriage ban. However, the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals panel immediately put Wednesday's ruling on hold so it could be appealed, either to the entire 10th Circuit or directly to the nation's highest court. The decision gives increased momentum to a legal cause that already compiled an impressive winning streak in the lower courts after the Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates. The latest of those rulings was in Indiana, where a federal judge on Wednesday struck down that state's same-sex marriage ban in a ruling that immediately allows gay couples to wed. The Indiana attorney general's office said it will appeal. Same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the Washington capital district. Recent polls show a majority of Americans support it.",

ruling the same way or dont even need to rule as in the first second third and dc circuits because of legislative legalization unappealed lower court decisions or unappealable stategrounds decisions from state high courts the conservatives know theyll be outvoted so have an incentive not to grant cert for the liberals the political victory of gay marriage will seem far more secure if it the product of 20 separate judicial and political decisions rather than one supreme court ruling the only courts of appeals with a real chance to hold against gay marriage are the fourth and the fifth circuits and well have their decisions within weeks fourth and a few months fifth to conscience of a conservative eyeamok to be the devils advocate i agree but no state is required to perform any marriage with that these states should just ban marriage at the state level and leave it up to churches not necessarily a bad idea but it would be in the short term at least a logistical nightmare marriage is intertwined with so many different areas of the law exactly which is why it is a bad idea as tempting as it may seem that would be a radical overhaul of the way our society has handled

            "text": "DENVER (AP) - A federal appeals court ruled for the first time Wednesday that states cannot prevent gay couples from getting married, extending the movement's legal winning streak and bringing the issue a big step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe three-judge panel in Denver ruled 2-1 that states cannot deprive people of the fundamental right to marry simply because they choose a partner of the same sex.\n\n\"It is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples,\" the judges wrote, addressing arguments that the ruling could undermine traditional marriage.\n\nThe decision by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld a lower-court ruling that struck down Utah's gay marriage ban. It becomes law in the six states covered by the 10th Circuit: Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. But the panel immediately put the ruling on hold pending an appeal.\n\nThe Utah attorney general's office planned to appeal the decision but it was assessing whether to go directly to the U.S. Supreme Court or ask the entire 10th Circuit to review the ruling, spokeswoman Missy Larsen said.\n\nWednesday's decision \"takes us one step closer to reaching certainty and finality,\" the office said in a statement.\n\nAfter the ruling, the couples named in the appeal hugged, cried and exchanged kisses at a news conference outside their attorney's offices in downtown Salt Lake City.\n\n\"This decision is an absolute victory for fairness and equality for all families in Utah, in every state in the 10th Circuit and every state in this great nation of the United States,\" said their attorney, Peggy Tomsic.\n\nPlaintiff Derek Kitchen said he and his partner, Moudi Sbeity, are \"so proud to be a part of.........\n\n\n\nWell, that was a short stop at “each state can make its own rules on this”, which is what advocates had been saying for a long time. For the most part, gay marriage is court-imposed. Most states that held votes on it voted against it. And now the courts are saying there is a “consensus” for gay marriage. There is a consensus only among the judges. \n\n\n\nCivil Unions between homosexual couples are not recognized as marriage under the eyes of god. They want to make fools of themselves, let them. Frankly I just laugh and ask how the civil union is working out. Went through this with my friend’s brother a couple of weeks back. I asked him how was the civil union working out. He gets all snarky and says he is married. So I asked him what church he get married in. He calls me a homophobe. I said that’s a vast improvement from all the times he called me a racist. \n\n\n\nI dont agree in any way but the Feds dont do Marriage, My first inclination is to tell the Inferior Court to go pound sand, and arrest the Judge for subverting the rights of a FREE STATE, while citing the US Constitution where it says “ In All Cases where a State is a party to the action, the Supreme Court SHALL have original jurisdiction.” But marriage is and always has been a State Issue, The State could ELIMINATE MARRIAGE altogether and any and all laws associated with it. And then they don’t have to recognize ANY marriage. No Benefit, No big deal.\n\n I agree surrender is not an option, but since Congress refuses to do it’s job, the States will have to call their bluff and then punch them right in the nose and force them from society. Hell name the law Eliminating marriage after the JUDGE. \n\n\n\nMarriage is a civic matter. It is really not, together with all its circumstances, the business of the church. It is so only when a matter of conscience is involved. —Martin Luther The Reformers believed that marriage was largely a civil matter, as far as I can tell. Of course they never imagined anything like ‘gay marriage’ and would have certainly rejected it, even though the civil authorities accepted it. But once it became a civil matter, the state in the modern era just kept changing it and by that time many had become conditioned to think the state actually could define and redefine it, first with really easy civil divorce and remarriage and now with ‘gay marriage.’ \n\n\n\n\"Somewhere the Strategy must change in order to prevail.\"\n\n \n\n I've been saying just that for years, my friend. \n\n \n\n We won the early victories, and have been coasting on that ever since. We stopped listening, while the left has been adapting their strategy, learning from defeat and winning. Winning in the courts, in the legislatures and (worst of all) in the hearts and minds of \"We the People\". Now what was incomprehensible two decades ago is now supported by a majority of Americans.\n\n \n\n I fear that this particular war is lost, but you are absolutely right. We do need to change our strategy so we don't lose the next one. \n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

that samesex marriage is constitutionally protected in a decision that is expected to bring the issue closer to the us supreme court the 21 ruling by the 10th circuit court of appeals upheld a lower court ruling that struck down utahs gay marriage ban and gives a boost to a growing momentum of legal victories by advocates for samesex marriage the utah attorney generals office said it will appeal the decision to the us supreme court some 16 federal judges have issued rulings in favour of gay marriage but wednesdays ruling represents the first time a federal appeal court has ruled on the issue since last summers landmark ruling against the defense of marriage act doma and californias samesex marriage ban the legal precedent the appeal court set will apply to same sex marriage in all six states in the 10th circuit wyoming colorado new mexico kansas and oklahoma as well as utah but the judge issued a stay blocking it from taking effect pending appeal it was immediately hailed as an extremely exciting victory by campaigners for samesex marriage who said that the utah case could now potentially reach the supreme court courts do not sit in judgment of the hearts and minds of citizens said the 10th us circuit court of appeals majority after ruling that a state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons or refuse to recognize their marriage based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union the appeal courts ruling upheld a federal judges decision in december 2013 that a 2004 voterapproved ban on samesex marriage is unconstitutional the ruling came moments after another federal judge in a lower court struck down indianas ban on gay marriage shannon minter the legal director of the national center for lesbian rights and counsel in the case said the ruling changes the legal landscape enormously this is the first time that a federal court of appeal has ruled that same sex couples have a right to marriage it is one step away from the supreme court he said the supreme court is under no obligation as to which cases – or indeed any cases – it chooses to hear in order for samesex marriage bans in the 10th circuit states to be overturned a state or federal court would have to rule they are not bound by the 10th circuits decision minter said but the court is extremely influential new mexico already has gay marriage and there are three cases challenging samesex marriage bans one in wyoming and two in colorado he said a state challenge to a lower court ruling striking down a gay marriage ban in oklahoma will also be decided by the 10th circuit in a ruling expected soon the state now has the option to request an en banc appeal before the full bench of the 10th circuit the 10th circuit decides whether or not to grant that request if it is denied the defendants can also appeal todays ruling to the us supreme court they may also bypass an en banc session and appeal directly to the supreme court sarah warbelow legal director of the human rights campaign described the decision on wednesday as hugely momentous the 10th circuit is not known as a particularly liberal court more a middle of the road court she said noting that judges appointed by both democrats and republicans are ruling in favour of gay marriage rights for a brief period utah became the 18th state where marriage rights were extended to samesex couples after judge robert shelbys ruling in december some 1300 samesex couples were married in utah before a judge granted the state an emergency stay in january in oklahoma a judge set aside his order before any marriages took place utah argued that voters and politicians have the right to define marriage not the judiciary it said that that redefining marriage in genderless terms could affect religious freedom provoke civil strife result in a declining birth rate and suggested that children do better in partnerships with a father and a mother than they do with samesex couples in his ruling 10th circuit judge carlos lucero said that the state had argued that permitting same marriage would have far reaching and drastic consequences for utahs oppositesex couples but he concluded we emphatically agree with the numerous cases decided since windsor that it is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of the love and commitment between samesex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of oppositesex couples he dismissed the states argument that children do better in opposite marriages as tepid on strict scrutiny an argument based only on pure speculation and conjecture can not carry the day he said citing the windsor majority which stressed the detrimental effect of doma on the children of samesex parents by communicating that samesex parents are less deserving of family recognition than other parents lucero said that the utah amendment conveyed a similarly harmful message lucero who was named to the court by bill clinton with judge jerome holmes a george w bush nominee agreeing in his dissent wednesday 10th circuit justice paul j kelly jr said the court was overstepping its authority and that states should be able to decide who can marry we should resist the temptation to become philosopherkings imposing our views under the guise of the fourteenth amendment he wrote there are over 70 court cases challenging marriage bans across 30 states and puerto rico according to the human rights campaign samesex couples can legally marry in 19 states and the district of columbia while 31 have a law or constitutional amendment restricting marriage to the union of one man and one woman",

But Wednesday's ruling represents the first time a federal appeal court has ruled on the issue since last summer's landmark ruling against the Defense of Marriage Act (Doma) and California's same-sex marriage ban.\n\nThe legal precedent the appeal court set will apply to same sex marriage in all six states in the 10th circuit, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, and Oklahoma as well as Utah, but the judge issued a stay, blocking it from taking effect, pending appeal.\n\nIt was immediately hailed as an “extremely exciting” victory by campaigners for same-sex marriage, who said that the Utah case could now potentially reach the supreme court.\n\n\"Courts do not sit in judgment of the hearts and minds of citizens,\" said the 10th US circuit court of appeals majority after ruling that \"a state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union.\"\n\nThe appeal court's ruling upheld a federal judge's decision in December 2013 that a 2004 voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.\n\nThe ruling came moments after another federal judge in a lower court struck down Indiana's ban on gay marriage.\n\nShannon Minter, the legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and counsel in the case, said the ruling “changes the legal landscape enormously”.\n\n“This is the first time that a federal court of appeal has ruled that same sex couples have a right to marriage … it is one step away from the supreme court,” he said.\n\nThe supreme court is under no obligation as to which cases – or indeed any cases – it chooses to hear.\n\nIn order for same-sex marriage bans in the 10th circuit states to be overturned, a state or federal court would have to rule. They are not bound by the 10th circuit's decision, Minter said, but the court is “extremely influential”.\n\nNew Mexico already has gay marriage, and there are three cases challenging same-sex marriage bans, one in Wyoming and two in Colorado, he said.\n\nA state challenge to a lower court ruling striking down a gay marriage ban in Oklahoma will also be decided by the 10th circuit, in a ruling expected soon.\n\nThe state now has the option to request an en banc appeal before the full bench of the 10th circuit. The 10th circuit decides whether or not to grant that request. If it is denied, the defendants can also appeal today’s ruling to the US supreme court.\n\nThey may also bypass an en banc session and appeal directly to the supreme court.\n\nSarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, described the decision on Wednesday as “hugely momentous” .\n\n“The 10th circuit is not known as a particularly liberal court, more a middle of the road court,“ she said, noting that judges appointed by both Democrats and Republicans are ruling in favour of gay marriage rights.\n\nFor a brief period, Utah became the 18th state where marriage rights were extended to same-sex couples after Judge Robert Shelby's ruling in December. Some 1,300 same-sex couples were married in Utah before a judge granted the state an emergency stay in January. In Oklahoma, a judge set aside his order before any marriages took place.\n\nUtah argued that voters and politicians have the right to define marriage, not the judiciary. It said that that redefining marriage in genderless terms could affect religious freedom, provoke civil strife, result in a declining birth rate, and suggested that children do better in partnerships with a father and a mother than they do with same-sex couples.\n\nIn his ruling, 10th circuit judge Carlos Lucero said that the state had argued that permitting same marriage would have “far reaching and drastic consequences” for Utah's opposite-sex couples. But he concluded: “We emphatically agree with the numerous cases decided since Windsor that it is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of the love and commitment between same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples.”\n\nHe dismissed the state's argument that children do better in opposite marriages as “tepid”.\n\n“On strict scrutiny, an argument based only on pure speculation and conjecture cannot carry the day,” he said.\n\nCiting the Windsor majority, which stressed the detrimental effect of Doma on the children of same-sex parents, by communicating that same-sex parents are less deserving of family recognition than other parents, Lucero said that the Utah amendment conveyed a similarly “harmful message”.\n\nLucero, who was named to the court by Bill Clinton, with Judge Jerome Holmes, a George W Bush nominee, agreeing.\n\nIn his dissent Wednesday, 10th circuit justice Paul J Kelly Jr said the court was overstepping its authority and that states should be able to decide who can marry.\n\n\"We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of the Fourteenth Amendment,\" he wrote.\n\nThere are over 70 court cases challenging marriage bans, across 30 states and Puerto Rico, according to the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nSame-sex couples can legally marry in 19 states and the District of Columbia, while 31 have a law or constitutional amendment restricting marriage to the union of one man and one woman.",

            "text": "In Kitchen v Herbert [13-4178] before Judges Kelly, Lucero and Holmes, the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver yesterday upheld a ruling by a lower court striking down the same-sex marriage ban in Utah.\n\nThe 2 to 1 judges’ decision held that the Constitution protects marriage as a fundamental right.  Same-sex couples are included in this protection, and so cannot be deprived of the right to marry, just because they choose to marry a person of the same-sex.\n\nMay a State of the Union constitutionally deny a citizen the benefit or protection of the laws of the State based soley upon the sex of the person that citizen chooses to marry?\n\n“Having heard and carefully considered the argument of the litigants, we conclude that, consistent with the United States Constitution, the State of Utah may not do so. We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right to marry, establish a family, raise children, and enjoy the full protection of a state’s marital laws. A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union. For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm”.\n\nThis was countering the argument that traditional marriage would be undermined. The decision also held that there was no reasonable objection to same-sex marriage.\n\nThis decision means that same-sex marriage will now be legal in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming, all states which are covered by the 10th Circuit.\n\nHowever, the decision was put on hold pending an appeal by Utah’s Attorney-General, Sean D. Reyes. A spokesman for the AG said that they intend to file a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the Supreme Court. Governor Gary R. Herbert, who was disappointed with the ruling, said he believed that states should have the right to determine marriage laws, and that Utahns should have the finality and clarity that only comes from a decision by the Supreme Court.\n\nMeanwhile, LGBT supporters and the same-sex couples involved in the court case, Derek Kitchen, Moudi Sbeity, Karen Archer, Kate Call, Laurie Wood and Kody Partridge, are hailing the decision as a “victory for fairness and equality”.\n\nAdding to the list of states that now allow same-sex marriage, Indiana yesterday also saw federal judge Richard Young strike down their ban on same-sex marriage, allowing couples to marry immediately in that state. Both the Indiana and Utah decisions were made the day before the anniversary of the striking down of parts of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) by the Supreme Court on 26th June last year.\n\nHowever, in regard to the Indiana decision, Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) believes that the Supreme Court will reverse Judge Young’s ruling, reinstating the marriage ban.",

It was the first time an appellate court determined last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act means states cannot deny gays the ability to wed.\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel put its Oklahoma and Utah rulings on hold pending an appeal. Utah's attorney general has said he plans to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nGay marriage in the two states will remain on hold.\n\nStill, the decisions give increased momentum to a legal cause that has compiled an impressive string of lower court victories. More than 20 courts have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates since the Supreme Court's DOMA ruling in June 2013. The rulings have come in 17 states, with Florida being the latest.\n\nTwo of the most striking of those decisions were in conservative Utah and Oklahoma, which saw their voter-approved gay marriage bans struck down in December and January, respectively. In Utah, more than 1,000 same-sex couples married before the Supreme Court issued a stay.\n\nIt's unclear whether the two cases will be the first to reach the Supreme Court. The high court could choose from cases moving through five other federal appellate courts, and it won't consider a case until next year at the earliest.\n\nAttorneys representing Utah and Oklahoma argued voters have the right to define marriage in their states, and unions between a man and woman are best for children.\n\nGay rights lawyers countered that voters cannot define marriage in a way that deprives gay people of their fundamental rights, and say there is no proof that gay couples make inferior parents.\n\nTen years ago, nearly a dozen states outlawed gay marriage. Now same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia, and recent polls show a majority of Americans support it.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized a quote from the one judge who disagreed with the decision to overturn Oklahoma's same-sex marriage ban as a quote from the 10th Circuit panel's majority opinion.

            "text": "In a 2-1 decision today, a federal appeals court in Denver upheld a ruling from 2013 that Utah’s ban on same-sex marriage recognition is unconstitutional.\n\nIf Utah chooses to appeal this latest ruling (which the judge has put on hold for the state to consider its options), it will be up to the Supreme Court to decide if it wants to hear it.\n\nIn the majority decision, Judge Carlos Lucero writes, \"We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right to marry, establish a family, raise children, and enjoy the full protection of a state’s marital laws. A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union.\" Read the decision here.\n\nIn the dissent, Judge Paul J. Kelly said the court was overstepping its authority: We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nAssuming Utah continues its appeal, the Supreme Court would have to decide to take the case up and consider whether setting a legal precedent that gay marriage recognition is or is not a right. If they decline to take up the case, technically they are avoiding the precedent, but given that federal judges have been striking down gay marriage bans wherever they’ve been challenged (less than an hour before this announcement, a judge struck down Indiana’s ban, and the state has already begun handing out marriage licenses), gay marriage recognition is likely to become the law of the land anyway.\n\nUPDATE: Utah's attorney general has said he will be asking the Supreme Court to take the case.",

of justice doj wolf blitzer 23 comments good morning yesterday president obama met with texas governor rick perry to discuss the socalled immigration crisis perry had initially refused to shake hands with the president as obama disembarked from airforce one but perry ended up doing it anyway from mediaite rick perry admits defeat shakes president obamas hand governor rick perry rtx was determined not to shake president barack obama s hand when he arrived at dallasfort worth airport on wednesday but in the end it appears he just couldnt help himself as cnns wolf blitzer said while obama was descending the steps of air force one im anxious to see if the governor rick perry the governor of texas is there at the bottom of the stairs to receive the president of the united states the anchor betrayed some surprise when perry walked across the tarmac to greet obama shaking his hand and walking side by side to marine one where they would have a private meeting about the current crisis at the border its been ages since ive watched cnn but it sounds like wolf and his network are practically outdoing fox news do they not see the racial implications of a republican governor resisting shaking hands with an africanamerican president on monday the austin americanstatesman reported rick perry declines obama offer for quick handshake at austin airport gov rick perry monday turned down what he characterized as president barack obamas offer for a quick handshake on the tarmac at austinbergstrom international airport on wednesday but said he would juggle his schedule to accommodate a substantive meeting with the president on the border crisis any time during his twoday visit to texas in a letter to the president perry wrote i appreciate the offer to greet you at austinbergstrom airport but a quick handshake on the tarmac will not allow for a thoughtful discussion regarding the humanitarian and national security crises enveloping the rio grande valley in south texas i would instead offer to meet with you at any time during your visit to texas for a substantive meeting to discuss this critical issue with the appropriate notice i am willing to change my schedule to facilitate this request at any point while you are here i am available to sit down privately so we can talk and you may directly gain my states perspective on the effects of an unsecured border and what is necessary to make it secure perry wrote the president in addition perry actually said on abcs this week on sunday i dont believe he particularly cares whether or not the border of the united states is secure perry said sunday on abcs this week charging the president was either inept or had an ulterior motive in failing to secure the border back to the mediaite story following perrys letter the obama administration decided to invite the governor to join obama at a previously scheduled meeting with faith leaders and elected officials in dallas following that concession perry decided he would be comfortable greeting obama on the tarmac though he did not indicate whether he would deign to shake the presidents hand if perry was wary of the type of photoop that has haunted republicans like governor chris christie rnj and former republicans like charlie crist he can at least be thankful that the president did not try to hug him though he did give him a few friendly pats on the back mediaite thinks the photos will doom perrys chances for the 2016 republican nomination but after his performance in 2012 it seems pretty obvious that perry himself will destroy his presidential hopes all by himself so what happened when the two men met the new york times reports obama presses perry to rally support for border funds according to the authors jackie calmes and ashley parker obama directly challenged perry to convince congressional republicans to support 37 billion in emergency funds to deal with what perry has called a humanitarian crisis — thousands of central american children who have crossed the mexican border and from the wire rick perrys immigration meeting with obama produces photo for the ages so how did president obamas meeting with republican governor rick perry go today in a statement on wednesday obama described the meeting as constructive but well this photo also exists its not immediately clear what the context of this photo was — is perry sad uncomfortable telling a funny story happy but trying to look serious hmm perhaps someone made a joke at perrys expense or maybe perry just makes the robert de niro shrug face a lot for no reason anyway it doesnt matter right now until we know more about the context the photo will be a rorschach test in the future there will be midrash about this photo a couple more links on the border crisis the washington post dana milbank in border crisis obama is accused of lawlessness for following law a querulous quartet of conservatives took to the senate floor wednesdayto criticize the president for failing to visit the border during his visit to texas this week was coordinated by sen john mccain and included fellow arizonan jeff flake and both of the chambers texans sen john cornyn and the man mccain once dubbed a wacko bird sen ted cruz president obama today is down in the state of texas but sadly hes not visiting the border said cruz in a rare collaboration with mccain hes visiting democratic fat cats to collect checks and apparently theres no time to look at the disaster at the devastation thats being caused by his policies it is a disaster that is the direct consequence of president obamas lawlessness but this border crisis sowed years ago and building for months is neither a high crime nor a misdemeanor its a humanitarian nightmare in which children some as young as 4 can face physical and sexual abuse injury and death in their lonely journeys whats upsidedown about the cruzpalin argument is that this crisis has actually been brought about by obama following the law the most obvious and direct cause of the flood of children from central america is the 2008 human trafficking law that ended the rapid deportation of unaccompanied minors who come illegally from countries other than mexico and canada the law essentially guarantees long stays for these immigrants by promising them a deportation process that can take 18 months during which time they are often placed with family members who have little incentive to have the kids show up for hearings lindsay graham disagrees with his good buddy mccain according to the hill republicans will take the political fall if they dont provide emergency funds to address the immigrant crisis at the southern border sen lindsey graham rsc warned wednesday a number of conservatives on capitol hill are pushing back hard against president obamas request for almost 4 billion to manage the spike of immigrants — thousands of them unaccompanied minors — thats hit the texasmexico border in recent months but graham a longtime supporter of an immigration system overhaul said a failure to provide the funds will exacerbate the crisis while handing obama and the democrats a political victory ahead of novembers midterm elections if we do that then were going to get blamed for perpetuating the problem graham told reporters on wednesday well it wouldnt be the first time that right wing republicans acted against their political best interest in other news mike pence another republican governor has made an ass of himself not for the first time indiana governor mike pence has told state agencies to not to honor the hundreds of gay marriages that took place after a federal court in indianapolis invalidated as unconstitutional indianas law banning samesex marriages indiana gov mike pences office is telling state agencies act as if no gay marriages had been performed during three days following a federal court order the memo from the governors chief counsel tells executive branch agencies to execute their functions as though the june 25 court order had not been issued pence defended the memo wednesday and the sentiment expressed in it wednesday afternoon he said it was his job as governor to carry out the laws of the state of indiana the state of indiana must operate in a manner with the laws of indiana so we have directed our state agencies earlier this week to conduct themselves in a way that respects current indiana law pending this matters process through the courts pence said a disappointed beth white responded to pences order as clerk of marion county i was proud our office was able to issue these licenses and officiate over 450 weddings for couples many of whom have been in loving committed relationships for decades governor pence owes these couples an explanation on why he continues to deem them as second class citizens they legally obtained their license paid the requisite fee and should be entitled to the same rights and privileges the rest of us enjoy it is time for our state leaders to put the issue behind us so that we can focus on strengthening the middleclass investing in quality education and rebuilding indianas economy hoosier businesses depend on the best and brightest employees to compete in the global economy indiana is rolling up the welcome mat with this regressive stance on this issue although my opponent has a long history of opposing marriage equality i call on mrs lawson to reject governor pences ruling today the office of the secretary of state should be welcoming to all employers choosing to invest or reinvest in indiana and that includes their prospective employees and their families hoosiers deserve common sense leadership that is focused on moving indiana forward the office of the director of national intelligence has released an official statement in response to the latest article and statements by glenn greenwald that suggest without any supporting evidence that us intelligence agencies are essentially duplicating the illegal actions of cointelpro from 19561971 joint statement by the office of the director of national intelligence and the department of justice on courtordered legal surveillance of us persons it is entirely false that us intelligence agencies conduct electronic surveillance of political religious or activist figures solely because they disagree with public policies or criticize the government or for exercising constitutional rights unlike some other nations the united states does not monitor anyones communications in order to suppress criticism or to put people at a disadvantage based on their ethnicity race gender sexual orientation or religion our intelligence agencies help protect america by collecting communications when they have a legitimate foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purpose with limited exceptions for example in an emergency our intelligence agencies must have a court order from the foreign intelligence surveillance court to target any us citizen or lawful permanent resident for electronic surveillance these court orders are issued by an independent federal judge only if probable cause based on specific facts are established that the person is an agent of a foreign power a terrorist a spy or someone who takes orders from a foreign power no us person can be the subject of surveillance based solely on first amendment activities such as staging public rallies organizing campaigns writing critical essays or expressing personal beliefs on the other hand a person who the court finds is an agent of a foreign power under this rigorous standard is not exempted just because of his or her occupation the united states is as committed to protecting privacy rights and individual freedom as we are to defending our national security take from that what you will the greenwald cultists simply dismiss statements coming that from the government as lies and assume the worst my tendency is to base my opinions on evidence so far i havent seen evidence in anything coming from the snowden leaks that nsa is specifically targeting people because of their political andor religious beliefs in my opinion the fbi has done this but greenwalds latest article doesnt even present valid evidence against the fbi on the other hand id like to see congress do a serious investigation of what nsa and other intelligence agencies are actually doing and particularly id like the government to address the issue of whether the five americans named in greenwalds article were actually targeted and why the supposed targeting happened before 2008 so perhaps it wouldnt hurt if more information were released about the reasons for further reactions to the latest claims from the intercept and the washington post–and to the

women reading good morning wolf blitzer must be celebrating this morning because the mystery plane is back in the headlines associated press reports via ctv sydney australia — investigators looking into the disappearance of the malaysia airlines plane are confident it was on autopilot when it crashed in a remote stretch of the indian ocean australian officials said thursday as they announced the latest shift in the search for the jet after analyzing data exchanged between the plane and a satellite officials believe flight 370 was on autopilot the entire time it was flying across a vast expanse of the southern indian ocean based on the straight path it took australian transport safety bureau chief commissioner martin dolan said certainly for its path across the indian ocean we are confident that the aircraft was operating on autopilot until it ran out of fuel dolan told reporters in canberra the nations capital asked whether the autopilot would have to be manually switched on or whether it could have been activated automatically under a default setting dolan replied the basic assumption would be that if the autopilot is operational its because its been switched on but exactly why the autopilot would have been set on a flight path so far off course from the jets destination of beijing and exactly when it was switched on remains unknown the new york times explains what likely happened a report issued by the australian transport safety bureau outlining how the new search zone had been chosen said that the most likely scenario as the aircraft headed south across the indian ocean on march 8 was that the crew was suffering from hypoxia or was otherwise unresponsive hypoxia occurs when a plane loses air pressure and the pilots lacking adequate oxygen become confused and incapable of performing even basic manual tasks pilots are trained to put on oxygen masks immediately if an aircraft suffers depressurization their masks have an hours air supply compared with only a few minutes for the passengers the plane which left kuala lumpur malaysia bound for beijing with 239 people aboard made its turn south toward the indian ocean about an hour after it stopped responding to airtraffic controllers evidence for an unresponsive crew as the plane flew south includes the loss of radio communications a long period with no maneuvering of the aircraft a steadily maintained cruise altitude and eventual fuel exhaustion and descent the report said given these observations the final stages of the unresponsive crewhypoxia event type appeared to best fit the available evidence for the final period of mh370s flight when it was heading in a generally southerly direction the document said based on the report a new search zone has been designated according to the la times experts from boeing and the us national transportation safety board were among the specialists who helped define the zone based on satellite data and analysis of previous similar incidents the new zone about 1100 miles west of perth australia is farther south than where previous intensive search efforts were carried out this spring after the plane vanished march 8 with 239 people aboard the flight was en route from kuala lumpur to beijing when it went missing australia deputy prime minister warren truss said the search was continuing with a mapping of the ocean floor in the newly defined area to be followed by a comprehensive seafloor search the seafloor search he said should start around august and be completed within one year the area is 58 miles wide and 400 miles long covering an area as big as lake huron the secondlargest of the us great lakes by comparison the area searched with a robotic sonarequipped submarine in may was about 330 square miles first gay marriage license issued in indiana there was exciting news yesterday in the struggle to legalize samesex marriage state by state from npr federal judges reverse gaymarriage bans in utah indiana utah and indiana are the latest states to see their bans on samesex marriage struck down by a federal court following rulings in both states wednesday that found the prohibition unconstitutional in utah the 10th circuit court of appeals panel upheld a lower court ruling striking down the states gaymarriage ban and in indiana us district judge richard young made a similar ruling it is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of samesex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of oppositesex couples the threejudge panel in the utah case said the panel immediately put the ruling on hold pending its appeal either to the entire 10th circuit or directly to the us supreme court according to the associated press in indiana young wrote samesex couples who would otherwise qualify to marry in indiana have the right to marry in indiana these couples when gender and sexual orientation are taken away are in all respects like the family down the street the constitution demands that we treat them as such both decisions are significant in that they may influence decisions in other states carl tobias a law professor at the university of richmond writes npr in an email that the utah decision is very significant as it is the first appellate court to address the marriage equality issue the 4th circuit in virginia may well apply the reasoning of the 10th circuit opinion as will numerous district courts that have yet to rule he says the indiana ruling invalidating its ban today also used similar reasoning tobias says all courts are finding that the bans violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th amendment in another breakthrough republican senator susan collins of maine has announced that she supports samesex marriage from the washington post a number of states including my home state of maine have now legalized samesex marriage and i agree with that decision collins said in a statement adding later i have long opposed efforts to impose a federal ban on samesex marriage in both 2004 and 2006 i voted against amendments to the united states constitution that would

reports team usa everythings on the line for germany match its been a roller coaster ride for the american team so far in the world cup the team that on paper many pundits didnt expect to advance now has a real shot at moving on to the second round and as cbs news elaine quijano reports that fate is hinged on beating or at least coming up even against one of the cup favorites germany team usa was greeted with cheers from american fans wednesday as they arrived in the brazilian city of recife players spent the three days between matches recovering and regrouping after a physical first game against ghana and an emotional tie against portugal this is the biggest game of a lot of our lives so any fatigue in our legs will be erased said american midfielder kyle beckerman weve got to give everything weve got and more team usa began their world cup run in the socalled group of death but their aggression attacks and overall stamina on the pitch have defied pundits who originally dismissed their chances of advancing i think some people might be a little bit surprised at our results so far coach jurgen klinsmann said wednesday we are by no means any underdog here in this tournament but we know its the biggest hurdle we have to take now with germany klinsman suggested that us fans should take a day off work to watch the game and wrote a letter to bosses asking them to excuse their employees absences reports reuters in the style of a doctors note klinsmann addresses employers and asks them to forgive their staff for their absence the letter was distributed on social networks by the us soccer i understand that this absence may reduce the productivity of your workplace but i can assure you that it is for an important cause wrote klinsmann the usmnt us mens national

heartbreaking comefromahead draw against portugal in the world cup on sunday soccer analysts and twitter users scrambled to figure out the many ways the us can still get to the next round with a threepoint lead over portugal and ghana in group g the americans can advance even if they lose their match against germany at noon eastern today depending on the outcome of the portugalghana game played at the same time deadspin has one of the better graphical breakdown s of every potential scenario for the us including the dreaded drawing of lots all the focus on permutations and goaldifferential scenarios has undercut the importance of todays game for american soccer theres not as much at stake goes the implication because we can move ahead even if we lose to germany but this is about more than getting to the next round this is an opportunity for the us to face one of soccers elite teams on the biggest stage and prove it can hang with—even beat—any country in this world cup before the tournament most people thought it would be an unlikely success for the us just to get out of the socalled group of death and to the round of 16 now after beating ghana and dominating much of the game against portugal the us can dream bigger beat germany and america wins its group for the second straight world cup a result nearly unthinkable when the draw was announced in december beat germany and the us secures a favorable round of 16 match most likely against algeria or russia rather than a trickier faceoff with sneakygood belgium just as important a win would mean that the americans have defeated one of soccers oligarchs at a world cup with both sides trying their best for a victory that by itself would be a precedentsetting result people in oklahoma are beginning to ask questions about why their state has been having so many earthquakes all of a sudden according to the globegazzettecom barbara brown poses for a photo on the front step of her home that now sits about one foot off the surface of her lawn saturday june 21 2014 in reno texas oklahoma city ap — oklahoma residents whose homes and nerves have been shaken by an upsurge in earthquakes want to know whats causing the temblors — and what can be done to stop them hundreds of people are expected to turn out in edmond oklahoma on thursday night for a town hall meeting on the issue earthquakes used to be almost unheard of on the vast stretches of prairie that unfold across texas kansas and oklahoma but theyve become common in recent years oklahoma recorded nearly 150 between january and the start of may though most have been too weak to cause serious damage or endanger lives theyve raised suspicions that the shaking might be connected to the oil and gas drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing especially the wells in which the industry disposes of its wastewater now after years of being harangued by anxious residents governments in all three states are confronting the issue reviewing scientific data holding public discussions and considering new regulations thursdays meeting in oklahoma will include the state agency that regulates oil and gas drilling and the oklahoma geological survey gee do you suppose it could have anything to do with fracking and what about all that wastewater that has to be disposed of in the fracking process from techsonia fracking fluid spills release colloids that pollute groundwater according to a new research wastewater contains substances that bind to pollutants and their release in soil leads to the ground water contamination as they get along with the water when it is soaked by earth in this study flowback fluid from hydraulic fracturing was analyzed colloids are the charged particles and larger than molecules and have the potency to bind to sand grains with the wastewater colloids get released in to the ground water this study was published in the journal of the american chemical society and was conducted by the researchers at the cornell universitys college of agriculture and life sciences this study was done to determine the remaining colloids amounts in groundwater when the above soil got exposed to flowback fliud in a hydrofracking spills ugh one last story scientists have unearthed interesting facts about oldest human faeces show neanderthals ate vegetables found at a dig in spain the ancient excrement showed chemical traces of both meat and plant digestion an earlier view of these early humans as purely meateating has already been partially discredited by plant remains found in their caves and teeth the new paper in the journal plos one claims to offer the best support to date for an omnivorous diet poo is the perfect evidence said ms ainara sistiaga a phd student at the

samesex marriage sexism terry gross woman hating 36 comments good morning a couple of days ago dan murphy of the christian science monitor tweeted a link to a 2013 post he wrote about online misogyny and noted that its only getting worse its refreshing that some men recognize the problem but why is it getting worse this week i doubt if even dan murphy knows whats driving the recent increase in online expressions of woman hatred hint a powerful woman released a memoir on tuesday there are now 552 customer reviews of the book on amazon most written by misogynistic hillaryhaters who obviously have not read even a single paragraph of hillary clintons hard choices we watched it during the 2008 presidential campaign and we always knew it would happen again if hillary dared to run again the truth is that misogyny is even stronger than racism in this country hatred of women is so powerful that even pointing it out can unleash rape and murder threats from dan murphys post from last year about misogyny in the uk guardian columnist hadley freeman got the ball rolling this time by daring to write on tuesday theres been a lot of focus of late on the weirdyweirdos who send rape threats on twitter and rightly so but much of the coverage makes several misguided assumptions first that angry misogynists only communicate on twitter allow me to introduce you to something called reddit second that this is a manversuswoman thing some of the angriest messages ive ever received on the internet have come from women usually telling me how ugly i am lovely to meet you too and third that legislating against rape threats on the internet is a contravention of freedom of speech seeing as legislation against hate speech in the real world has not as far as i know contravened anyones right to freedom of speech this argument makes no sense except maybe to people who make rape threats and whose grasp of logic is perhaps not whipsmart ms freeman soon received a bomb threat on twitter also in the uk last week feminist writer caroline criadoperez and labour party politician stella creasy received rape threats via twitter after ms criadoperez complained to police shed received dozens of sexual threats over the internet a 21year old man was arrested the hillary hate has been building up for awhile now ever since hillary stepped down as secretary of state and the media began shrieking from the dark heart of its collective fear of a woman president–especially this woman i dont know how bad its going to get but im already sick of it i want so much for hillary to stand strong and prevail over the fear and hatred of women that is and will be projected on her for the next couple of years even i fell for it yesterday when we discussed hillarys interview with nprs terry gross i said i thought hillary had sounded defensive when she responded to grosss question about changing her position on samesex marriage luckily for me fannie and janicen were there to point out my mistake i am glad hillary asserted herself and her tone i dont know why terry gross didnt do her homework or why she took the path that lead to the twisting of her comments insisting it was politics hillary wasnt trying to jump her or as the media said hillary was being testy she was being spot on about her response get ready now that her book is out we are going to see underreactions overreactions the ups and and downs and everything else they will thrown into the mix hillary will be up against the ducks the rick perrys who thinks gays are alcoholics the tea party candidate who says the bible tells me to stone gay people to death and rich gohmert who debates at congressional hearings about who is and who is not going to heaven shes been around the block a couple times bb you remember when chris hayes was attacked by a republican woman she hammered his ass and it was all because they disagreed hillary was not being nasty like this woman she handled it well i thought lets get back to hillarys history she was speaking out against the oppression by the uganda bill kill the gays she gave a hell of speech at george university that was early in 2009 did chris and terry forget 2009 when she said on behalf of department of state and usaid i want to congratulate the gays and lesbians in foreign affairs agencies on winning the employee resource group of the year award by out and equal work place it was hillary who changed the policy at the dept state to help provide benefits for same sex partners of those work were in foreign service it was after this that obama followed with other federal agencies obama had been nodding his head while she was actually changing the laws and the records are there for everybody to see terry and chris refused to see hillary clinton also developed policy on transgender employees at the state department she said stand up and be who you are keep in mind she said the struggle for equality is never ever finished and she is right hillary has been advocate for lgbt community for long time she knows that they we are all flustrated because change is slow to come it coming but very slowly it was hillary who marched in pride parade when june was declared pride month she was right there with them while obama was working out chris is getting lazy get up off his ass and speak to those she has helped for many many years janicen june 13 2014 at 1155 am edit i have to disagree that she sounded defensive i think she sounded decisive gross kept stupidly pushing her agenda again and again clinton was polite for as long as humanly possible and then she just had to put the idiot in her place im glad she responded as she did until then she was sounding like a politician once she cold cocked her madame president sounded like a leader thank you my dear friends that is a clear demonstration of the value of a community blog where we can argue share our analyses with each other im so glad we are still hanging in there together now a response to the chorus of media criticism of hillary as testy iow bitchy from jeremy holden at media matters how nprs terry gross created a false impression that hillary clinton stonewalled on marriage equality by repeatedly asking the same question npr correspondent terry gross created the false impression that hillary clinton was stonewalling and dodging over the issue of marriage equality despite the fact that clinton consistently and repeatedly answered gross question as a senator and during her 2008 presidential run clinton supported civil unions for samesex couples and opposed marriage equality in a march 2013 statement she announced that i support marriage for lesbian and gay couples i support it personally and as a matter of policy and law she explained that her travels as secretary of state and her daughters wedding had been key to her changing her opinion on the issue gross central question was whether clinton changed her publicly stated position and supported gay marriage out of political expedience a question she asked seven separate times during an npr interview clinton consistently rejected gross characterization throughout the interview instead saying that her views on the issue changed over time to me it seemed that gross wanted hillary to say that she had always supported samesex marriage but had pretended to oppose it for political reasons of course if hillary had said that she would have been pilloried for lying about her position the truth is as she stated very clearly that hillarys views on samesex marriage changed as she heard the logical arguments for it from lgbt activists–whom she had long supported here is hillarys clear response at the beginning of the exchange terry gross were there positions you believed in as senator but you couldnt publicly support because you felt that it wasnt time yet that the positions would have been too unpopular that the public wasnt ready in regards to lgbt rights and you know i often think that there are politicians who you know in their heart really support it but dont publicly support it hillary clinton well i was fully on board with ending discrimination in the workplace on behalf of the lgbt community i did not support gay marriage when i was in the senate or running for president as you know and as president obama and others held the same position but it for me became an opportunity to do what i could as secretary of state to make the workplace fairer – something i had always supported and spoke out about and then when i was out of the secretary of state position and once again free to comment on domestic matters i very shortly came out in favor of fully equality including gay marriage yet progressives like chris hayes writers at firedoglake and huffington post ripped into hillary for standing up for herself against grosss attempts to twist her responses another defense of hillarys truthfulness–while expressing frustration with her positions–came from the washington posts johnathan capehart gross misunderstanding of hillary clinton on gay marriage the history bears out clintons contention her evolution on marriage equality was as irksome for the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt community as was president obamas but what made obamas evolution especially painful to watch was knowing that as a candidate for state senate in 1996 he unequivocally stated i favor legalizing samesex marriages and would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages as i covered clinton from first lady to senator to presidential candidate i never detected a whiff of that kind of political calculation in her opposition to samesex marriage if anything her march to yes was maddeningly slow heres another interesting example of contrasting views on hillary and her behavior first the uk guardians review of hard choices by david runciman hard choices by hillary clinton review – buttonedup but still revealing if hillary clinton becomes the next american president she wont just be the first woman to hold that office shell be the first secretary of state to get there since james buchanan in 1857 unlike in britain where foreign secretaries and chancellors of the exchequer routinely go on to the top job senior us cabinet positions are not seen as stepping stones to the white house no secretary of the treasury has ever become president cabinet officers are meant to be functionaries people whose job is to make sense of the world presidents are meant to be politicians people whose job is to lead it in this long exhausting faintly robotic but ultimately impressive book hillary makes her pitch to be both according to runciman hillarys book is way too cautious and prosaic but still an amazing story above all what comes through is clintons sheer persistence this is how she does politics by keeping going and totting up the small victories so that they outweigh the defeats unlike obama who still appears to believe that politics is about rational argument and unlike george bush who thought it was about vision hillary believes it is about breaking things down she is a disaggregator who cant see a problem without trying to make it smaller more manageable and only then does she try to fit the pieces back together again peace she tells us doesnt necessarily begin with a grand fanfare sometimes it comes out of the temporary ceasefire that holds just long enough to make a difference part of why this book is so exhausting is its thoroughness she travels the whole world and tells us about the different challenges she faced taking them all seriously early on she quotes approvingly a maxim from deng xiaoping coolly observe calmly deal with things hold your position hide your capacities bide your time accomplish things where possible the us could do worse than having deng as its next president perhaps thats the only option for a powerful woman in the misogynistic rape culture of the us heres feminist writer jessica valenti also from the guardian hillary clintons book is exactly as safe as female politicians are forced to be hillary clintons new book hard choices – a memoir of her time as secretary of state – is finally out and the critical consensus is that its a snore cnns conservative commentator ana navarro called it 50 shades of boring while the networks liberal contributor sally kohn called it safe and dry – and joked that the book should have been called boring choices the new republic criticized its dullness and lack of critical energy politicos mike allen called the 596page book a newsless snore im not exactly sure how actionpacked the minutiae of a diplomats life is supposed to be but the hard choices haters ignore that a safe book was clintons only real choice after all whenever shes hinted at being anything other than measured and guarded clinton has been attacked as hysterical a ballbuster or worse so if people are bored by hard choices they should blame the misogynist expectations of washington not the careful crafting of a seasoned politician when thenpresidential hopeful clinton teared up on the campaign trail in new hampshire in 2008 for example maureen dowd penned a column in the new york times that asked can hillary cry her way back to the white house on cnn glenn beck said after spending decades stripping away all trace of emotion femininity and humanity hillary clinton broke down and actually cried i dont buy the hype on fox news weekly standard editor bill kristol called the emotional moment solipsistic and narcissistic similarly when clinton got into a heated exchange during her benghazi testimony the new york post ran a cover of clinton yelling with her fists clenched the headline no wonder bills afraid any emotion that hillary clinton shows has always been used against her and it has become a kind of standin for the many reasons women are said to be ohsounfit to lead the buildingup of her protective public armor post and potentially prewhite house isnt just smart for clinton personally – its essential for the growing national image of women in politics its clear from reading hard choices that sexism – particularly during clintons 2008 run for president – has taken a toll on her i knew that it arose from cultural and psychological attitudes about womens roles in society but that didnt make it any easier for me and my supporters she writes indeed the frenzy of misogyny was so intense that its hard to imagine enduring it all while vying for the most important job in the world after seeing the racism that has plagued barack obamas presidency–and has if anything increased during his second term–we now know that the misogyny from the media and society as a whole would continue throughout a hillary clinton presidency that is what it will take for a woman to break through that ultimate glass ceiling if we are going to support hillary in her fight to do just that we will need to stay awake and aware of the various forms the efforts to bring her down will take i learned that lesson here yesterday and i will rely on other sky dancers to keep me focused on the ultimate goal i hope ill be strong enough to do the same in return now what else is happening in the world today

are so many jobs these days that dont really pay a living wage in the us that its really astounding fast food workers are among the lowest paid in the country fastfood workers went on strike and protested outside mcdonalds burger king and other restaurants in 60 us cities on thursday in the largest protest of an almost yearlong campaign to raise service sector wages rallies were held in cities from new york to oakland and stretched into the south historically difficult territory for organized labor the striking workers say they want to unionize without retaliation in order to collectively bargain for a living wage they are demanding 15 an hour more than twice the federal minimum of 725 the median wage for frontline fastfood workers is 894 per hour according to an analysis of government data by the national employment law project nelp an advocacy group for lowerwage workers its almost impossible to get by alone said mcdonalds worker rita jennings 37 who was among about 100 protesters who marched in downtown detroit thursday you have to live with somebody to make it rush limbaugh was all agog and demagogue about the striking workers limbaugh if you want a living wage if you dont like what fast food restaurants pay then do something else its just that simple go to a trade school go to another business start your own business maybe the work that you are capable of isnt yet worth 15 an hour at a fastfood restaurant maybe the consumer doesnt want to pay 10 for a big mac so that people working at mcdonalds make 15 an hour its not just a oneway strata you dont just sit there and double what the employees at mcdonalds make and keep the prices the same now you may think this is obvious folks and you may think come on rush youd be amazed at how many people do not understand the pushpull in economics youd be amazed at the number of people who have taken economics courses who think that the truth about headaches is that the boss is a cheap skinflint and wants his employees to starve and wants to screw his customers thats the basis of their understanding and they go from there and they are applauded by leftwing democrat politicians for holding that belief and theyre encouraged to have it now to those of you who like sean from san diego are sympathetic to this demand for the minimum wage at mickey ds to go from 715 or 725 an hour to 15 let me ask you this when you buy a meal do you make sure that youre paying a fair price for it when you walk in there do you ask the employee look am i paying enough here so that you can get a livable wage when you go in and buy a big mac or a quarter pounder with cheese or a double quarter pounder with cheese do you look at the price is and say are you sure that this costs enough that you can make a livable wage or do you just get a little upset when you think its a little too expensive limbaugh was lecturing fast workers on getting a better job as he sat in his mansion with no clue what it is like to work and survive on minimum wage limbaughs lecture was centered around a couple of the republicans favorite falsehoods rush was pretending that there are better jobs out there for minimum wage workers some happy news for married glbt workers the irs and the us treasury will recognize your marriage you get the standard marriage deduction the us department of the treasury and the internal revenue service irs today ruled that samesex couples legally married in jurisdictions that recognize their marriages will be treated as married for federal tax purposes the ruling applies regardless of

showed up to commemorate the march on washington where were they so what was did they do instead well boehner was in jackson hole wyo and had no public events scheduled but he has been headlining gop fundraisers all this month so its a fairly safe to assume that he was raising cash at the time cantor meanwhile was touring an oil field in north dakota the grand forks herald reports cantor hosted by rep kevin cramer rnd met with energy industry and community leaders at a crew camp in williston toured a drilling site and other oilfield locations in the bakken and met with north dakota petroleum council members in watford city cantor praised north dakotas approach to energy development and said the country needs to follow the states example and adopt a national energy policy i hope to be able to tell the president that theres a lot for him to learn here as far as energy production here in america cantor said north dakota seems to have gotten it right the north dakota petroleum council by the way is a lobby group that represents the states oil and gas industry thats what cantor was doing on the day of the march heres a little bit of news on new orleans 8 years after katrina now optimism is rising as a rebounding city approaches the 300th anniversary of its 1718 founding the city is a much better place than it was eight years ago the biggest challenge we have is blight landrieu said adding that 10000 blighted properties have been removed from the cityscape a thriving downtown and newly vibrant neighborhoods contrast starkly with the citys appearance eight years ago when katrina hit thousands of people who couldnt escape new orleans in time were trapped in homes as levees broke and floodwaters rose helicopters plucked the desperate from rooftops as chaos spread the damaged superdome became a refuge of misery for thousands as tempatures and tempers soared days afterward thenpresident george w bush promised the nations full attention but federal authorities were sharply criticized for their early response and local and state authorities as well and though billions of federal dollars have helped to rebuild a strengthened levee system many locals remain bitter with the army corps of engineers for the failure of the levees landrieu said hes intent on moving forward i think that we have successfully done the most important thing which was to think about building the city back the way she should have always been and not the way she was he said landrieu said rebuilding has even meant reorganizing government operations streamlining finances curbing waste and fraud and reorganizing the citys education system – even adding new fire and police stations parks and libraries the weird thing about the blight is that its in areas that you wouldnt necessarily expect to have ramshackled buildings and over grown lots every time i go from my home near the mississippi river towards the lake i see blight on the way it pops up in the newer suburban areas as well as older neighborhoods there are still a lot of eye sores and it appears its going to take a long time for many of them to be torn down or restored thankfully the historic parts of the city appear to be well on the mend unfortunately the infrastructure is so gone in many areas that the blight will remain for some time thats my offering today whats on your reading and blogging

talk recently about russias antigay propaganda legislation–signed into law on june 30 by president vladimir putin–because of this months world athletics championships in moscow and the upcoming winter olympics in sochi as well as edward snowdens decision to defect to russia naturally there is concern about discrimination against gay athletes and coaches at international sporting events and snowden has been criticized because his supposed passion for human rights is belied by his embrace of putin and his disastrous human rights record heres an explanation of the new law at policymic russias antigay law spelled out in plain english on june 30 this year russian president vladimir putin signed into law a bill banning the propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations to minors thus opening a new dark chapter in the history of gay rights in russia the law caps a period of ferocious activities by the russian government aimed at limiting the rights of the countrys lesbian gay bisexual transgender and intersex people the violations of fundamental constitutionally protected rights of russias gay citizens have included multiple bans on gay pride parades in moscow and other cities hefty fines to gay rights groups accused of acting as a foreign agent denial of registration to nongovernmental organizations and regional laws banning the propaganda of homosexuality to minors which served as a basis for the federal law enacted by mr putin and unanimously passed by the state duma against this backdrop violent attacks on gays or suspect gays are becoming commonplace the federal law is spelled out in article 621 of the code of the russian federation on administrative offenses here is what article 621 actually says propaganda is the act of distributing information among minors that 1 is aimed at the creating nontraditional sexual attitudes 2 makes nontraditional sexual relations attractive 3 equates the social value of traditional and nontraditional sexual relations or 4 creates an interest in nontraditional sexual relations if youre russian individuals engaging in such propaganda can be fined 4000 to 5000 rubles 120150 usd public officials are subject to fines of 40000 to 50000 rubles 12001500 usd and registered organizations can be either fined 8000001000000 rubles or 2400030000 usd or sanctioned to stop operations for 90 days if you engage in the said propaganda in the media or on the internet the sliding scale of fines shifts for individuals 50000 to 100000 rubles for public officials 100000 to 200000 rubles and for organizations from one million rubles or a 90day suspension if youre an alien foreign citizens or stateless persons engaging in propaganda are subject to a fine of 4000 to 5000 rubles or they can be deported from the russian federation andor serve 15 days in jail if a foreigner uses the media or the internet to engage in propaganda the fines increase to 50000100000 rubles or a 15day detention with subsequent deportation from russia as policymic points out the language of the law is so ambiguous that it is difficult to predict how it will be enforced or how it will be applied to foreigners according to huffpo visitors to russia should be concerned bad news for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender lgbt travelers hoping to visit russia as foreign tourists will now be subjected to the same gay propaganda fines and sentences as residents travel site skift reports that the new law signed into law by russian president vladimir putin on june 30 contains a provision that allows the government to arrest and detain gay or progay foreigners for up to 14 days before they would then be expelled from russia as far as what is considered progay the laws specifics are somewhat vague but canadian site travel and escape suggests gayaffirmative speech displaying a rainbow flag and samesex partners holding hands are among the prohibited actions a few days later on july 3 putin signed another law that bans adoption of russian children by foreign samesex couples or by any unmarried couple or single parent in a country that recognizes gay marriage today harvey fierstein published an oped in the new york times on russias antigay crackdown in which he reports there are rumors that putin will soon sign an edict that would remove children from their own families if the parents are either gay or lesbian or suspected of being gay or lesbian the police would have the authority to remove children from adoptive homes as well as from their own biological parents fierstein dismisses claims that these recently passed laws are designed to protect children from pedophiles there is no scientific evidence to show that pedophiles are homosexuals in fact research shows that the overwhelming majority of pedophiles are heterosexual males so what is the explanation for the putins war against gays mr putins true motives lie elsewhere historically this kind of scapegoating is used by politicians to solidify their bases and draw attention away from their failing policies and no doubt this is whats happening in russia counting on the natural backlash against the success of marriage equality around the world and recruiting support from conservative religious organizations mr putin has sallied forth into this battle figuring that the only opposition he will face will come from the left his favorite boogeyman mr putins campaign against lesbian gay and bisexual people is one of distraction a strategy of demonizing a minority for political gain taken straight from the nazi playbook can we allow this war against human rights to go unanswered although mr putin may think he can control his creation history proves he can not his condemnations are permission to commit violence against gays and lesbians in may a young gay man was murdered in the city of volgograd he was beaten his body violated with beer bottles his clothing set on fire his head crushed with a rock this is most likely just the beginning yet so far the international community hasnt done much to push back against putins antigay campaign as fierstein writes this must change and the upcoming winter olympics provides the perfect opportunity for enlightened government to put pressure on putin and his regime today one gay reporter james kirchick did his part to call attention to russias repressive new antigay laws when he appeared on russia today the stateowned tv station ostensibly to discuss the bradley manning sentence it turned into quite a scene according to the washington free beacon kirchick was taken off the air when he refused to stop talking about russias antigay laws and focus on bradley manning a quick explanation now for the beginning of our coverage of the bradley manning sentences one host said later in the program we invited a guest on to discuss the fate of the whistleblower but he used the chance to discuss his views on other unrelated issues and thats why we had to take him off air we would like to say sorry for any confusion caused rt also refused to continue kirchicks car service according to the reporter true fact rt just called taxi company that took me to studio to drop me off

            "text": "Marc Ambinder at The Week analyzes the IC official statement, What you need to know about the latest NSA revelations .\n\nYou need to read the entire article to understand Cesca’s article, so please go over there if you’re interested in this issue.\n\nGlenn Greenwald’s “grand finale fireworks display” finally appeared online early Wednesday and, indeed, there were fireworks but not the “spectacular multicolored hues” he  predicted . The fireworks instead came in the form of a bombshell that exploded in a mushroom cloud of shoddy reporting and the usual hyperbolic, misleading accusations that have been the centerpiece of his brand of journalism for more than a year.\n\nFor further reactions to the latest claims from The Intercept and The Washington Post–and to the DNI/DOJ statement, check out  to the following links.\n\nOn the other hand, I’d like to see Congress do a serious investigation of what NSA and other intelligence agencies are actually doing, and particularly I’d like the government to address the issue of whether the five Americans named in Greenwald’s article were actually targeted and why. The supposed targeting happened before 2008, so perhaps it wouldn’t hurt if more information were released about the reasons.\n\nTake from that what you will. The Greenwald cultists simply dismiss statements coming that from the Government as lies, and assume the worst. My tendency is to base my opinions on evidence. So far I haven’t seen evidence in anything coming from the Snowden leaks that NSA is specifically targeting people because of their political and/or religious beliefs. In my opinion the FBI has done this, but Greenwald’s latest article doesn’t even present valid evidence against the FBI.\n\nThe United States is as committed to protecting privacy rights and individual freedom as we are to defending our national security.\n\nOn the other hand, a person who the court finds is an agent of a foreign power under this rigorous standard is not exempted just because of his or her occupation.\n\nNo U.S. person can be the subject of surveillance based solely on First Amendment activities, such as staging public rallies, organizing campaigns, writing critical essays, or expressing personal beliefs.\n\nThese court orders are issued by an independent federal judge only if probable cause, based on specific facts, are established that the person is an agent of a foreign power, a terrorist, a spy, or someone who takes orders from a foreign power.\n\nWith limited exceptions (for example, in an emergency), our intelligence agencies must have a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to target any U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident for electronic surveillance.\n\nUnlike some other nations, the United States does not monitor anyone’s communications in order to suppress criticism or to put people at a disadvantage based on their ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation or religion.\n\nIt is entirely false that U.S. intelligence agencies conduct electronic surveillance of political, religious or activist figures solely because they disagree with public policies or criticize the government, or for exercising constitutional rights.\n\nJoint Statement by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice on Court-ordered Legal Surveillance of U.S. Persons .\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence has released an official statement in response to the  latest article  and statements by Glenn Greenwald that suggest without any supporting evidence that U.S. intelligence agencies are essentially duplicating the illegal actions of  COINTELPRO  from 1956-1971.\n\nIt is time for our state leaders to put the issue behind us so that we can focus on strengthening the middle-class, investing in quality education and rebuilding Indiana’s economy. Hoosier businesses depend on the best and brightest employees to compete in the global economy. Indiana is rolling up the welcome mat with this regressive stance on this issue. Although my opponent has a long history of opposing marriage equality, I call on Mrs. Lawson to reject Governor Pence’s ruling today. The Office of the Secretary of State should be welcoming to all employers choosing to invest or reinvest in Indiana. And that includes their prospective employees and their families. Hoosiers deserve common sense leadership that is focused on moving Indiana forward.”\n\n“As Clerk of Marion County, I was proud our office was able to issue these licenses and officiate over 450 weddings for couples, many of whom have been in loving committed relationships for decades. Governor Pence owes these couples an explanation on why he continues to deem them as second class citizens. They legally obtained their license, paid the requisite fee and should be entitled to the same rights and privileges the rest of us enjoy.\n\n“The State of Indiana must operate in a manner with the laws of Indiana. So we have directed our state agencies earlier this week to conduct themselves in a way that respects current Indiana law, pending this matter’s process through the courts,” Pence said.\n\nPence defended the memo Wednesday and the sentiment expressed in it Wednesday afternoon. He said it was his job as governor to carry out the laws of the State of Indiana.\n\nThe memo from the governor’s chief counsel tells executive branch agencies to execute their functions as though the June 25 court order had not been issued.\n\nAnother Republican Governor  has made an ass of himself   (not for the first time). Indiana Governor Mike Pence has told state agencies to not to honor the hundreds of gay marriages that took place after a federal court in Indianapolis invalidated as unconstitutional Indiana’s law banning same-sex marriages.\n\nWell, it wouldn’t be the first time that right wing Republicans acted against their political best interest.\n\n“If we do that, then we’re going to get blamed for perpetuating the problem,” Graham told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nBut Graham, a long-time supporter of an immigration system overhaul, said a failure to provide the funds will exacerbate the crisis while handing Obama and the Democrats a political victory ahead of November’s midterm elections.\n\nA number of conservatives on Capitol Hill are pushing back hard against President Obama’s  request for almost $4 billion  to manage the spike of immigrants — thousands of them unaccompanied minors — that’s hit the Texas-Mexico border in recent months.\n\nThe most obvious and direct cause of the flood of children from Central America is the 2008 human trafficking law that ended the rapid deportation of unaccompanied minors who come illegally from countries other than Mexico and Canada. The law essentially guarantees long stays for these immigrants by promising them a deportation process that can take 18 months, during which time they are often placed with family members who have little incentive to have the kids show up for hearings.\n\nBut this border crisis, sowed years ago and building for months, is neither a high crime nor a misdemeanor. It’s a humanitarian nightmare in which children, some as young as 4, can face physical and sexual abuse, injury and death in their lonely journeys. What’s upside-down about the Cruz-Palin argument is that this crisis has actually been brought about by Obama following the law.\n\n“President Obama today is down in the state of Texas, but sadly he’s not visiting the border,” said Cruz, in a rare collaboration with McCain. “. . . He’s visiting Democratic fat cats to collect checks, and apparently there’s no time to look at the disaster, at the devastation that’s being caused by his policies. . . . It is a disaster that is the direct consequence of President Obama’s lawlessness.” ….\n\nA querulous quartet of conservatives took to the Senate floor Wednesday….to criticize the president for  failing to visit the border  during his visit to Texas this week, was coordinated by Sen. John McCain and included fellow Arizonan Jeff Flake and both of the chamber’s Texans, Sen. John Cornyn and the man McCain once dubbed a “wacko bird,” Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nAnyway, it doesn’t matter right now. Until we know more about the context, the photo will be a Rorschach test. In the future, there will be Midrash about this photo.\n\nSo, how did President Obama’s meeting with Republican Governor Rick Perry go today? In a statement on Wednesday, Obama described the meeting as “constructive,” but, well, this photo also exists. It’s not immediately clear what the context of this photo was — Is Perry sad? Uncomfortable? Telling a funny story? Happy, but trying to look serious? Hmm. Perhaps someone made a joke at Perry’s expense? Or maybe Perry just makes the Robert De Niro shrug face a lot for no reason.\n\nSo what happened when the two men met? The New York Times reports:  Obama Presses Perry to Rally Support for Border Funds . According to the authors, Jackie Calmes and Ashley Parker, Obama “directly challenged” Perry to convince Congressional Republicans to support $3.7 billion in emergency funds to deal with what Perry has called “a humanitarian crisis” — “thousands of Central American children who have crossed the Mexican border.”\n\nMediaite thinks the photos will doom Perry’s chances for the 2016 Republican nomination; but after his performance in 2012, it seems pretty obvious that Perry himself will destroy his presidential hopes all by himself.\n\nIf Perry was wary of the type of photo-op that has  haunted  Republicans like Governor  Chris Christie (R-NJ), and former Republicans like  Charlie Crist , he can at least be thankful that the president did not try to hug him. Though, he did give him a few friendly pats on the back.\n\nFollowing Perry’s letter, the Obama administration decided to invite the governor to join Obama at a previously scheduled meeting with faith leaders and elected officials in Dallas. Following that concession, Perry  decided he would be comfortable  greeting Obama on the tarmac, though he did not indicate whether he would deign to shake the president’s hand.\n\n“I don’t believe he particularly cares whether or not the border of the United States is secure,” Perry said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” charging the president was either “inept” or had an “ulterior motive” in failing to secure the border.\n\n“At any point while you are here, I am available to sit down privately so we can talk and you may directly gain my state’s perspective on the effects of an unsecured border and what is necessary to make it secure,” Perry wrote the president.\n\nIn a letter to the president, Perry wrote, “I appreciate the offer to greet you at Austin-Bergstrom Airport, but a quick handshake on the tarmac will not allow for a thoughtful discussion regarding the humanitarian and national security crises enveloping the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. I would instead offer to meet with you at any time during your visit to Texas for a substantive meeting to discuss this critical issue. With the appropriate notice, I am willing to change my schedule to facilitate this request.”\n\nGov. Rick Perry Monday turned down what he characterized as President Barack Obama’s offer for a “quick handshake on the tarmac” at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Wednesday, but said he would juggle his schedule to accommodate a “substantive meeting” with the president on the border crisis any time during his two-day visit to Texas.\n\nIt’s been ages since I’ve watched CNN, but it sounds like Wolf and his network are practically outdoing Fox News. Do they not see the racial implications of a Republican Governor resisting shaking hands with an African-American President?\n\nThe anchor betrayed some surprise when Perry walked across the tarmac to greet Obama, shaking his hand and walking side by side to Marine One, where they would have a private meeting about the current crisis at the border.\n\nAs CNN’s  Wolf Blitzer  said while Obama was descending the steps of Air Force One, “I’m anxious to see if the governor Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, is there at the bottom of the stairs to receive the president of the United States.”\n\nGovernor  Rick Perry  (R-TX) was determined not to shake President  Barack Obama’ s hand when he arrived at Dallas-Fort Worth airport on Wednesday. But in the end, it appears he just couldn’t help himself.\n\nYesterday President Obama met with Texas Governor Rick Perry to discuss the so-called “immigration crisis.” Perry had initially  refused to shake hands with the President  as Obama disembarked from Airforce One, but Perry ended up doing it anyway.\n\nNow . . . what stories are you following today?

These early Neanderthals even cooked vegetables and may have used plants for medicinal purposes. Read the whole article at the link. It’s fascinating.\n\nMs Sistiaga and her colleagues collected a number of samples from the remnants of a 50,000-year-old campfire in the El Salt dig site, a known Neanderthal habitation near Alicante on Spain’s Mediterranean coast.\n\nPoo is “the perfect evidence,” said Ms Ainara Sistiaga, a PhD student at the University of La Laguna on the Canary Islands, and the study’s first author, “because you’re sure it was consumed”.\n\nThe new paper, in the journal  PLOS One , claims to offer the best support to date for an omnivorous diet.\n\nAn earlier view of these early humans as purely meat-eating has already been partially discredited by plant remains found in their caves and teeth.\n\nThis study was done to determine the remaining colloids amounts in groundwater when the above soil got exposed to flowback fliud in a hydrofracking spills.\n\nThis study was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society and was conducted by the researchers at the Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.\n\nIn this study, flowback fluid from hydraulic fracturing was analyzed. Colloids are the charged particles and larger than molecules and have the potency to bind to sand grains. With the wastewater, colloids get released in to the ground water.\n\nAccording to a new research, wastewater contains substances that bind to pollutants and their release in soil leads to the ground water contamination as they get along with the water when it is soaked by earth.\n\nGee, do you suppose it could have anything to do with fracking? And what about all that wastewater that has to be disposed of in the fracking process? From Techsonia:  Fracking Fluid Spills release Colloids that Pollute Groundwater .\n\nNow after years of being harangued by anxious residents, governments in all three states are confronting the issue, reviewing scientific data, holding public discussions and considering new regulations. Thursday’s meeting in Oklahoma will include the state agency that regulates oil and gas drilling and the Oklahoma Geological Survey.\n\nOklahoma recorded nearly 150 between January and the start of May. Though most have been too weak to cause serious damage or endanger lives, they’ve raised suspicions that the shaking might be connected to the oil and gas drilling method known as hydraulic fracturing, especially the wells in which the industry disposes of its wastewater.\n\nEarthquakes used to be almost unheard of on the vast stretches of prairie that unfold across Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma, but they’ve become common in recent years.\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Oklahoma residents whose homes and nerves have been shaken by an upsurge in earthquakes want to know what’s causing the temblors — and what can be done to stop them.\n\nabout why their state has been having so many earthquakes all of a sudden, according to the Globe-Gazzette.com.\n\nJust as important, a win would mean that the Americans have defeated one of soccer’s oligarchs at a World Cup, with both sides trying their best for a victory. That by itself would be a precedent-setting result.\n\nBefore the tournament, most people thought it would be an unlikely success for the U.S. just to get out of the so-called Group of Death and to the Round of 16. Now, after beating Ghana and dominating much of the game against Portugal, the U.S. can dream bigger. Beat Germany, and America wins its group for the second straight World Cup, a result nearly unthinkable when the draw was announced in December. Beat Germany, and the U.S. secures a favorable Round of 16 match most likely against Algeria or Russia, rather than a trickier faceoff with sneaky-good Belgium.\n\nAll the focus on permutations and goal-differential scenarios has undercut the importance of today’s game for American soccer. There’s not as much at stake, goes the implication, because we can move ahead even if we lose to Germany. But this is about more than getting to the next round. This is an opportunity for the U.S. to face one of soccer’s elite teams on the biggest stage and prove it can hang with—even beat—any country in this World Cup.\n\nIn the wake of the U.S. team’s  heartbreaking come-from-ahead draw  against Portugal in the World Cup on Sunday, soccer analysts and Twitter users scrambled to figure out the many ways the U.S. can still get to the next round. With a three-point lead over Portugal and Ghana in Group G, the Americans can advance even if they lose their match against Germany at noon Eastern today, depending on the outcome of the Portugal-Ghana game played at the same time. Deadspin has one of the better  graphical breakdown s of every potential scenario for the U.S., including the dreaded  drawing of lots .\n\n“By the way, you should act like a good leader and take the day off as well. Go USA! Signed Jurgen Klinsmann, Head Coach, U.S. National team”.\n\n“The #USMNT (U.S. Men’s National Team) has a critical World Cup game vs Germany and we will need the full support of the nation if we are to advance to the next round.\n\n“I understand that this absence may reduce the productivity of your workplace, but I can assure you that it is for an important cause,” wrote Klinsmann.\n\nKlinsman suggested that U.S. fans should take a day off work to watch the game, and wrote a letter to bosses asking them to excuse their employee’s absences, reports Reuters.\n\n“I think some people might be a little bit surprised at our results so far,” coach Jurgen Klinsmann said Wednesday. “We are by no means any underdog here in this tournament, but we know it’s the biggest hurdle we have to take now with Germany.”\n\nTeam USA began their World Cup run in the so-called “group of death,” but their aggression, attacks and overall stamina on the pitch have defied pundits who originally dismissed their chances of advancing.\n\n“This is the biggest game of a lot of our lives, so any fatigue in our legs will be erased,” said American midfielder Kyle Beckerman. “We’ve got to give everything we’ve got and more.”\n\nIt’s been a roller coaster ride for the American team so far in the  World Cup . The team that, on paper, many pundits didn’t expect to advance, now has a real shot at moving on to the second round. And as CBS News’ Elaine Quijano reports, that fate is hinged on beating or at least coming up even against one of the cup favorites, Germany.\n\n“A number of states, including my home state of Maine, have now legalized same-sex marriage, and I agree with that decision,” Collins said in a statement, adding later: “I have long opposed efforts to impose a federal ban on same-sex marriage. In both 2004 and 2006, I voted against amendments to the United States Constitution that would have banned same-sex marriages by preempting state laws.”\n\n“The Indiana ruling invalidating its ban today also used similar reasoning,” Tobias says. “All courts are finding that the bans violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th amendment.”\n\n“The 4th Circuit [in Virginia] may well apply the reasoning of the 10th Circuit opinion, as will numerous district courts that have yet to rule,” he says.\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, writes NPR in an email that the Utah decision “is very significant, as [it is] the first appellate court to address the marriage equality issue.\n\nIn Indiana, Young wrote: “Same-sex couples, who would otherwise qualify to marry in Indiana, have the right to marry in Indiana. … These couples, when gender and sexual orientation are taken away, are in all respects like the family down the street. The Constitution demands that we treat them as such.”\n\n“It is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples,” the three-judge panel in the Utah case said. The panel immediately put the ruling on hold pending its appeal, either to the entire 10th Circuit or directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, according to The Associated Press.\n\nUtah and  Indiana  are the latest states to see their bans on same-sex marriage struck down by a federal court, following rulings in both states Wednesday that found the prohibition unconstitutional.\n\nThe seafloor search, he said, should start around August and be completed within one year. The area is 58 miles wide and 400 miles long, covering an area as big as Lake Huron, the second-largest of the U.S. Great Lakes. By comparison, the area searched with a robotic, sonar-equipped submarine in May was about 330 square miles.\n\nAustralia Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the search was continuing with a mapping of the ocean floor in the newly defined area, to be followed by a comprehensive seafloor search.\n\nThe new zone, about 1,100 miles west of Perth, Australia, is farther south than where previous intensive search efforts were carried out this spring after the plane vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard. The flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it went missing….\n\nExperts from Boeing and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board were among the specialists who helped define the zone, based on satellite data and analysis of previous similar incidents.\n\n“Given these observations, the final stages of the unresponsive crew/hypoxia event type appeared to best fit the available evidence for the final period of MH370’s flight when it was heading in a generally southerly direction,” the document said.\n\nEvidence for an unresponsive crew as the plane flew south includes the loss of radio communications, a long period with no maneuvering of the aircraft, a steadily maintained cruise altitude and eventual fuel exhaustion and descent, the report said.\n\nPilots are trained to put on oxygen masks immediately if an aircraft suffers depressurization; their masks have an hour’s air supply, compared with only a few minutes for the passengers. The plane, which left Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, bound for Beijing, with 239 people aboard, made its turn south toward the Indian Ocean about an hour after it stopped responding to air-traffic controllers….\n\nA report issued by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, outlining how the new search zone had been chosen, said that the most likely scenario as the aircraft headed south across the Indian Ocean on March 8 was that the crew was suffering from hypoxia or was otherwise unresponsive.\n\nBut exactly why the autopilot would have been set on a flight path so far off course from the jet’s destination of Beijing, and exactly when it was switched on remains unknown.\n\nAsked whether the autopilot would have to be manually switched on, or whether it could have been activated automatically under a default setting, Dolan replied, “The basic assumption would be that if the autopilot is operational it’s because it’s been switched on.”\n\n“Certainly for its path across the Indian Ocean, we are confident that the aircraft was operating on autopilot until it ran out of fuel,” Dolan told reporters in Canberra, the nation’s capital.\n\nAfter analyzing data exchanged between the plane and a satellite, officials believe Flight 370 was on autopilot the entire time it was flying across a vast expanse of the southern Indian Ocean, based on the straight path it took, Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Martin Dolan said.\n\nSYDNEY, Australia — Investigators looking into the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines plane are confident it was on autopilot when it crashed in a remote stretch of the Indian Ocean, Australian officials said Thursday as they announced the latest shift in the search for the jet.\n\nA couple of days ago, Dan Murphy of The Christian Science Monitor tweeted a link to a 2013 post he wrote about on-line misogyny and noted that “It’s only getting worse.” It’s refreshing that some men recognize the problem. But why is it “getting worse” this week? I doubt if even Dan Murphy knows what’s driving the recent increase in on-line expressions of woman hatred.\n\nHint: A powerful woman released a memoir on Tuesday. There are now 552 customer reviews of the book on Amazon, most written by misogynistic Hillary-haters who obviously have not read even a single paragraph of Hillary Clinton’s Hard Choices.\n\nWe watched it during the 2008 presidential campaign, and we always knew it would happen again if Hillary dared to run again. The truth is that misogyny is even stronger than racism in this country; hatred of women is so powerful that even pointing it out can unleash rape and murder threats. From Dan Murphy’s post from last year about misogyny in the UK:\n\nThe Hillary hate has been building up for awhile now, ever since Hillary stepped down as Secretary of State and the media began shrieking from the dark heart of its collective fear of a woman president–especially *This Woman.* I don’t know how bad its going to get, but I’m already sick of it. I want so much for Hillary to stand strong and prevail over the fear and hatred of women that is and will be projected on her for the next couple of years.\n\nEven I fell for it yesterday when we discussed Hillary’s interview with NPR’s Terry Gross. I said I thought Hillary had sounded defensive when she responded to Gross’s question about changing her position on same-sex marriage. Luckily for me, Fannie and Janicen were there to point out my mistake:\n\nI am glad Hillary asserted herself and her tone. I don’t know why Terry Gross didn’t do her homework, or why she took the path that lead to the “twisting of her comments, insisting it was politics”. Hillary wasn’t trying to jump her (or as the media said, Hillary was being testy), she was being spot on about her response. Get ready, now that her book is out, we are going to see underreactions, overreactions, the ups and and downs, and everything else they will thrown into the mix. Hillary will be up against the Ducks, the Rick Perry’s who thinks gays are alcoholics, the tea party candidate who says the Bible tells me to stone gay people to death, and Rich Gohmert who debates at congressional hearings about who is and who is not going to heaven. She’s been around the block a couple times. BB, you remember when Chris Hayes was attacked by a republican woman, she hammered his ass, and it was all because they “disagreed”. Hillary was NOT being nasty like this woman. She handled it well, I thought. Let’s get back to Hillary’s history. She was speaking out against the oppression by the Uganda Bill “Kill the Gays”. She gave a hell of speech at George University. That was early in 2009. Did Chris and Terry forget 2009 when she said:\n\n “On behalf of Department of State and USAID, I want to congratulate the gays and lesbians in foreign affairs agencies on winning the Employee Resource Group of the Year Award by Out and Equal Work Place.” It was Hillary who changed the policy at the Dept. State, to help provide benefits for same sex partners of those work were in foreign service. It was after this that Obama followed with other federal agencies. Obama had been nodding his head, while she was actually changing the laws, and the records are there for everybody to see. Terry and Chris refused to see. Hillary Clinton also developed policy on transgender employees at the state department. She said stand up and be who you are. Keep in mind, she said “the struggle for equality is never ever finished”…. and she is right. Hillary has been advocate for LGBT community for long time. She knows that they (we) are all flustrated because change is slow to come. It coming but very slowly. It was Hillary who marched in Pride Parade when June was declared Pride Month, she was right there with them, while Obama was working out. Chris is getting lazy, get up off his ass and speak to those she has helped for many many years. I have to disagree that she sounded defensive. I think she sounded decisive. Gross kept stupidly pushing her agenda again and again. Clinton was polite for as long as humanly possible and then she just had to put the idiot in her place. I’m glad she responded as she did. Until then she was sounding like a politician. Once she cold cocked her, Madame President sounded like a leader.\n\nThank you, my dear friends. That is a clear demonstration of the value of a community blog where we can argue share our analyses with each other. I’m so glad we are still hanging in there together!\n\nNow a response to the chorus of media criticism of Hillary as “testy” (IOW *bitchy*) from Jeremy Holden at Media Matters: How NPR’s Terry Gross Created A False Impression That Hillary Clinton Stonewalled On Marriage Equality.\n\nTo me it seemed that Gross wanted Hillary to say that she had always supported same-sex marriage, but had pretended to oppose it for political reasons. Of course if Hillary had said that, she would have been pilloried for lying about her position. The truth is, as she stated very clearly, that Hillary’s views on same-sex marriage changed as she heard the logical arguments for it from LGBT activists–whom she had long supported. Here is Hillary’s clear response at the beginning of the exchange.\n\nTERRY GROSS: Were there positions you believed in as senator but you couldn’t publicly support because you felt that it wasn’t time yet? That the positions would have been too unpopular? That the public wasn’t ready in regards to LGBT rights? And, you know, I often think that there are politicians who, you know, in their heart really support it but don’t publicly support it. HILLARY CLINTON: Well, I was fully on board with ending discrimination in the workplace on behalf of the LGBT community. I did not support gay marriage when I was in the Senate or running for president, as you know, and as President Obama and others held the same position.But it, for me, became an opportunity to do what I could as secretary of state to make the workplace fairer – something I had always supported and spoke out about. And then when I was out of the secretary of state position and once again free to comment on domestic matters, I very shortly came out in favor of fully equality, including gay marriage.\n\nYet “progressives” like Chris Hayes writers at Firedoglake and Huffington Post ripped into Hillary for standing up for herself against Gross’s attempts to twist her responses.\n\nAnother defense of Hillary’s truthfulness–while expressing frustration with her positions–came from the Washington Post’s Johnathan Capehart: Gross misunderstanding of Hillary Clinton on gay marriage.\n\nHere’s another interesting example of contrasting views on Hillary and her behavior. First The UK Guardian’s review of Hard Choices by David Runciman: Hard Choices by Hillary Clinton review – buttoned-up but still revealing.\n\nAccording to Runciman, Hillary’s book is way too cautious and “prosaic,” but still “an amazing story.\n\nAbove all, what comes through is Clinton’s sheer persistence. This is how she does politics, by keeping going and totting up the small victories so that they outweigh the defeats. Unlike Obama, who still appears to believe that politics is about rational argument, and unlike George Bush, who thought it was about vision, Hillary believes it is about breaking things down. She is a disaggregator, who can’t see a problem without trying to make it smaller, more manageable, and only then does she try to fit the pieces back together again. Peace, she tells us, doesn’t necessarily begin with a grand fanfare. Sometimes it comes out of the temporary ceasefire that holds just long enough to make a difference. Part of why this book is so exhausting is its thoroughness: she travels the whole world and tells us about the different challenges she faced, taking them all seriously. Early on she quotes approvingly a maxim from Deng Xiaoping: “Coolly observe, calmly deal with things, hold your position, hide your capacities, bide your time, accomplish things where possible.” The US could do worse than having Deng as its next president.\n\nPerhaps that’s the only option for a powerful woman in the misogynistic rape culture of the U.S.?\n\nHere’s feminist writer Jessica Valenti, also from The Guardian: Hillary Clinton’s book is exactly as ‘safe’ as female politicians are forced to be.\n\nHillary Clinton’s new book, Hard Choices – a memoir of her time as secretary of state – is finally out, and the critical consensus is that it’s a snore. CNN’s conservative commentator Ana Navarro called it “50 shades of boring” while the network’s liberal contributor Sally Kohn called it “safe” and “dry” – and joked that the book should have been called “Boring Choices“. The New Republic criticized its “dullness and lack of critical energy”. Politico’s Mike Allen called the 596-page book a “newsless snore”. I’m not exactly sure how action-packed the minutiae of a diplomat’s life is supposed to be, but the Hard Choices haters ignore that a “safe” book was Clinton’s only real choice. After all, whenever she’s hinted at being anything other than measured and guarded, Clinton has been attacked as hysterical, a ballbuster or worse. So if people are bored by Hard Choices, they should blame the misogynist expectations of Washington, not the careful crafting of a seasoned politician. When then-presidential hopeful Clinton teared up on the campaign trail in New Hampshire in 2008, for example, Maureen Dowd penned a column in the New York Times that asked “Can Hillary Cry Her Way Back to the White House?”On CNN, Glenn Beck said, “After spending decades stripping away all trace of emotion, femininity, and humanity, Hillary Clinton broke down and actually cried. … I don’t buy the hype.” On Fox News, Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol called the emotional moment “solipsistic and narcissistic”. Similarly, when Clinton got into a heated exchange during her Benghazi testimony, the New York Post ran a cover of Clinton yelling with her fists clenched; the headline: NO WONDER BILL’S AFRAID. Any emotion that Hillary Clinton shows has always been used against her, and it has become a kind of stand-in for the many reasons women are said to be oh-so-unfit to lead. The building-up of her protective public armor, post- and potentially pre-White House, isn’t just smart for Clinton personally – it’s essential for the growing national image of women in politics. It’s clear from reading Hard Choices that sexism – particularly during Clinton’s 2008 run for president – has taken a toll on her. “I knew that it arose from cultural and psychological attitudes about women’s roles in society, but that didn’t make it any easier for me and my supporters,” she writes. Indeed, the frenzy of misogyny was so intense that it’s hard to imagine enduring it all while vying for the most important job in the world.\n\nAfter seeing the racism that has plagued Barack Obama’s presidency–and has, if anything, increased during his second term–we now know that the misogyny from the media and society as a whole would continue throughout a Hillary Clinton presidency. That is what it will take for a woman to break through that ultimate glass ceiling. If we are going to support Hillary in her fight to do just that we will need to stay awake and aware of the various forms the efforts to bring her down will take. I learned that lesson here yesterday, and I will rely on other Sky Dancers to keep me focused on the ultimate goal. I hope I’ll be strong enough to do the same in return.\n\nNow, what else is happening in the world today? Please post your thoughts and links on any topic in the comment thread.",

important judicial ruling yet among a steady stream of court decisions that in the past year have invalidated state laws banning samesex marriages or recognition of such marriages performed in other states the decision was issued on the same day that a federal judge in indiana struck down that states ban on samesex marriage becoming the 10th federal judge to invalidate a state ban in the past six months taken together wednesdays decisions give even greater momentum to gay rights activists seeking an eventual decision at the us supreme court mandating samesex marriage be made legal coasttocoast a prime part of the history of our constitution is the story of the extension of constitutional rights and protections to people once ignored or excluded circuit judge carlos lucero wrote in the 10th circuit decision quoting a 1996 us supreme court case consistent with our constitutional tradition of recognizing the liberty of those previously excluded we conclude that gay and lesbian plaintiffs possess a fundamental right to marry and to have their marriages recognized he wrote in an opinion joined by judge jerome holmes in a dissent judge paul kelly criticized the majority for deciding an important issue of constitutional law without waiting for clear guidance from the us supreme court we should resist the temptation to become philosopherkings imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the fourteenth amendment he said the appeals court said it would maintain an existing stay on the case until the legal dispute was resolved the 65page decision and 21page dissent were handed down on the eve of the oneyear anniversary of the supreme courts decision in us v windsor striking down the federal defense of marriage act the action at the denverbased tenth us circuit court of appeals sets the stage for an expected appeal by utah officials to the supreme court and a potential constitutional showdown over samesex marriage it is the first of what may become several appeals court decisions likely to rise to the high court those cases will give the justices an opportunity to rule whether there is a fundamental right to marry regardless of sexual orientation or whether it will remain up to the states to define marriage the same tenth circuit panel also heard an appeal filed after a federal judge in oklahoma struck down that states ban on samesex marriages a decision in that case is pending in addition a decision is also pending from a panel of the third circuit in richmond concerning the constitutionality of virginias ban on samesex marriage in the utah case the appeals court found that because the right to marry is a fundamental right under the constitution the state would have to overcome the strictest judicial scrutiny to justify its ban on samesex marriage utah officials had argued that the states definition of marriage was intended to advance state interests in fostering a culture of childcentric marriage in which children would be conceived and raised by their married biological mother and father together in the same home the state also argued that retaining the existing definition of marriage was necessary to avoid civic strife and a threat to religious freedom judge lucero said none of the rationales satisfied the requisite level of scrutiny several recent district court decisions have rejected nearly identical state attempts to justify samesex marriage bans based on procreative concerns he said he added a states interest in developing and sustaining committed relationships between childbearing couples is simply not connected to its recognition of samesex marriages lucero said the court could not imagine a scenario in which recognizing samesex marriages would affect the decision of an oppositesex couple to have a child marry or stay married instead of ripping the institution apart adding new couples to the ranks of the married would help sustain it and build it up he said rather than being mutually exclusive of the procreative potential of marriage these freedoms – to choose ones spouse to decide whether to conceive or adopt a child to publicly proclaim an enduring commitment to remain together through thick and thin – reinforce the childrearing family structure the judge wrote such freedoms support the dignity of each person he said lucero rejected state arguments that judges should respect democratic decisionmaking such as the 66 percent of utah voters who approved the states oneman onewoman definition of marriage he also swept aside arguments that the court should recognize that under the nations system of federalism it has traditionally been within the authority of the states to regulate marriage as a matter of policy it might be preferable to allow the national debate on samesex marriage to play out through legislative and democratic channels he said but the judiciary is not empowered to pick and choose the timing of its decisions lucero said he added the protection and exercise of fundamental rights are not matters for opinion polls or the ballot box in his dissent judge kelly said the regulation of marriage is a power reserved to the states and that the state of utah had offered a rational and acceptable justification for retaining its traditional definition of marriage while the court has recognized a fundamental right to marriage every decision vindicating that right has involved two persons of the opposite gender he said if the states are the laboratories of democracy requiring every state to recognize samegender unions – contrary to the views of its electorate and representatives – turns the notion of a limited national government on its head the judge said kelly said key portions of luceros decision involved areas of the law upon which the supreme court had not yet ruled at best the developments relied upon are ambiguous and certainly do not compel the conclusion that the supreme court will interpret the fourteenth amendment to require every state to extend marriage to samegender couples regardless of contrary state law he wrote he said the appeals court was misreading the supreme courts windsor decision windsor did not create a fundamental right to samegender marriage he said to the contrary windsor recognized the authority of the states to redefine marriage and stressed the need for popular consensus in making such change",

Those cases will give the justices an opportunity to rule whether there is a fundamental right to marry regardless of sexual orientation or whether it will remain up to the states to define marriage.\n\nThe same Tenth Circuit panel also heard an appeal filed after a federal judge in Oklahoma struck down that state’s ban on same-sex marriages. A decision in that case is pending.\n\nIn addition, a decision is also pending from a panel of the Third Circuit in Richmond concerning the constitutionality of Virginia’s ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nIn the Utah case, the appeals court found that because the right to marry is a fundamental right under the Constitution, the state would have to overcome the strictest judicial scrutiny to justify its ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nUtah officials had argued that the state’s definition of marriage was intended to advance state interests in fostering a culture of child-centric marriage in which children would be conceived and raised by their married biological mother and father together in the same home.\n\nThe state also argued that retaining the existing definition of marriage was necessary to avoid civic strife and a threat to religious freedom.\n\nJudge Lucero said none of the rationales satisfied the requisite level of scrutiny.\n\n“Several recent district court decisions have rejected nearly identical state attempts to justify same-sex marriage bans based on procreative concerns,” he said.\n\nHe added: “A state’s interest in developing and sustaining committed relationships between childbearing couples is simply not connected to its recognition of same-sex marriages.” Lucero said the court could not imagine a scenario in which recognizing same-sex marriages would affect the decision of an opposite-sex couple to have a child, marry, or stay married.\n\nInstead of ripping the institution apart, adding new couples to the ranks of the married would help sustain it and build it up, he said.\n\n“Rather than being mutually exclusive of the procreative potential of marriage, these freedoms – to choose one’s spouse, to decide whether to conceive or adopt a child, to publicly proclaim an enduring commitment to remain together through thick and thin – reinforce the childrearing family structure,” the judge wrote.\n\n“Such freedoms support the dignity of each person,” he said.\n\nLucero rejected state arguments that judges should respect democratic decision-making, such as the 66 percent of Utah voters who approved the state’s one-man, one-woman definition of marriage. He also swept aside arguments that the court should recognize that under the nation’s system of federalism it has traditionally been within the authority of the states to regulate marriage.\n\n“As a matter of policy, it might be preferable to allow the national debate on same-sex marriage to play out through legislative and democratic channels,” he said.\n\n“But the judiciary is not empowered to pick and choose the timing of its decisions,” Lucero said.\n\nHe added: “The protection and exercise of fundamental rights are not matters for opinion polls or the ballot box.”\n\nIn his dissent, Judge Kelly said the regulation of marriage is a power reserved to the states and that the State of Utah had offered a rational and acceptable justification for retaining its traditional definition of marriage.\n\n“While the court has recognized a fundamental right to marriage, every decision vindicating that right has involved two persons of the opposite gender,” he said.\n\n“If the states are the laboratories of democracy, requiring every state to recognize same-gender unions – contrary to the views of its electorate and representatives – turns the notion of a limited national government on its head,” the judge said.\n\nKelly said key portions of Lucero’s decision involved areas of the law upon which the Supreme Court had not yet ruled.\n\n“At best, the developments relied upon are ambiguous and certainly do not compel the conclusion that the Supreme Court will interpret the Fourteenth Amendment to require every state to extend marriage to same-gender couples, regardless of contrary state law,” he wrote.\n\nHe said the appeals court was misreading the Supreme Court’s Windsor decision. “Windsor did not create a fundamental right to same-gender marriage,” he said.\n\n“To the contrary, Windsor recognized the authority of the states to redefine marriage and stressed the need for popular consensus in making such change.”",

            "text": "The mechanism of this destruction is not explained. Somehow, if gay people get married, straight people will not be able to. It’s some sort of alchemy understood only by the Religious Right. We are apparently just supposed to trust them on this.\n\nWe are also told that marriage equality is an attack on religious freedom, that religious freedom is somehow denying to others rights you yourself enjoy. Another bit of twisted logic only the Religious Right understands. But the courts are not fooled as marriage bans are struck down in state after state.\n\nYesterday, the Tenth Circuit Court by a 2 – 1 decision dismantled – not struck down but dismantled – Utah’s ban on marriage equality, specifically addressing claims based on ideas of religious freedom (PDF):\n\nAppellants’ fourth and final justification for Amendment 3, “accommodating religious freedom and reducing the potential for civic strife,” fails for reasons independent of the foregoing. Appellants contend that a prohibition on same-sex marriage “is essential to preserving social harmony in the State” and that allowing same-sex couples to marry “would create the potential for religion-related strife.” Even assuming that appellants are correct in predicting that some substantial degree of discord will follow state recognition of same-sex marriage, the Supreme Court has repeated held that public opposition cannot provide cover for a violation of fundamental rights.\n\nSo whether you want them to or not, other people have the same rights you do. That anyone can argue with this assertion in the face of the Declaration’s preamble that “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,” beggars belief.\n\nAppellants acknowledge that a state may not “invoke concerns about religious freedom or religion-related social strife as a basis for denying rights otherwise guaranteed by the Constitution.” But they argue that the social and religious strife argument qualifies as legitimate because a fundamental right is not at issue in this case. Because we have rejected appellants’ contention on this point, their fourth justification necessarily fails. We also emphasize, as did the district court, that today’s decision relates solely to civil marriage. See Kitchen, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 1214 (“[T]he court notes that its decision does not mandate any change for religious institutions, which may continue to express their own moral viewpoints and define their own traditions about marriage.”). Plaintiffs must be accorded the same legal status presently granted to married couples, but religious institutions remain as free as they always have been to practice their sacraments and traditions as they see fit.\n\nThis seems self-evident. Nobody is stopping people from enjoying “traditional” marriage. That can continue as long as hetero couples want to get married.\n\nAnother claim made is that traditional marriage has always been – through all of human history – as we find it now: one man + one woman. Ben Carson repeated this one the other day, saying that marriage equality is like insisting 2+2=5:\n\nThe Tenth Circuit Court kicked this one under the bus as well:\n\nThe court reasonably pointed to the example of interracial marriage:\n\nAppellants’ reliance on the modifier “definitional” does not serve a meaningful function in this context. To claim that marriage, by definition, excludes certain couples is simply to insist that those couples may not marry because they have historically been denied the right to do so. One might just as easily have argued that interracial couples are by definition excluded from the institution of marriage. But “neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack.” Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 577-78 (quotation omitted); see also Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 239 (1970) (“[N]either the antiquity of a practice nor the fact of steadfast legislative and judicial adherence to it through the centuries insulates it from constitutional attack . . . .”); In re Marriage Cases, 183 P.3d 384, 451 (Cal. 2008) (“[E]ven the most familiar and generally accepted of social practices and traditions often mask an unfairness and inequality that frequently is not recognized or appreciated by those not directly harmed by those practices or traditions.”), superseded by constitutional amendment as stated in Strauss v. Horton, 207 P.3d 48, 59 (Cal. 2009).\n\nTony Perkins for one says he is not going to be fooled by a liberally biased reality and a measly bunch of facts:\n\nPerkins continues to insist on the Religious Right’s own personal interpretation of “natural law” and judges who refuse to play along must necessarily be “black robed tyrants” and the Tenth Circuit a “rogue court.”\n\nWhile judges can, by judicial fiat, declare same-sex ‘marriage’ legal, they will never be able to make it right. The courts, for all their power, can’t overturn natural law. What they can do is incite a movement of indignant Americans, who are tired of seeing the foundations of a free and just society destroyed by a handful of black-robed tyrants. The Left has long believed packing the federal courts with liberal jurists is the means of fulfilling a radical social agenda, as the American people refuse to endorse that agenda at the polls or through their elected representatives.\n\nTalk about burying your head in a hole in the ground to avoid facts…\n\nPerkins defiantly calls for civil disobedience for the right to deprive others of their rights:\n\nThe Religious Right does not get it.

It becomes law in the six states covered by the 10th Circuit: Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. But the panel immediately put the ruling on hold pending an appeal.\n\nThe Utah attorney general’s office planned to appeal, but it was assessing whether to go directly to the U.S. Supreme Court or ask the entire 10th Circuit to review the ruling, spokeswoman Missy Larsen said.\n\nWednesday’s decision “takes us one step closer to reaching certainty and finality,” the office said in a statement.\n\nAfter the ruling, the couples named in the appeal hugged, cried and exchanged kisses at a news conference outside their attorney’s offices in downtown Salt Lake City.\n\n“This decision is an absolute victory for fairness and equality for all families in Utah, in every state in the 10th Circuit and every state in this great nation of the United States,” said their attorney, Peggy Tomsic.\n\nPlaintiff Derek Kitchen said he and his partner, Moudi Sbeity, are “so proud to be a part of history.”\n\nLater, about 300 people rallied in support of the ruling at a Salt Lake City park where rainbow flags and colorful signs were displayed proudly.\n\n“It’s an incredible day,” said Chris Johnson, who married his partner, David Tuma, in December while gay marriage was briefly legal in Utah. “We met 19 years ago.

            "text": "A federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled for the first time that states must allow gay couples to marry, finding that same-sex unions are protected under the Constitution and bringing a remarkable legal winning streak across the country one step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union,\" the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver said in its decision.\n\nThe three-judge panel found it \"wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of the love and commitment between same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples.\"\n\nThe decision upheld a lower court ruling that struck down Utah's gay marriage ban. However, the 10th Circuit panel immediately put Wednesday's ruling on hold so it could be appealed, either to the entire 10th Circuit or directly to the nation's highest court.\n\n\"All I can say is that we are thrilled,\" said Kody Partridge, one of the Utah plaintiffs. She was working in the garden with her wife, Laurie Wood, when they heard about the ruling.\n\n\"This is such a historic thing, not just for Utah but for Laurie and me\" and plaintiffs across the country, Partridge said. \"This is a big day.\"\n\nThe decision gives increased momentum to a legal cause that already compiled an impressive record in the lower courts after the Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates.\n\nThe latest of those rulings was in Indiana, where a federal judge on Wednesday struck down that state's same-sex marriage ban in a ruling that immediately allows gay couples to wed.\n\nTwo of the most striking lower court rulings were in the conservative states of Utah and Oklahoma, which saw their voter-approved gay marriage bans overturned in December and January, respectively. In Utah, more than 1,000 same-sex couples wed before the Supreme Court issued a stay.\n\nThe 10th Circuit panel considered both cases. It did not rule on the Oklahoma ban.\n\nThough the Utah and Oklahoma cases have been closely watched, it is unclear whether they will be the first to reach the Supreme Court. The high court could choose from cases moving through five other federal appellate courts, and wouldn't consider a case until next year at the earliest.\n\nAttorneys representing Utah and Oklahoma argued that voters have the right to define marriage in their states. Gay rights lawyers countered that they cannot do so in a way that deprives gay people of their fundamental rights.\n\nThe appellate ruling comes 42 years after the Supreme Court declined to hear a case of two men who were refused a marriage license in Minnesota, finding there was no legal issue for the justices to consider, and just 10 years after 11 states voted to outlaw gay marriage.\n\nNow same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Recent polls show a majority of Americans support it.",

They are among the six same-sex couples listed as plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Louisiana to recognize same-sex marriages.\n\nAttorneys and supporters filled U.S. District Court in downtown New Orleans June 25 to hear arguments for and against Louisiana's refusal to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages. After more than an hour of oral arguments over recognition of those marriages, U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman surprised the courtroom when he declared he would not make a \"piecemeal\" ruling on same-sex marriages.

The court and all of those who argued today did a very good job of putting those issues before the court and I look forward to being on the right side of history.\"\n\nAmerican public opinion on same-sex marriage has shifted dramatically in recent years. In 1996, a Gallup poll found that more than two in three Americans did not believe that same-sex marriage should be \"recognized by the law as valid.\" In a May 2014 poll by Gallup, a majority of Americans — 55 percent — supported legalizing same-sex marriage nationally. Among respondents 18 to 29 years old, it was a landslide, with 78 percent in favor.\n\nThe picture in Louisiana, however, is different. In 2004, voters amended the state constitution to outlaw same-sex marriage as well as civil unions, and this year's Gallup poll found that Southern states are the only region of the country where same-sex marriage support is not in the majority (48 percent).\n\nJust last month, Mayor Mitch Landrieu — who has long supported civil unions for same-sex couples — quietly added his name to the \"Mayors for the Freedom to Marry\" website, a list of hundreds of U.S. mayors in favor of same-sex marriage. In a statement, Landrieu spokesman Tyler Gamble wrote, \"The Mayor has long supported ending marriage discrimination at all levels of government. As an employer, the City of New Orleans recognizes domestic partnerships and allows our employees' partners to be eligible for benefits. The City has an interest in strengthening and supporting all caring, committed and responsible family forms, which is why the City signed an amicus brief in support of the Robicheaux case now pending in federal court.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs in that case include Jon Robicheaux and Derek Penton (married in Iowa in 2012), Courtney and Nadine Blanchard (married in Iowa in 2013), Nick Van Sickels and Andrew Bond (married in Washington D.C. in 2012), Henry Lambert and Carey Bond (married in New York in 2011), and Harvard Scott and Sergio March Prieto (married in Vermont in 2010).\n\nWhile President Barack Obama spoke in favor of same-sex marriage in 2012, and many in the Democratic party joined him, U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu is one of only three Democratic senators who have not spoken out on the issue — though her position has softened. Landrieu, who has publicly supported civil unions, issued a statement in March saying, \"The people of Louisiana have made clear that marriage in our state is restricted to one man and one woman. While my personal views have evolved, I will support the outcome of Louisiana's recent vote.\" Her Republican counterpart, U.S. Sen. David Vitter, is against same-sex marriage; Vitter has proposed to amend the U.S. Constitution to ban the practice. \"I don't believe there's any issue as important as this one,\" Vitter said in 2006.\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal, meanwhile, has always been against same-sex marriage. He recently doubled down on the position in stump speeches across the country. \"The reality is today we're talking about redefining marriage,\" he told a crowd in Iowa in 2012 (where a ruling by the state Supreme Court there legalized same-sex marriage in 2009). \"If the court is allowed to impose and write their own laws and their own views ... tomorrow it may be property rights, maybe it's Second Amendment rights. We have got to take a stand against judicial activism.\"\n\nPlaintiffs in the current suit and their attorneys have pointed to the 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision in U.S. v. Windsor, which held that the federal definition of marriage between heterosexual couples is unconstitutional. Attorneys for the state argue that the Windsor decision leaves those definitions to the rights of the state.\n\nChris Otten, chair-elect for Forum For Equality, said he expects Feldman will issue a \"thorough and well-reasoned opinion,\" though he stopped short of guessing how Feldman might rule. \"It's premature to opine on that,\" Otten said. \"It was evident today he was well-prepared and attorneys on both sides were well-prepared.

Meanwhile, a three-judge panel of the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that struck down a ban in Utah, saying Utah's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage (similar to Louisiana's) violated the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right to marry, establish a family, raise children, and enjoy the full protection of a state's marital laws,\" Judge Carlos F. Lucero wrote in the decision. \"A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union. ... We agree with the multiple district courts that have held that the fundamental right to marry necessarily includes the right to remain married.\"\n\nGriggs said she hopes the decisions \"have an impact\" on Feldman's ruling. In legal parlance, a decision from another federal circuit is a \"persuasive\" but not necessarily \"binding\" precedent. Louisiana is in the federal system's 5th Circuit, which is widely considered the nation's most conservative appellate court.\n\nTony Perkins, a former Louisiana state representative and staunch same-sex marriage opponent, now heads the Washington D.C.-based lobbying group Family Research Council. Perkins issued his own statement on the recent federal court decisions affecting Indiana and Utah: \"Today's marriage rulings come as no surprise given the rising disdain for the rule of law promoted by the Obama Administration. While judges can, by judicial fiat, declare same-sex 'marriage' legal, they will never be able to make it right. The courts, for all their power, can't overturn natural law.\" Perkins added that Americans are \"tired of seeing the foundations of a free and just society destroyed by a handful of black-robed tyrants.\"\n\nFor plaintiff Jacqueline Brettner, however, the hearing in Feldman's court — decision or not — was intensely personal. \"I didn't expect to get emotional,\" she said. \"Walking here today, it hit me how important it is, not just as a parent ... but as a human being.\n\n\"It's something we live with every day, it's something that permeates dropping off at school, leaving the country for a trip — these are decisions and questions posed to us on a regular basis, that other people thankfully get to take for granted.

court for the ultimate decision on whether marriage is a fundamental right that can not be denied to samesex couples the justices sidestepped that question last june but the reasoning used by the majority of supreme court justices in rejecting the federal definition of marriage as between one man and one woman has been cited by lower courts in an unbroken string of victories for supporters of gay rights judges have struck down state bans from virginia to oregon this has been accompanied by polls that show an increasing public acceptance of samesex marriage and its proponents say by a growing sense of inevitability the 10th circuit panel which is based in denver became the first appeals court to apply the supreme court decision and said it compelled the outcome we hold that the

makes him the only federal judge since the supreme courts decision in us v windsor last year to say he would leave a state ban in place kelly said that marriage between people of the same gender is not a fundamental right and that the decision whether to open the institution to gay couples belongs to the electorate and their representatives he said judges should resist the temptation to become philosopherkings imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the 14th amendment lucero said it might be preferable to let the national debate play out through legislative and democratic channels but he added that the protection and exercise of fundamental rights are not matters for opinion polls or the ballot box there is irony in the fact that utah one of the most conservative states is at the forefront of returning the issue to the supreme court after a federal judge in salt lake city overturned the states ban late last year more than 1000 couples were wed before the high court stayed his decision that stay will remain in place while the state considers its next step the appellate panel said utah attorney general sean d reyes r said in a statement that he had not decided whether to ask the full 10th circuit appeals court to review the panels decision but that the ultimate question must be decided by the supreme court although utah lost he said we

colorado kansas new mexico oklahoma utah and wyoming of the six only new mexico currently allows samesex marriage because the panel stayed its order the bans in the other states are not affected the same panel of judges has heard an appeal of a lower courts ruling that oklahomas ban is unconstitutional but it has not ruled in that case the issue of samesex marriage is working its way through appeals courts nationwide the us court of appeals for the 4th circuit based in richmond va for instance is reviewing a decision that struck down virginias ban in august the us court of appeals for the 6th circuit based in cincinnati will hear arguments in cases involving all four states in its jurisdiction where bans have been struck down or states have been ordered to recognize samesex marriages performed elsewhere the supreme court is most likely to take up the issue if various appellate courts disagree about whether the bans are unconstitutional but most observers say the supreme court will need to decide the issue at some point even if the lower courts are all in agreement in wednesdays decision lucero rejected all of utahs arguments that it had legitimate reasons to limit marriage to a man and a woman he said that limiting marriage to couples that could naturally procreate was not valid because elderly and infertile heterosexual couples are allowed to marry as well as those who do not intend to have children he said the panel joined other courts who found it wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of the love and commitment between samesex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of oppositesex couples and he rejected slipperyslope arguments that recognizing samesex marriage would necessarily require the recognition of other relationships unlike polygamous or incestuous marriages the supreme court has explicitly extended constitutional protection to intimate samesex relationships lucero said kate kendell executive director of the national

(Rick Wilking/Reuters)\n\nA federal appeals court on Wednesday for the first time employed a landmark Supreme Court decision to declare that the fundamental right to marriage must be extended to gay couples, adding momentum to a remarkably rapid recognition of same-sex marriage by judges nationwide.\n\nThe 2-to-1 decision by a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld a lower court’s decision that Utah’s constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage could not stand.\n\nThe ruling came almost exactly one year after the Supreme Court delivered a pair of major gay rights victories and could be instrumental in returning the issue to the high court for the ultimate decision on whether marriage is a fundamental right that cannot be denied to same-sex couples.\n\nThe justices sidestepped that question last June.\n\nBut the reasoning used by the majority of Supreme Court justices in rejecting the federal definition of marriage as between one man and one woman has been cited by lower courts in an unbroken string of victories for supporters of gay rights. Judges have struck down state bans from Virginia to Oregon.\n\nThis has been accompanied by polls that show an increasing public acceptance of same-sex marriage and, its proponents say, by a growing sense of inevitability.\n\nThe 10th Circuit panel, which is based in Denver, became the first appeals court to apply the Supreme Court decision and said it compelled the outcome.\n\n“We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right to marry, establish a family, raise children, and enjoy the full protection of a state’s marital laws,” Circuit Judge Carlos F. Lucero wrote. “A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union.”\n\nLucero, whom President Bill Clinton nominated to the bench, was joined in the decision by Circuit Judge Jerome A. Holmes, a George W. Bush nominee.\n\nCircuit Judge Paul J. Kelly Jr., who was nominated by President George H.W. Bush, dissented. That makes him the only federal judge since the Supreme Court’s decision in U.S. v. Windsor last year to say he would leave a state ban in place.\n\nKelly said that marriage between people of the same gender is not a fundamental right and that the decision whether to open the institution to gay couples “belongs to the electorate and their representatives.”\n\nHe said judges “should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the 14th Amendment.”\n\nLucero said it might be “preferable” to let the national debate play out “through legislative and democratic channels.” But he added that “the protection and exercise of fundamental rights are not matters for opinion polls or the ballot box.”\n\nThere is irony in the fact that Utah, one of the most conservative states, is at the forefront of returning the issue to the Supreme Court. After a federal judge in Salt Lake City overturned the state’s ban late last year, more than 1,000 couples were wed before the high court stayed his decision. That stay will remain in place while the state considers its next step, the appellate panel said.\n\nUtah Attorney General Sean D. Reyes (R) said in a statement that he had not decided whether to ask the full 10th Circuit appeals court to review the panel’s decision but that the ultimate question must be decided by the Supreme Court.\n\nAlthough Utah lost, he said, “we are pleased that the ruling has been issued and takes us one step closer to reaching certainty and finality for all Utahns on such an important issue.”\n\nRulings from the 10th Circuit are binding in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. Of the six, only New Mexico currently allows same-sex marriage.\n\nBecause the panel stayed its order, the bans in the other states are not affected. The same panel of judges has heard an appeal of a lower court’s ruling that Oklahoma’s ban is unconstitutional but it has not ruled in that case.\n\nThe issue of same-sex marriage is working its way through appeals courts nationwide. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, based in Richmond, Va., for instance, is reviewing a decision that struck down Virginia’s ban. In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, based in Cincinnati, will hear arguments in cases involving all four states in its jurisdiction, where bans have been struck down or states have been ordered to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere.\n\nThe Supreme Court is most likely to take up the issue if various appellate courts disagree about whether the bans are unconstitutional. But most observers say the Supreme Court will need to decide the issue at some point, even if the lower courts are all in agreement.\n\nIn Wednesday’s decision, Lucero rejected all of Utah’s arguments that it had legitimate reasons to limit marriage to a man and a woman. He said that limiting marriage to couples that could naturally procreate was not valid, because elderly and infertile heterosexual couples are allowed to marry, as well as those who do not intend to have children.\n\nHe said the panel joined other courts who found it “wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of the love and commitment between same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples.”\n\nAnd he rejected “slippery-slope” arguments that recognizing same-sex marriage would necessarily require the recognition of other relationships. “Unlike polygamous or incestuous marriages, the Supreme Court has explicitly extended constitutional protection to intimate same-sex relationships,” Lucero said.\n\nKate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said the appeals court opinion “marks an indelible milestone in our nation’s journey to full inclusion — and one that will undoubtedly influence other courts in the months to come.”\n\n“While judges can, by judicial fiat, declare same-sex ‘marriage’ legal, they will never be able to make it right,” said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. “The courts, for all their power, can’t overturn natural law.”\n\nIn a statement on its Web site, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Utah, said it continues to believe that “marriage should be between a man and a woman but that “all people should be treated with respect.” Anticipating that the final decision will be the Supreme Court’s, the church said, “It is our hope that the nation’s highest court will uphold traditional marriage.”\n\nAt the same time that the court in Denver was acting, a federal district judge on Wednesday struck down Indiana’s ban on same-sex marriage and allowed gay couples in that state to wed immediately.",

            "text": "Editor’s note: Utah is now at the heart of the debate over same-sex marriage. The state’s Amendment 3, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, was challenged in court as unconstitutional and was subsequently struck down by a federal judge in 2013. Utah appealed that verdict. On Wednesday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled against Utah, 2-1. If this case is appealed to the Supreme Court, which appears likely, the court’s decision may decide the future of marriage for decades – for the entire country.\n\nDoes the right of self-determination extend to voters’ decisions to protect children’s entitlement to be reared by a married mother and father? We learned this week that two judges on the 10th Circuit Court think the answer is no. One of their colleagues, however, wrote a strong dissenting opinion highlighting just how radical that answer is.\n\nThe majority opinion is something of a departure from previous cases. The judges admit that Utah voters cannot be accused of hatred or animus just because they wanted to retain the child-centered understanding of marriage.\n\nThe crux of their opinion is the novel claim that the Constitution has, since 1868, contained an unwritten “fundamental right” to same-sex marriage. They try to disguise the radicalness of that claim by saying that they are only applying the right to marry that has been previously recognized by the Supreme Court. That’s an implausible claim given that no state had redefined marriage to include same-sex couples until 2004, long after the court’s latest right-to-marry case.\n\nTo reach the result the 10th Circuit judges did in this case requires first redefining marriage to mean something it has never meant before — the right to choose one’s life partner of either sex. Only after marriage is understood in that way (in contrast to the virtually universal understanding of marriage as the union of husband and wife that prevailed just over a decade ago) can it make any sense to say that there is a right to marriage that includes same-sex relationships.\n\nA major problem with that approach is that the U.S. Supreme Court has said that if a new right is to be recognized by the federal courts, it must be identified as precisely as possible and must be implicit in the history and tradition of the nation. The “right” the 10th Circuit majority has announced, precisely identified, is a right to same-sex marriage. Why? Because when the Supreme Court recognized a right to marry, the only kind of legal marriage in the United States was the union of husband and wife. To recognize the new right to same-sex marriage, the judge needed to show that this “right” is part of the nation’s history and traditions. That is an insurmountable obstacle for an innovation introduced a mere decade ago by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.\n\nThe court also rejects the state’s reasonable concerns about what will happen if the state is forced to abandon the ideal that children should be raised by their own married mother and father whenever possible, or another married mother and father when that’s not possible. It does so only by relying on its own unsupported assumptions that an official government message that men and women, mothers and fathers, are interchangeable and that neither is essential to child well-being will have no effect. Our experience with nearly 40 years of government endorsement of the idea that marriage is binding only until one party is dissatisfied should cause us to be very suspicious of that claim.\n\nThe dissenting opinion in the case is very important.

Not only is that beyond our power, it is completely arbitrary and impractical; as in this case, a state should be allowed to adopt change if desired and implement it.” He concludes: “We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.”\n\nWhat does this decision mean for the future? A media talking point has been that same-sex marriage is on a roll, having received the support of a couple dozen federal judges in the last year. Thus, the argument goes, a national mandate for redefinition is inevitable. The problem with that line of reasoning is that all of the court decisions to this point rest on an interpretation of implications of last year’s Supreme Court’s decision on the Defense of Marriage Act (the decision itself said nothing about whether states had to redefine marriage). If the judges took the wrong cues from the Supreme Court’s silence, every one of the decisions mandating marriage will be meaningless.\n\nThere is a definite bright side in the timing of the 10th Circuit opinion. This is the first federal appeals court decision striking down a state marriage law.

            "text": "A federal appeals court ruled Friday that Oklahoma must allow gay couples to wed, marking the second time it has found the US constitution protects same-sex marriage.\n\nThe decision from the 10th US circuit court of appeals upholds a ruling that struck down Oklahoma's gay marriage ban. But the Denver-based court immediately put its decision on hold pending an appeal, meaning same-sex couple won't be allowed to marry in Oklahoma for now.\n\nThe 2-1 ruling comes after the same three-judge panel ruled in June that Utah's ban on same-sex marriage violates the constitution. It was the first time an appellate court determined that last year's US supreme court decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act meant states couldn't deny gays the ability to wed. That ruling also is on hold, and Utah's attorney general has said he plans to appeal to the US supreme court.\n\nThe lawsuit challenging Oklahoma's ban was filed against the Tulsa County clerk, whose attorneys were still considering their options Friday afternoon. But they noted the panel's dissenting judge argued that changing the definition of marriage should belong to Oklahoma residents, not a federal court.\n\n\"Every child deserves a mom and a dad, and the people of Oklahoma confirmed that at the ballot box when they approved a constitutional amendment that affirmed marriage as a man-woman union,\" said Byron Babione, senior attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom, which is defending the county clerk.\n\nProponents of gay marriage quickly planned rallies Friday in Oklahoma City and Tulsa to celebrate the ruling.\n\n\"We're excited that Oklahoma will be counted among the places where all of its citizens are treated equally,\" said Toby Jenkins, executive director of Oklahomans for Equality.\n\nIn its 46-page ruling Friday, the judges dealt less with the constitutionality of same-sex marriages and instead focused more on arcane legal matters of whether the Oklahoma couples sued the correct government officials.\n\nHowever, Justice Carlos Lucero reiterated that the court has already found that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marry that cannot be breached by the state's concern with keeping the focus of marriage on the procreative potential of man-woman unions. He wrote that Oklahoma's ban, \"denies a fundamental right to all same-sex couples who seek to marry or to have their marriages recognized regardless of their child-rearing ambitions.\"\n\nJustice Jerome A Holmes concurred but stressed in his own opinion that the court did not find that voters exhibited legal animus, or dislike, toward gay individuals when they outlawed same-sex marriage in 2004. Justice Paul Kelly Jr dissented.\n\nThe two decisions give increased momentum to a legal cause that has compiled an impressive string of lower court victories. More than 20 courts have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates since the supreme court's Doma ruling in June 2013. The rulings have come in 17 states, with Florida being the latest.\n\nTwo of the most striking of those decisions were in conservative Utah and Oklahoma, which saw their voter-approved gay marriage bans struck down in December and January, respectively. In Utah, more than 1,000 same-sex couples married before the supreme court issued a stay.\n\nIt's unclear whether the two cases will be the first to reach the supreme court. The high court could choose from cases moving through five other federal appellate courts, and it won't consider a case until next year at the earliest.\n\nAttorneys representing Utah and Oklahoma argued voters have the right to define marriage in their states, and unions between a man and woman are best for children.\n\nGay rights lawyers countered that voters cannot define marriage in a way that deprives gay people of their fundamental rights, and say there is no proof that gay couples make inferior parents.\n\nTen years ago, nearly a dozen states outlawed gay marriage. Now same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia, and recent polls show a majority of Americans support it.",

as such also on wednesday a threejudge panel on the 10th us circuit court of appeals in denver ruled in a 21 decision that utah can no longer deny a marriage license to a couple based solely on their genders the same court is also considering the ban in oklahoma but did not rule on that case wednesday with the two rulings wednesday samesex marriage is legal in 20 states plus the district of

admitted he was homosexual which opponents argued was a conflict of interest judicial fiat daniel schmid litigation counsel for the profamily nonprofit legal advocacy group liberty counsel said activist judges are erasing hundreds of years of legal precedent and imposing samesex marriage on the states by judicial fiat i have to be honest with you when i look at each one of these cases i see an activist judge kowtowing to the homosexual lobby ignoring precedent and overstepping the bounds of what theyre supposed to do schmid told wnd he cited the example of baker v nelson a 1971 case in which the minnesota supreme court ruled the states limitation of marriage to a man and a woman did not violate the us constitution the case was appealed to the us supreme court which dismissed it for want of a substantial federal question baker versus nelson had been binding precedent for a long time and now you have federal judges ignoring that and saying weve had significant doctrinal developments when only the us supreme court can issue doctrinal developments schmid said he said the activist judges love to cite loving v virginia a 1967 case involving the marriage of a black woman and a white man in which the supreme court struck down state laws preventing interracial marriage they use that case to say there is a fundamental right to marriage yes but its a fundamental right to marry a member of the opposite sex schmid said and for good reason the state has always had a compelling interest in fostering procreation the 10th circuit court today ignored that they walked right past that schmid said several studies have indicated that children who grow up in families with a mother and a father also tend to do better academically physically and emotionally he said advocates of samesex marriage will argue that divorces shouldnt be allowed either then because children do better with two parents in the home but just because there are situations out there that arent ideal doesnt mean the state cant encourage what is optimum schmid said these judges are literally making it up as they go along what has changed is we now have activist judges and homosexual friendly politicians who are just ignoring what the constitution says siding with an ideology and politics over sound precedent and the rule of law rising disdain for the rule of law the family research council also issued a statement wednesday denouncing the two rulings on samesex marriage frc president tony perkins said the rulings came as no surprise given the rising disdain for the rule of law promoted by the obama administration these latest rulings are not just about redefining marriage but they are a further attempt by the courts to untether our public policies from the democratic process as well as the anthropological record he said just last week the us senate confirmed two openly gay judges – darrin gayles to the us district court for southern district of florida and staci yandle to the us district court for the southern district of illinois gayles becomes the nations first openly homosexual black man to be confirmed to the federal bench while yandle will become the nations second black lesbian federal judge perkins said that while judges can by judicial fiat declare samesex marriage legal they will never be able to make it right he said the rampant judicial activism that has taken hold of the federal courts could backfire if pushed too far the courts for all their power cant overturn natural law what they can do is incite a movement of indignant americans who are tired of seeing the foundations of a free and just society destroyed by a handful of blackrobed tyrants perkins said the left has long believed packing the federal courts with liberal jurists is the means of fulfilling a radical social agenda as the american people refuse to endorse that agenda at the polls or through their elected representatives as we saw with roe v wade in 1973 – despite the lefts earnest hopes the courts do not have the final say the american people will have the final word as they experience the consequences of marriage redefinition and the ways in

            "text": "The list of states that define marriage as between a man and a woman keeps getting shorter, thanks to activist judges that have disregarded years of legal precedent and struck down laws that don’t fit their personal agenda, contend conservative legal scholars and advocates of traditional family values.\n\nThe latest blow to traditional matrimony came Wednesday when federal courts struck down laws in Utah and Indiana that ban same-sex marriage.\n\nIndiana’s ban was lifted immediately, and a county clerk in Indianapolis said she would start issuing licenses to same-sex couples, even though the state’s attorney general said he planned to appeal the decision.\n\nU.S. District Judge Richard Young ruled that Indiana’s Defense of Marriage Act violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal-protection clause, because it treats same-sex couples differently.\n\n“Same-sex couples, who would otherwise qualify to marry in Indiana, have the right to marry in Indiana,” he wrote. “These couples, when gender and sexual orientation are taken away, are in all respects like the family down the street. The Constitution demands that we treat them as such.”\n\nAlso on Wednesday, a three-judge panel on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver ruled in a 2-1 decision that Utah can no longer deny a marriage license to a couple based solely on their genders. The same court is also considering the ban in Oklahoma but did not rule on that case Wednesday.\n\nWith the two rulings Wednesday, same-sex marriage is legal in 20 states plus the District of Columbia. Thirteen states have had their marriage laws overturned by a federal court, and in many cases, such as in Indiana, a single judge made the decision.\n\nWednesday’s rulings came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court’s 5-4 ruling that struck down California’s voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. The judge in the forerunner to that case, Vaughn Walker, later admitted he was homosexual, which opponents argued was a conflict of interest.\n\nDaniel Schmid, litigation counsel for the pro-family non-profit legal advocacy group Liberty Counsel, said activist judges are erasing hundreds of years of legal precedent and imposing same-sex marriage on the states by judicial fiat.\n\n“I have to be honest with you. When I look at each one of these cases I see an activist judge kowtowing to the homosexual lobby, ignoring precedent and overstepping the bounds of what they’re supposed to do,” Schmid told WND.\n\nHe cited the example of Baker v. Nelson, a 1971 case in which the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled the state’s limitation of marriage to a man and a woman did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which dismissed it “for want of a substantial federal question.”\n\n“Baker versus Nelson had been binding precedent for a long time, and now you have federal judges ignoring that and saying ‘we’ve had significant doctrinal developments,’ when only the U.S. Supreme Court can issue doctrinal developments,” Schmid said.\n\nHe said the activist judges love to cite Loving v. Virginia, a 1967 case involving the marriage of a black woman and a white man in which the Supreme Court struck down state laws preventing interracial marriage.\n\n“They use that case to say there is a fundamental right to marriage. Yes, but it’s a fundamental right to marry a member of the opposite sex,” Schmid said. “And for good reason. The state has always had a compelling interest in fostering procreation. The 10th Circuit Court today ignored that. They walked right past that.”\n\nSchmid said several studies have indicated that children who grow up in families with a mother and a father also tend to do better academically, physically and emotionally.\n\nHe said advocates of same-sex marriage will argue that divorces shouldn’t be allowed either, then, because children do better with two parents in the home.\n\n“But just because there are situations out there that aren’t ideal doesn’t mean the state can’t encourage what is optimum,” Schmid said. “These judges are literally making it up as they go along. What has changed is we now have activist judges and homosexual friendly politicians who are just ignoring what the Constitution says, siding with an ideology and politics over sound precedent and the rule of law.”\n\n‘Rising disdain for the rule of law’\n\nThe Family Research Council also issued a statement Wednesday denouncing the two rulings on same-sex marriage.\n\nFRC President Tony Perkins said the rulings came as no surprise, given “the rising disdain for the rule of law promoted by the Obama administration.”\n\n“These latest rulings are not just about redefining marriage, but they are a further attempt by the courts to untether our public policies from the democratic process, as well as the anthropological record,” he said.\n\nJust last week, the U.S. Senate confirmed two openly “gay” judges – Darrin Gayles to the U.S. District Court for Southern District of Florida and Staci Yandle to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois.\n\nGayles becomes the nation’s first openly homosexual black man to be confirmed to the federal bench while Yandle will become the nation’s second black lesbian federal judge.\n\nPerkins said that while judges can, “by judicial fiat, declare same-sex ‘marriage’ legal, they will never be able to make it right.”\n\nHe said the rampant judicial activism that has taken hold of the federal courts could backfire if pushed too far.\n\n“The courts, for all their power, can’t overturn natural law. What they can do is incite a movement of indignant Americans, who are tired of seeing the foundations of a free and just society destroyed by a handful of black-robed tyrants,” Perkins said. “The left has long believed packing the federal courts with liberal jurists is the means of fulfilling a radical social agenda, as the American people refuse to endorse that agenda at the polls or through their elected representatives.\n\n“As we saw with Roe v. Wade in 1973 – despite the left’s earnest hopes, the courts do not have the final say. The American people will have the final word as they experience the consequences of marriage redefinition and the ways in which it fundamentally alters America’s moral, cultural and political landscape.”\n\nSame-sex marriage in Utah likely will remain on hold pending the appeal.\n\nIn his dissent Wednesday, 10th Circuit Justice Paul J. Kelly Jr. said the court was overstepping its authority and that states should be able to decide who can marry.\n\n“We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of the Fourteenth Amendment,” he wrote.",

In a 2-1 decision, the panel ruled that the Constitution guarantees that \"those who wish to marry a person of the same sex are entitled to exercise the same fundamental right as it is recognized by persons who wish to marry a person of the opposite sex.\" The ruling was immediately stayed, recognizing that the Supreme Court had stayed the district court's original ruling earlier this year.\n\nA federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled for the first time that states must allow gay couples to marry, finding the Constitution protects same-sex relationships and putting a remarkable legal winning streak across the country one step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court. The three-judge panel in Denver found it \"wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of the love and commitment between same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples.\"... \"All I can say is that we are thrilled,\" said Kody Partridge, one of the Utah plaintiffs. She was working in the garden with her wife, Laurie Wood, when they heard about the ruling. \"This is such as historic thing, not just for Utah but for Laurie and me\" and plaintiffs across the country, Partridge said. \"This is a big day.\"\n\nMore from the ruling:\n\n\"Having persuaded us that the right to marry is a fundamental liberty, plaintiffs will prevail on their due process and equal protection claims unless appellants can show that Amendment 3 survives strict scrutiny. ... Instead of explaining why same-sex marriage qua same-sex marriage is undesirable, each of the appellants' justifications rests fundamentally on a sleight of hand in which same-sex marriage is used as a proxy for a different characteristic shared by both same-sex and some opposite-sex couples. Same-sex marriage must be banned, appellants argue, because same-sex couples are not naturally procreative. But the state permits many other types of non-procreative couples to wed. ... We emphatically agree with the numerous cases decided since Windsor that it is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of the love and commitment between same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples. ...\"\n\nIncredible news!

june brings a flurry of decisions by the united states supreme court it ends its term as the summer begins and as the term ends a series of decisions are handed down that are likely to be remembered as the most important of the courts term why its because the court takes this time the distance between the oral arguments in a case until the decision is handed down to make certain that it has said what it wants to say when the decision is released and the last of those decisions will be handed down next monday the last day of june and the last day of the courts term but yesterday there were important decisions handed down before the court went into a threeday recess and among those two decisions the most important is the fact that the court unanimously struck down a socalled buffer zone when it has to do with abortion counseling in the city of boston and by extension to the entire commonwealth of massachusetts the courts ruling was 9 to 0 in terms of the fact that the buffer zone which prevented any kind of counseling of a woman against having an abortion as being a violation of the basic american right a fundamental right of free speech but even as the decision was handed down on a 90 vote what was behind the decision was a disagreement on the court as to how far the decision should reach for example the majority opinion struck down the fact that there could be a buffer zone that would privilege certain kinds of speech over against other speech when it comes to that 35foot space that would include public sidewalks and public streets in front of any abortion clinic the court did not strike down a similar law that would have allowed for this kind of buffer zone in front of any kind of medical facility and the court majority insisted that this decision actually has nothing at all whatsoever to do with abortion so what we have here is the court unanimously saying that what the massachusetts law stipulated was unconstitutional an unconstitutional abridgment of that basic american constitutional right of free speech but you also had a basic division on the court that made something else evident the only way the court got to a 90 vote on this issue was by agreeing that this was not an abortion case had it been an abortion case the liberals on the court wouldve found themselves in a dutybound position by their own logic to defend abortion over against any kind of infringement one of the most concerning aspects of the contemporary composition of the us supreme court is that those on the left are adamantly determined to defend abortion under virtually any conceivable circumstance including even socalled partialbirth abortions as the hometown newspaper there in massachusetts the boston globe declared the us supreme court had ruled that the state laws violated the first amendment restricting access to public ways and sidewalks—and the keywords are what follows—places that are traditionally open for free debate but the disagreement on the court itself even behind the 90 ruling was made evident in the concurring opinion that was handed down by justice antonin scalia who was joined by justice anthony kennedy and justice clarence thomas in his initial words in his concurring opinion he said todays opinion carries forward this courts practice of giving abortionrights advocates a pass when it comes to suppressing the freespeech rights of their opponents there is an entirely separate abridged version of the first amendment applicable to speech against abortion now i happen to believe that justice scalia is absolutely right in making this assertion hes right in suggesting that theres something cowardly about a court that reaches the right decision by agreeing that the issue isnt what the issue is actually about—in other words abortion justice scalia is counted in the unanimous vote—after all it was 90—but he writes about the majority opinion this is an opinion that has something for everyone and the more significant portion continues the onward march of abortion speech only jurisprudence time will tell whether or not in this case as in so many others justice scalias proved to be prophetic but at the very least anyone who is concerned for the sanctity of human life has to see this as a win it may turn out to be a narrow win but its a very significant win and since it was a unanimous decision in that sense it is a very conclusive win the opportunity is now before the commonwealth of massachusetts to try to come back and rewrite the law so that it does not conflict with the united states constitution but the majority opinion even with the criticisms of justice scalia will be a mighty powerful obstacle for the state of massachusetts to overcome in trying to craft just such a law 2 separation of powers defended in court in america not in battlefield in a second major decision handed down by the court yesterday the court rebuked the president of the united states the court ruled that president obama had overreached his constitutional authority by making certain socalled recess appointments when the senate of the united states was not actually in recess the court ruled unanimously that president obama had innovated even over the practices of his predecessors by making appointments when the senate actually wasnt in recess when it was just in something like a threeday holiday weekend in other words the president was acting over against the constitution was overreaching his constitutional authority in making certain appointments years ago to the national labor relations board and this is a farreaching decision in this sense because this means that every one of the decisions made by that very important federal agency in the time since president obama made those recess appointments is now in question because as it turns out those who were serving on the board were not qualified to do so they had not been confirmed by the senate by a narrower vote in the second part of this decision a 54 vote a bare majority of the court decided not to virtually eliminate the presidents recess appointment power altogether thats also very telling it tells us that there was only a onevote margin separating those who were willing to say that in this age the president has no right of such recess appointments so it was a 90 decision on the big question and a 54 decision on the more narrow question so what from the christian worldview perspective is most important here whats important is the american genius of the constitutional separation of powers we should stand back in a bit of wonder here and recognize that this is possible this kind of decision the framing of this kind of issue only in the united states of america and only under the american constitution the united states constitution that is to this day the longestoperating written constitution in the history of humanity and we need also to recognize that there was a deep christian wisdom written into that separation of powers that deep christian wisdom is the understanding that evil tends to collect itself where power is unchecked and it is the doctrine of sin that led the founders of this country to believe that every branch of government needed to be coequal able to check any overreach by another power and in this case its a very interesting threepart discussion because you had the supreme court of the united states an equal branch of government with congress and the president instructing the president of the united states that he had acted unconstitutionally in not allowing the congress of the united states the opportunity to review and to consent to his appointments also making news in terms of the separation of powers this week the speaker the house of representatives john boehner announced that he will sue president obama by the use of executive actions that go around the authority of congress and this will again demonstrate the separation of powers with the speaker of the house suing the president of the united states before a federal court from a christian worldview perspective theres something else that needs to be noted here many other nations would go to war over this there would be an attempted coup or some kind of toppling of the power structure in the united states of america one of the wonders of our constitutional system and its longevity is the fact that even when the disagreements run this deep people go court not to war 3 edie windsor celebrated by bill clinton the president who signed doma yesterday marked the oneyear anniversary of the windsor decision handed down by the united states supreme court that was the decision that struck down the defense of marriage act i was asked by cnn to respond on that oneyear anniversary my article appeared today at cnncom but yesterday on that oneyear anniversary there was a bizarre cover story frontpage story at usa today and yet very few people seemed to have noted just how bizarre it is the article is by richard wolf the lead reporter on this issue for usa today heres how he began the article edie windsor turned 85 last week but she was too overdone for a party the woman whose lawsuit forced the federal government to recognize samesex marriage introduced president obama at a democratic national committee event a few nights earlier a few nights later she was to be introduced by former president bill clinton at an mtv trailblazers event now as you heard her name edie windsor is the reason why the windsor decision has its name it was she who sued against the federal governments defense of marriage act and she won in court and it was thus struck down that will stand as one of the most signal decisions of the united states supreme court and to those who believe that marriage by gods intention should be the union of a man and a woman one of the most devastating judicial actions ever undertaken but what makes this story so interesting were those last words in that introductory paragraph let me read them again a few nights earlier she was to be honored by former president bill clinton at an mtv trailblazers event wheres the irony there well edie windsor sued the government of the united states over the defense of marriage act claiming the defense of marriage act was a basic denial of her basic human rights and winning her argument at the nations highest court striking down a law that had been overwhelmingly passed by congress and signed into law by the then president of the united states thats the irony the president of the united states in 1996 the president who signed that bill into the law was bill clinton who was supposedly according to usa today introducing her to be celebrated at a trailblazers event on mtv he was supposed to be celebrating her for having overturned the law that he signed into law in 1996 it takes someone like bill clinton to be able to pull that off to be on both sides of the same issue on mtv 4 10th circuit majority opinion views opposition to samesex marriage as wholly illogical on yesterdays edition of the briefing we talked about another judicial decision that was the decision at the 10 th us circuit court of appeals in denver that struck down utahs constitutional amendment against samesex marriage we covered the issue then but something of additional interest has come to light we mentioned yesterday that thats the first us court of appeals to come to this kind of decision and that sets up the likelihood that the issue will arrive at the us supreme court as early as this coming fall but what brings me back to the issue today is the subsequent coverage in particular an article that appeared from the associated press an article the reveals far more than may have been intended the associated press reports a federal appeals court ruled wednesday that states must allow gay couples to marry finding the constitution protects samesex relationships and putting a remarkable legal winning streak across the country one step closer to the us supreme court the paper continued the threejudge panel in denver ruled two to one that states can not deprive people of the fundamental right to marry simply because they want to be wedded to someone of the samesex but then note with great care the words that follow the judges added they dont want to brand as intolerant those who oppose gay marriage but they said theres no reasonable objection to the practice so the summary here offered by the associated press comes down to the fact that the two winning judges on the threejudge panel deciding this issue decided that they didnt want to call people who oppose samesex marriage intolerant but in the very next statement they say theres no reasonable objection to the practice in their opinion the judges actually said it is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of samesex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite sex couples now thats an interesting statement in itself it actually doesnt even reach to the actual reason why those who oppose samesex marriage are opposed to it but whats far more interesting is the reading of motivations behind it that here you have the associated press apparently objectively trying to tell us whats happening in this story explaining that the two judges on the winning side of this threejudge panel said that they didnt want to brand those who oppose samesex marriage as intolerant so they came up with something else to say were simply illogical irrational on the wrong side of history on the wrong side of reason on the wrong side of their twojudge majority 5 state department event honors woman who opposes existence of marriage next as we go into the weekend i must report on an event that recently took place at the united states state department presided over by the secretary of state of the united states john kerry were indebted to the reportorial website breitbart for bringing to our attention the fact that this event was held it was an event celebrating lgbt issues at the united states state department and the elevation of those issues in american foreign policy under the administration of barack obama and under the leadership of secretary john kerry but as breitbart reports one of the speakers was journalist and lgbt activist masha gessen who has been an outspoken critic of the russian government on lgbt issues shes written a book about vladimir putin for a time she headed the moscow office of us radio liberty and shes been a prolific commentator to the new york times blogs secretary of state john kerry introduced her by saying the government in moscow may look at masha as a troublemaker to contend with but here in the united states we know that she is a wonderful person a mother a journalist an extraordinary human rights defender and were honored by her presence here she was indeed lauded by the united states state department at this public event as one who symbolizes the kinds of gains that the gayrights movement has made not only in the united states but internationally in recent years she has moved with her partner and their children to the united states but what the state department did not draw attention to is something else for which masha gessen is known she has not only called for the legalization of samesex marriage she has called for the end of marriage altogether she has said i agree that we should have the right to marry but i also think equally that it is a nobrainer that the institution of marriage should not exist fighting for gay marriage generally involves lying about what were going to do with marriage when we get there because we lie that the institution of marriage is not going to change and that is a lie the institution of marriage is going to change and it should change and again i dont think it should exist so the united states state department at an event presided over by the united states secretary of state honored someone who has called for the legalization of samesex marriage as a way of getting to the elimination of marriage altogether and who makes the argument that its only honest for samesex marriage advocates to make very clear that their position is calling for samesex marriage only until they can destroy marriage altogether the state department also did not draw attention to what masha gessen has described in her own words as a complicated family structure we have three kids and five parents more or less and i dont see why they shouldnt have five parents legally it also notes that her own brother is the father of her second wifes daughter i will simply leave that statement where it is and make very clear that our state department decided to honor this individual in this manner in our name 6 summer invaluable opportunity for teenagers to learn important life skills finally as the summer season looms before us and the fourth of july is coming quickly two articles on teenagers and the summer that are truly important the first of the articles is by carey restino of the anchorage daily news she writes that the summer is too often lost time for families when it comes to their children and especially their teenagers in terms of learning and yet she says these children are really not learning things they definitely need to know she writes it seems that in many families the parents role as a teacher has dimmed somewhat sure were aware that our children learn a great deal from us but more and more our culture expects others to teach our children the basic skills they need for life thats an amazingly profound statement and i cant think of many more paragraphs that would have greater importance to parents as we head with our children and teenagers in tow into the summer season and this columnist who is also a mom points out that many of these lessons simply arent known by children by the time they reach what is supposedly an adulthood for instance do they know anything about how to cook do they know how to clean a kitchen do they know how to clean a bathroom do they know how to iron a shirt do they know how to do anything in terms of the basic issues of life that parents used to believe were the responsibility of parents to teach their children she writes in her article about how shes going to have her children deployed in learning these lessons and she says its not just about them learning how to do the work she says if you think for a moment that this endeavors going to make my life easier this summer youre completely offbase i know that each of these lessons is going to be as much work for me if not more than for them but this summer is a great opportunity to focus on the job i signed up for—parenting and hopefully when they leave home they wont be as gobsmacked by the learning curve of life as i was thats a gift im willing to work hard to give them the second article appeared in the personal business column of the new york times on june 14 th the headline if a teenager lands a summer job the value is lasting even as the jobs report indicates that fewer teenagers than in any recent decade are now employed gainfully this summer the reality is that research is demonstrating over and over again the wisdom that a teenage summer job has lifelong consequences indeed researchers have demonstrated that teenagers who had some form of gainful employment during the summers of their teenage years earned far more in adulthood than teenagers who did not a study recently done by the metropolitan policy program of the brookings institution said there are good reasons for understanding this research shows those who work in high school have wages 10 to 15 percent higher when they graduate from college note that that comparison is based on wages immediately after graduating from college not to mention 20 or 30 years out one of the interesting insights in this article is that many other things that teenagers are doing good in themselves such as summer program summer school summer camp summer learning opportunities all of these can be important but as the research makes clear none of them can play quite as decisive a role in themselves as summer gainful employment a part of the reason for this was explained by john challenger who is an executive officer with a search firm that deals with employment issues he says real work experience is being displaced by summer and travel programs a lot of kids are missing out by not learning what working is theyre also missing the process of job hunting part of the experience is developing persistence and the allimportant skills of shaking hands answering questions clearly and looking someone in the eye but beyond that for many teenagers jobs as the new york times notes are much more important than an experience theyre a necessity but over the years lowerlevel jobs that were once the entryway to teenage employment have been displaced in this economy but one of the main points made by this new york times article by alina tugend is the fact that if you have a teenager and a bucket of water youve got a business and if you have a teenager and a lawnmower youve got an industry so taking these two articles together perhaps one of the most important things that parents can do with teenage children this summer is to make sure they are teaching them things they know they need to know and furthermore teaching them how to work because they know they need to work and if not able to find gainful employment they understand that if you cant find work you make work and thus we come to the end of the week with a stack of articles and issues yet to be discussed and thats just the way it is because today we also come to the end of the 20132014 season of the briefing ill be taking the month of july off and well return with the new season of the briefing and its daily edition every day of the work

            "text": "This is a rush transcript. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nIt’s Friday, June 27, 2014. I’m Albert Mohler and this is The Briefing, a daily analysis of news and events from a Christian worldview.\n\n1) Abortion counseling buffer zone law struck down in defense of free speech\n\nThe end of June brings a flurry of decisions by the United States Supreme Court. It ends its term as the summer begins. And as the term ends, a series of decisions are handed down that are likely to be remembered as the most important of the court’s term. Why? It’s because the court takes this time, the distance between the oral arguments in a case until the decision is handed down, to make certain that it has said what it wants to say when the decision is released. And the last of those decisions will be handed down next Monday, the last day of June and the last day of the court’s term.\n\nBut yesterday, there were important decisions handed down before the court went into a three-day recess. And among those two decisions, the most important is the fact that the court unanimously struck down a so-called buffer zone when it has to do with abortion counseling in the city of Boston and, by extension, to the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The court’s ruling was 9 to 0 in terms of the fact that the buffer zone, which prevented any kind of counseling of a woman against having an abortion, as being a violation of the basic American right, a fundamental right of free speech. But even as the decision was handed down on a 9-0 vote, what was behind the decision was a disagreement on the court as to how far the decision should reach. For example, the majority opinion struck down the fact that there could be a buffer zone that would privilege certain kinds of speech over against other speech when it comes to that 35-foot space that would include public sidewalks and public streets in front of any abortion clinic. The court did not strike down a similar law that would have allowed for this kind of buffer zone in front of any kind of medical facility, and the court majority insisted that this decision actually has nothing at all whatsoever to do with abortion. So what we have here is the court unanimously saying that what the Massachusetts law stipulated was unconstitutional, an unconstitutional abridgment of that basic American constitutional right of free speech.\n\nBut you also had a basic division on the court that made something else evident. The only way the court got to a 9-0 vote on this issue was by agreeing that this was not an abortion case. Had it been an abortion case, the liberals on the court would’ve found themselves in a duty-bound position by their own logic to defend abortion over against any kind of infringement. One of the most concerning aspects of the contemporary composition of the US Supreme Court is that those on the left are adamantly determined to defend abortion under virtually any conceivable circumstance, including even so-called partial-birth abortions.\n\nAs the hometown newspaper there in Massachusetts, The Boston Globe, declared, the US Supreme Court had ruled that the state laws violated the First Amendment, restricting access to public ways and sidewalks—and the keywords are what follows—places that are traditionally open for free debate. But the disagreement on the court itself, even behind the 9-0 ruling, was made evident in the concurring opinion that was handed down by Justice Antonin Scalia, who was joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Clarence Thomas. In his initial words in his concurring opinion, he said:\n\nToday’s opinion carries forward this court’s practice of giving abortion-rights advocates a pass when it comes to suppressing the free-speech rights of their opponents. There is an entirely separate abridged version of the First Amendment applicable to speech against abortion.\n\nNow I happen to believe that Justice Scalia is absolutely right in making this assertion. He’s right in suggesting that there’s something cowardly about a court that reaches the right decision by agreeing that the issue isn’t what the issue is actually about—in other words, abortion. Justice Scalia is counted in the unanimous vote—after all, it was 9-0—but he writes about the majority opinion, “This is an opinion that has something for everyone and the more significant portion continues the onward march of abortion speech only jurisprudence.”\n\nTime will tell whether or not in this case, as in so many others, Justice Scalia’s proved to be prophetic. But, at the very least, anyone who is concerned for the sanctity of human life has to see this as a win. It may turn out to be a narrow win, but it’s a very significant win, and since it was a unanimous decision, in that sense, it is a very conclusive win. The opportunity is now before the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to try to come back and rewrite the law so that it does not conflict with the United States Constitution, but the majority opinion, even with the criticisms of Justice Scalia, will be a mighty powerful obstacle for the state of Massachusetts to overcome in trying to craft just such a law.\n\n2) Separation of powers defended in court in America, not in battlefield\n\nIn a second major decision handed down by the court yesterday, the court rebuked the President of the United States. The court ruled that President Obama had overreached his constitutional authority by making certain so-called recess appointments when the Senate of the United States was not actually in recess. The court ruled unanimously that President Obama had innovated even over the practices of his predecessors by making appointments when the Senate actually wasn’t in recess, when it was just in something like a three-day holiday weekend. In other words, the president was acting over against the Constitution, was overreaching his constitutional authority in making certain appointments years ago to the National Labor Relations Board. And this is a far-reaching decision in this sense because this means that every one of the decisions made by that very important federal agency in the time since President Obama made those recess appointments is now in question because, as it turns out, those who were serving on the board were not qualified to do so. They had not been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nBy a narrower vote, in the second part of this decision, a 5-4 vote, a bare majority of the court decided not to virtually eliminate the president’s recess appointment power altogether. That’s also very telling. It tells us that there was only a one-vote margin separating those who were willing to say that in this age the president has no right of such recess appointments.\n\nSo it was a 9-0 decision on the big question and a 5-4 decision on the more narrow question, so what from the Christian worldview perspective is most important here? What’s important is the American genius of the constitutional separation of powers. We should stand back in a bit of wonder here and recognize that this is possible, this kind of decision, the framing of this kind of issue, only in the United States of America and only under the American Constitution. The United States Constitution that is to this day the longest-operating written Constitution in the history of humanity. And we need also to recognize that there was a deep Christian wisdom written into that separation of powers. That deep Christian wisdom is the understanding that evil tends to collect itself where power is unchecked, and it is the doctrine of sin that led the founders of this country to believe that every branch of government needed to be co-equal, able to check any overreach by another power. And in this case, it’s a very interesting three-part discussion because you had the Supreme Court of the United States, an equal branch of government with Congress and the president, instructing the President of the United States that he had acted unconstitutionally in not allowing the Congress of the United States the opportunity to review and to consent to his appointments.\n\nAlso making news in terms of the separation of powers, this week the Speaker the House of Representatives, John Boehner, announced that he will sue President Obama by the use of executive actions that go around the authority of Congress. And this will again demonstrate the separation of powers with the Speaker of the House suing the President of the United States before a federal court.\n\nFrom a Christian worldview perspective, there’s something else that needs to be noted here. Many other nations would go to war over this. There would be an attempted coup or some kind of toppling of the power structure. In the United States of America, one of the wonders of our constitutional system and its longevity is the fact that even when the disagreements run this deep, people go court, not to war.\n\n3) Edie Windsor celebrated by Bill Clinton, the president who signed DOMA\n\nYesterday marked the one-year anniversary of the Windsor decision handed down by the United States Supreme Court. That was the decision that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. I was asked by CNN to respond on that one-year anniversary. My article appeared today at CNN.com. But yesterday, on that one-year anniversary, there was a bizarre cover story, front-page story, at USA Today, and yet, very few people seemed to have noted just how bizarre it is. The article is by Richard Wolf, the lead reporter on this issue for USA Today. Here’s how he began the article:\n\nEdie Windsor turned 85 last week, but she was too “overdone” for a party. The woman whose lawsuit forced the federal government to recognize same-sex marriage introduced President Obama at a Democratic National Committee event a few nights earlier. A few nights later, she was to be introduced by former president Bill Clinton at an MTV “Trailblazers” event.\n\nNow as you heard her name, Edie Windsor is the reason why the Windsor decision has its name. It was she who sued against the federal government’s Defense of Marriage Act, and she won in court and it was thus struck down. That will stand as one of the most signal decisions of the United States Supreme Court, and to those who believe that marriage, by God’s intention, should be the union of a man and a woman, one of the most devastating judicial actions ever undertaken.\n\nBut what makes this story so interesting were those last words in that introductory paragraph. Let me read them again: “A few nights earlier, she was to be honored by former President Bill Clinton at an MTV “Trailblazers” event.” Where’s the irony there? Well Edie Windsor sued the government of the United States over the Defense of Marriage Act, claiming the Defense of Marriage Act was a basic denial of her basic human rights and winning her argument at the nation’s highest court, striking down a law that had been overwhelmingly passed by Congress and signed into law by the then president of the United States. That’s the irony. The President of the United States in 1996, the president who signed that bill into the law, was Bill Clinton, who was supposedly, according to USA Today, introducing her to be celebrated at a “Trailblazers” event on MTV. He was supposed to be celebrating her for having overturned the law that he signed into law in 1996. It takes someone like Bill Clinton to be able to pull that off; to be on both sides of the same issue on MTV.\n\nOn yesterday’s edition of The Briefing, we talked about another judicial decision. That was the decision at the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver that struck down Utah’s constitutional amendment against same-sex marriage. We covered the issue then, but something of additional interest has come to light. We mentioned yesterday that that’s the first US Court of Appeals to come to this kind of decision and that sets up the likelihood that the issue will arrive at the US Supreme Court as early as this coming fall.\n\nBut what brings me back to the issue today is the subsequent coverage. In particular, an article that appeared from the Associated Press; an article the reveals far more than may have been intended. The Associated Press reports:\n\nA federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that states must allow gay couples to marry, finding the Constitution protects same-sex relationships, and putting a remarkable legal winning streak across the country one step closer to the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe three-judge panel in Denver ruled two to one that states cannot deprive people of the fundamental right to marry simply because they want to be wedded to someone of the same-sex.\n\nBut then note with great care the words that follow:\n\nThe judges added they don’t want to brand as intolerant those who oppose gay marriage, but they said there’s no reasonable objection to the practice.\n\nSo the summary here offered by the Associated Press comes down to the fact that the two winning judges on the three-judge panel deciding this issue decided that they didn’t want to call people who oppose same-sex marriage intolerant, but in the very next statement they say there’s no reasonable objection to the practice. In their opinion, the judges actually said:\n\nIt is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite sex couples.\n\nNow that’s an interesting statement in itself. It actually doesn’t even reach to the actual reason why those who oppose same-sex marriage are opposed to it, but what’s far more interesting is the reading of motivations behind it. That here you have the Associated Press, apparently objectively trying to tell us what’s happening in this story, explaining that the two judges on the winning side of this three-judge panel said that they didn’t want to brand those who oppose same-sex marriage as intolerant, so they came up with something else to say: we’re simply illogical, irrational, on the wrong side of history, on the wrong side of reason, on the wrong side of their two-judge majority.\n\nNext, as we go into the weekend, I must report on an event that recently took place at the United States State Department, presided over by the Secretary of State of the United States, John Kerry. We’re indebted to the reportorial website Breitbart for bringing to our attention the fact that this event was held. It was an event celebrating LGBT issues at the United States State Department and the elevation of those issues in American foreign policy under the administration of Barack Obama and under the leadership of Secretary John Kerry. But as Breitbart reports, one of the speakers was journalist and LGBT activist Masha Gessen, who has been an outspoken critic of the Russian government on LGBT issues. She’s written a book about Vladimir Putin, for a time she headed the Moscow office of US Radio Liberty, and she’s been a prolific commentator to the New York Times blogs. Secretary of State John Kerry introduced her by saying:\n\nThe government in Moscow may look at Masha as a troublemaker to contend with, but here in the United States, we know that she is a wonderful person, a mother, a journalist, an extraordinary human rights defender, and we’re honored by her presence here.\n\nShe was indeed lauded by the United States State Department at this public event as one who symbolizes the kinds of gains that the gay-rights movement has made, not only in the United States, but internationally in recent years. She has moved with her partner and their children to the United States.\n\nBut what the State Department did not draw attention to is something else for which Masha Gessen is known. She has not only called for the legalization of same-sex marriage; she has called for the end of marriage altogether. She has said:\n\nI agree that we should have the right to marry, but I also think equally that it is a no-brainer that the institution of marriage should not exist. Fighting for gay marriage generally involves lying about what we’re going to do with marriage when we get there because we lie that the institution of marriage is not going to change, and that is a lie. The institution of marriage is going to change and it should change, and, again, I don’t think it should exist.\n\nSo the United States State Department, at an event presided over by the United States Secretary of State, honored someone who has called for the legalization of same-sex marriage as a way of getting to the elimination of marriage altogether, and who makes the argument that it’s only honest for same-sex marriage advocates to make very clear that their position is calling for same-sex marriage only until they can destroy marriage altogether.\n\nThe state department also did not draw attention to what Masha Gessen has described in her own words as a complicated family structure: “We have three kids and five parents, more or less, and I don’t see why they shouldn’t have five parents legally.” It also notes that her own brother is the father of her second wife’s daughter. I will simply leave that statement where it is and make very clear that our State Department decided to honor this individual in this manner in our name.\n\nFinally, as the summer season looms before us and the Fourth of July is coming quickly, two articles on teenagers and the summer that are truly important. The first of the articles is by Carey Restino of The Anchorage Daily News. She writes that the summer is too often lost time for families when it comes to their children and especially their teenagers, in terms of learning, and yet she says these children are really not learning things they definitely need to know. She writes:\n\nIt seems that in many families, the parents role as a teacher has dimmed somewhat. Sure we’re aware that our children learn a great deal from us, but more and more, our culture expects others to teach our children the basic skills they need for life.\n\nThat’s an amazingly profound statement, and I can’t think of many more paragraphs that would have greater importance to parents as we head, with our children and teenagers in tow, into the summer season. And this columnist, who is also a mom, points out that many of these lessons simply aren’t known by children by the time they reach what is supposedly an adulthood. For instance, do they know anything about how to cook? Do they know how to clean a kitchen? Do they know how to clean a bathroom? Do they know how to iron a shirt? Do they know how to do anything in terms of the basic issues of life that parents used to believe were the responsibility of parents to teach their children? She writes in her article about how she’s going to have her children deployed in learning these lessons and she says it’s not just about them learning how to do the work. She says:\n\nIf you think for a moment that this endeavor’s going to make my life easier this summer, you’re completely off-base. I know that each of these lessons is going to be as much work for me, if not more, than for them, but this summer is a great opportunity to focus on the job I signed up for—parenting. And hopefully, when they leave home, they won’t be as gobsmacked by the learning curve of life as I was. That’s a gift I’m willing to work hard to give them.\n\nThe second article appeared in the personal business column of The New York Times on June 14th. The headline: “If a Teenager Lands a Summer Job, the Value is Lasting.” Even as the jobs report indicates that fewer teenagers than in any recent decade are now employed gainfully this summer, the reality is that research is demonstrating over and over again the wisdom that a teenage summer job has lifelong consequences. Indeed, researchers have demonstrated that teenagers who had some form of gainful employment during the summers of their teenage years earned far more in adulthood than teenagers who did not. A study recently done by the Metropolitan Policy Program of the Brookings Institution said there are good reasons for understanding this. “Research shows those who work in high school have wages 10 to 15 percent higher when they graduate from college.” Note that that comparison is based on wages immediately after graduating from college, not to mention 20 or 30 years out.\n\nOne of the interesting insights in this article is that many other things that teenagers are doing, good in themselves, such as summer program, summer school, summer camp, summer learning opportunities, all of these can be important, but as the research makes clear, none of them can play quite as decisive a role in themselves as summer gainful employment. A part of the reason for this was explained by John Challenger, who is an executive officer with a search firm that deals with employment issues. He says:\n\nReal work experience is being displaced by summer and travel programs. A lot of kids are missing out by not learning what working is. They’re also missing the process of job hunting. Part of the experience is developing persistence and the all-important skills of shaking hands, answering questions clearly, and looking someone in the eye.\n\nBut, beyond that, for many teenagers, jobs, as The New York Times notes, are much more important than an experience; they’re a necessity. But over the years, lower-level jobs that were once the entryway to teenage employment have been displaced in this economy. But one of the main points made by this New York Times article by Alina Tugend is the fact that if you have a teenager and a bucket of water, you’ve got a business, and if you have a teenager and a lawnmower, you’ve got an industry.\n\nSo taking these two articles together, perhaps one of the most important things that parents can do with teenage children this summer is to make sure they are teaching them things they know they need to know. And furthermore, teaching them how to work because they know they need to work, and if not able to find gainful employment, they understand that if you can’t find work, you make work.\n\nAnd thus we come to the end of the week with a stack of articles and issues yet to be discussed, and that’s just the way it is because today we also come to the end of the 2013-2014 season of The Briefing. I’ll be taking the month of July off and we’ll return with the new season of The Briefing and its daily edition, every day of the work week, beginning on Monday, August 4 of this year.\n\nI just want to tell you how much I appreciate the fact you listen to The Briefing, and I surely hope you find this helpful in terms of your own life, your own thinking, and your own family, your own church as well.

10th circuit court of appeals decision that says the state can not deny residents the benefit or protection of marriage based on gender wednesdays 21 ruling affirmed a lower court decision by us district judge robert j shelby that overturned utahs voterapproved amendment 3 which defines marriage as between a man and a woman the utah attorney generals office said it will appeal to the high court but did not rule out the possibility of first asking the full 10th circuit court to review the case utah gov gary herbert said the appellate courts decision needs to be appealed because we cant get finality and final resolution unless the supreme court hears the case and makes a decision halting the states defense of the voterapproved amendment 3 to utahs constitution passed by 66 percent of voters in 2004 would be like stopping a game in the middle of the contest he said this was a 21 decision so at least a judge agrees with the states decision and you cant stop in the middle youve got to play until the final buzzer herbert said following the release of the opinion plaintiffs attorney peggy tomsic said she the three samesex couples who brought the case and other counsel shed tears of joy over wednesdays ruling this decision is an absolute victory for fairness and equality for all families in utah in every state in the 10th circuit and every state in this great nation of the united states she said from a human standpoint the 10th circuit as we all have believed from day one validated the united states constitution that the 14th amendment applies to all of us with equal force no matter what your sexual orientation and it is the first federal appellate court to ever hold that samesex couples have a constitutional due process right to marry the person whom they choose no matter their gender but the ruling also brought a defense of state rights tenth circuit court of appeals judge paul j kelly jr dissented from judge carlos lucero and judge jerome holmes in the ruling noting we should resist the temptation to become philosopherkings imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the 14th amendment kelly wrote in a 21page dissent if the states are laboratories of democracy requiring every state to recognize samegender unions — contrary to the views of its electorate and representatives — turns the notion of limited government on its head he wrote marriage is an important social institution commonly understood to protect this and future generations that states sincerely differ about the best way to do this is inevitable the

march 2013 archer and call joined the suit to have their iowa marriage recognized in utah shelby overturned the utah law in december ruling that it violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th amendment of the us constitution the state appealed shelbys decision and obtained a stay from the us supreme court but not before about 1300 samesex couples were married in utah over a 17day period the stay remains in place following wednesdays ruling although the courts 21 split decision does not favor the state we are pleased that the ruling has been issued and takes us one step closer to reaching certainty and finality for all utahns on such an important issue with a decision from the highest court a statement from the utah attorney generals office said the appellate court in a 65page opinion held that the 14th amendment protects the fundamental right to marry establish a family raise children and enjoy full protection of a states marital laws a state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons or refuse to recognize their marriage based solely on the sex of the persons in the marriage union according to the majority opinion plaintiffs seek to enter into legally recognized marriages with all the constitutional rights and responsibilities enshrined in utah law they desire not to redefine the institution but to participate in it the court found the states assertion that samesex couples are excluded from marriage by definition is wholly circular nothing logically or physically precludes samesex couples from marrying as is amply demonstrated by the fact that many states now permit such marriages according to the opinion written by lucero and joined by holmes the appeals courts emphasized as shelby did in his ruling that the decision relates solely to civil marriage plaintiffs must be accorded the same legal status as presently granted to married couples but religious institutions remain as free as they always have been to practice their sacraments and traditions as they see fit the judges wrote historymaking case the utah case marks the first time that a federal appellate court has struck down a samesex marriage ban it is among several cases nationwide at that stage and it is assumed that one of those will eventually make its way to the us supreme court in his dissent kelly acknowledged that samesex marriage is a highly emotional and important question of public policy but not a difficult question of constitutional law at least when it comes to the states right to enact laws preserving or altering the traditional composition of marriage the constitution is silent on the regulation of marriage that power is reserved to the states albeit consistent with federal constitutional guarantees he wrote to the extent that there is no right to samegender marriage emanating from the 14th amendment a state should not be compelled to recognize it according to kelly and while the court has recognized a fundamental right to marriage every decision vindicating that right has involved two persons of the opposite gender he wrote indeed the court has been less solicitous of plural marriages or polygamy if the states dont have the right to limit marriages kelly questioned whether utah can prohibit bigamy — a proposition that has been soundly rejected likewise utah would be hardpressed to prohibit marriages for minors under 15 and impose conditions for other minors he wrote matthew franck director of the william e and carol g simon center on religion and the constitution at the witherspoon institute said he was heartened by kellys dissent kellys opinion is a model of judicial restraint im afraid that luceros opinion was a model of the opposite of judicial activism and a willful overreaching of judicial authority the good news he said was that the panel stayed its ruling so there wont be any pitching headlong over a cliff into samesex marriages being performed today or tomorrow in utah thats at least forestalled that was responsible some of lower courts have declined to stay their rulings tomsic meanwhile said she gave the 10th circuit enormous respect for not only intellectually being honest but writing a very deep and analytical decision supporting their finding that judge shelby was right that amendment 3 and these marriage discrimination laws violate due process and equal protection derek kitchen one of the plaintiffs said the court system treated samesex couples with dignity it feels wonderful to be among one of the many many samesex couples across the country that are being respected and theyre offered dignity by the court system this is just emblematic of the united states judicial process and its an honor and im so humbled and proud to be here kitchen said at a press conference wednesday afternoon stay impacts six states utah is one of 33 states to have banned samesex marriage either through its constitution or by statute in 2004 utahns approved the amendment to the states constitution and its traditional definition of marriage wednesdays ruling is the first federal appellate court decision since the us supreme court last summer struck down a key provision of the defense of marriage act in us v windsor if not for the stay the ruling would become law in the six states of the 10th circuits jurisdiction — colorado kansas new mexico oklahoma utah and wyoming new mexicos supreme court has already legalized gay marriage in that state reaction to the decision was swift and divided the church of jesus christ of latterday saints in a statement posted on its website said the church has been consistent in its support of marriage between a man and a woman and teaches that all people should be treated with respect in anticipation that the case will be brought before the us supreme court it is our hope that the nations highest court will uphold traditional marriage meanwhile chad griffin president of the human rights campaign said the decision affirms that the us constitution guarantees the basic civil rights of all americans not just some utahs ban on marriage equality does nothing to strengthen or protect any marriage instead it singles out thousands of loving utah families for unfair treatment simply because of who they are our constitution does not allow for such blatant discrimination griffin said but robert george princeton university professor of politics who served as a presidential appointee to the us commission on civil rights and a judicial fellow at the supreme court described the appellate decision as a crime with two victims the first victim is the institution of marriage itself which is redefined to remove its conjugal nature and to replace it with a counterfeit conception of marriage as a form of sexualromantic companionship or domestic partnership the second victim is the principle of selfgovernment said george who is a past chairman of the national organization for marriage which advocates for traditional marriage and is a member of the deseret news editorial advisory board appeal will follow the decision by utah attorney general sean reyes to seek an appeal is vitally important not only to the institution of marriage itself which has served mankind so well for so long but to the institutions of selfgovernment george said sen orrin hatch rutah said he was not surprised by the ruling but he disagreed with the courts reasoning and hopes the supreme court will allow states to define marriage although i oppose discrimination based on sexual orientation i have always believed that marriage is a sacred union between one man and one woman hatch said in my view the us constitution does not dictate a particular definition of marriage so i believe such judgments are properly left to the citizens of each state the sutherland institute expressed disappointment at the decision for overriding the decision of utah voters to preserve marriage as societys way of preserving childrens opportunity to be reared by a mother and a father weve long known that this issue will have to be resolved by the us supreme court the utahbased conservative think tank said in a statement were grateful that utah will have the opportunity to make its case to the top court that utah voters deserve selfdetermination to decide a matter crucial to the state and its citizens any appeal at the us supreme court is the main event and may decide the future of marriage for decades defenders of marriage must be prepared and sutherland institute has laid the groundwork ensuring that top legal minds have compiled every constructive and effective argument to give our side the best chance of winning john mejia legal director for the american civil liberties union of utah said the ruling could help the pending lawsuit in utahs federal court seeking recognition of the marriages of samesex couples who were wed before the supreme court issued a stay everything is in flux but i think the overall message today is marriage equality is marching on mejia said he said he was disappointed that wednesdays ruling in the amendment 3 case left the stay in place charles stormont democratic candidate for utah attorney general called amendment 3 and other bans on samesex marriage illegal and unconstitutional and said he would not defend utahs constitutional amendment

That states sincerely differ about the best way to do this is inevitable.\"\n\nPlaintiffs Derek Kitchen and Moudi Sbeity, Laurie Wood and Kody Partridge, and Karen Archer and Kate Call challenged Amendment 3 defining marriage as between a man and a woman in federal court in March 2013. Archer and Call joined the suit to have their Iowa marriage recognized in Utah.\n\nShelby overturned the Utah law in December, ruling that it violates the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The state appealed Shelby's decision and obtained a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court, but not before about 1,300 same-sex couples were married in Utah over a 17-day period.\n\nThe stay remains in place following Wednesday's ruling.\n\n\"Although the court’s 2-1 split decision does not favor the state, we are pleased that the ruling has been issued and takes us one step closer to reaching certainty and finality for all Utahns on such an important issue with a decision from the highest court,\" a statement from the Utah Attorney General's Office said.\n\nThe appellate court, in a 65-page opinion, held that \"the 14th Amendment protects the fundamental right to marry, establish a family, raise children and enjoy full protection of a state's marital laws. A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely on the sex of the persons in the marriage union.\"\n\nAccording to the majority opinion: \"Plaintiffs seek to enter into legally recognized marriages, with all the constitutional rights and responsibilities enshrined in Utah law. They desire not to redefine the institution but to participate in it.\"\n\nThe court found the state's assertion that same-sex couples are excluded from marriage by definition is \"wholly circular.\"\n\n\"Nothing logically or physically precludes same-sex couples from marrying, as is amply demonstrated by the fact that many states now permit such marriages,\" according to the opinion written by Lucero and joined by Holmes.\n\nThe appeals courts emphasized, as Shelby did in his ruling, that the decision relates solely to civil marriage.\n\n\"Plaintiffs must be accorded the same legal status as presently granted to married couples, but religious institutions remain as free as they always have been to practice their sacraments and traditions as they see fit,\" the judges wrote.\n\nThe Utah case marks the first time that a federal appellate court has struck down a same-sex marriage ban. It is among several cases nationwide at that stage, and it is assumed that one of those will eventually make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn his dissent, Kelly acknowledged that same-sex marriage is a highly emotional and important question of public policy, “but not a difficult question of constitutional law at least when it comes to the states’ right to enact laws preserving or altering the traditional composition of marriage.”\n\nThe Constitution is silent on the regulation of marriage, that power is reserved to the states, albeit consistent with federal constitutional guarantees, he wrote.\n\n\"To the extent that there is no right to same-gender marriage emanating from the 14th Amendment, a state should not be compelled to recognize it,\" according to Kelly.\n\n“And while the court has recognized a fundamental right to marriage, every decision vindicating that right has involved two persons of the opposite gender,\" he wrote. \"Indeed, the court has been less solicitous of plural marriages or polygamy.\"\n\nIf the states don’t have the right to limit marriages, Kelly questioned whether Utah can prohibit bigamy — a “proposition” that has been “soundly rejected.” Likewise, “Utah would be hard-pressed to prohibit marriages for minors under 15 and impose conditions for other minors,” he wrote.\n\nMatthew Franck, director of the William E. and Carol G. Simon Center on Religion and the Constitution at the Witherspoon Institute, said he was “heartened\" by Kelly's dissent.\n\n\"Kelly’s opinion is a model of judicial restraint. I’m afraid that Lucero’s opinion was a model of the opposite, of judicial activism and a willful overreaching of judicial authority.\"\n\nThe good news, he said, was that the panel stayed its ruling \"so there won’t be any pitching headlong over a cliff into same-sex marriages being performed today or tomorrow in Utah, that’s at least forestalled. That was responsible. Some of lower courts have declined to stay their rulings.\"\n\nTomsic, meanwhile, said she gave the 10th Circuit \"enormous respect for not only intellectually being honest, but writing a very deep and analytical decision supporting their finding that Judge Shelby was right, that Amendment 3 and these marriage discrimination laws violate due process and equal protection.\"\n\nDerek Kitchen, one of the plaintiffs, said the court system treated same-sex couples with dignity.\n\n\"It feels wonderful to be among one of the many, many same-sex couples across the country that are being respected and they’re offered dignity by the court system. This is just emblematic of the United States judicial process and it's an honor and I’m so humbled and proud to be here,\" Kitchen said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.\n\nUtah is one of 33 states to have banned same-sex marriage either through its constitution or by statute. In 2004, Utahns approved the amendment to the state's Constitution and its traditional definition of marriage.\n\nWednesday's ruling is the first federal appellate court decision since the U.S. Supreme Court last summer struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act in U.S. v. Windsor.\n\nIf not for the stay, the ruling would become law in the six states of the 10th Circuit's jurisdiction — Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. New Mexico's Supreme Court has already legalized gay marriage in that state.\n\nReaction to the decision was swift and divided.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in a statement posted on its website, said: \"The Church has been consistent in its support of marriage between a man and a woman and teaches that all people should be treated with respect. In anticipation that the case will be brought before the U.S. Supreme Court, it is our hope that the nation’s highest court will uphold traditional marriage.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said the decision affirms that \"the U.S. Constitution guarantees the basic civil rights of all Americans, not just some.”\n\n“Utah’s ban on marriage equality does nothing to strengthen or protect any marriage. Instead, it singles out thousands of loving Utah families for unfair treatment simply because of who they are. Our Constitution does not allow for such blatant discrimination,\" Griffin said.\n\nBut Robert George, Princeton University professor of politics who served as a presidential appointee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and a judicial fellow at the Supreme Court, described the appellate decision as “a crime with two victims.”\n\n“The first victim is the institution of marriage itself, which is redefined to remove its conjugal nature and to replace it with a counterfeit conception of marriage as a form of sexual-romantic companionship or domestic partnership. The second victim is the principle of self-government,\" said George, who is a past chairman of the National Organization for Marriage, which advocates for traditional marriage, and is a member of the Deseret News Editorial Advisory Board.\n\nThe decision by Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes to seek an appeal is \"vitally important not only to the institution of marriage itself, which has served mankind so well for so long, but to the institutions of self-government,\" George said.\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he was not surprised by the ruling, but he disagreed with the court's reasoning and hopes the Supreme Court will allow states to define marriage.\n\n\"Although I oppose discrimination based on sexual orientation, I have always believed that marriage is a sacred union between one man and one woman,\" Hatch said. \"In my view, the U.S. Constitution does not dictate a particular definition of marriage, so I believe such judgments are properly left to the citizens of each state.\"\n\nThe Sutherland Institute expressed disappointment at the decision for overriding the decision of Utah voters “to preserve marriage as society’s way of preserving children’s opportunity to be reared by a mother and a father.\"\n\n\"We’ve long known that this issue will have to be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court,\" the Utah-based conservative think tank said in a statement. \"We’re grateful that Utah will have the opportunity to make its case to the top court that Utah voters deserve self-determination to decide a matter crucial to the state and its citizens.\n\n\"Any appeal at the U.S. Supreme Court is the main event and may decide the future of marriage for decades. Defenders of marriage must be prepared, and Sutherland Institute has laid the groundwork ensuring that top legal minds have compiled every constructive and effective argument to give our side the best chance of winning.\"\n\nJohn Mejia, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, said the ruling could help the pending lawsuit in Utah's federal court seeking recognition of the marriages of same-sex couples who were wed before the Supreme Court issued a stay.\n\n“Everything is in flux, but I think the overall message today is marriage equality is marching on,” Mejia said. He said he was disappointed that Wednesday’s ruling in the Amendment 3 case left the stay in place.\n\nCharles Stormont, Democratic candidate for Utah attorney general, called Amendment 3 and other bans on same-sex marriage \"illegal and unconstitutional\" and said he would not defend Utah's constitutional amendment if elected.\n\n\"I would immediately drop that case. It is a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources,\" Stormont said at an event to kick off his campaign. \"It is destroying families and that has to stop. We have to stand up for people's rights. We should not be fighting to take them away.\"",

            "text": "The head of the Family Research Council today blamed a string of pro-equality federal court rulings striking down same-sex marriage bans on President Obama's \"rising disdain for the rule of law.\"\n\nTony Perkins must be having conniptions over today's pro-equality rulings in Utah, Indiana, and even Louisiana. How else could anyone explain his official statement as the president of the Family Research Council today? Despite the fact that most of the rulings over the past year in support of same-sex marriage have come from federal judges nominated by Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan, Perkins believes that somehow President Barack Obama is to blame.\n\nCalling the pro-equality rulings \"a further attempt by the courts to untether our public policies from the democratic process, as well as the anthropological record,\" Perkins, the head of an anti-gay hate group who has a desire to become a U.S. Congressman and has coddled up to Gov. Bobby Jindal as his mentor to get him there, says that \"today’s rulings come as no surprise given the rising disdain for the rule of law promoted by the Obama administration.\"\n\nOf course, this must be placed in context. Today Speaker of the House John Boehner announced the House will sue President Obama over his executive orders, which the GOP claims are evidence of lawlessness.\n\nBut of course, in Perkins' world, God will have the final say.\n\n\"While judges can, by judicial fiat, declare same-sex ‘marriage’ legal, they will never be able to make it right,\" Perkins says today. \"The courts, for all their power, can’t overturn natural law. What they can do is incite a movement of indignant Americans, who are tired of seeing the foundations of a free and just society destroyed by a handful of black-robed tyrants. The Left has long believed packing the federal courts with liberal jurists is the means of fulfilling a radical social agenda, as the American people refuse to endorse that agenda at the polls or through their elected representatives.\"\n\nAnd despite the cold, hard fact that 56 to 59 percent of Americans support same-sex marriage, Perkins sees a conservative ground swell coming.\n\n\"As we saw with Roe v. Wade in 1973 - despite the Left’s earnest hopes, the courts do not have the final say. The American people will have the final word as they experience the consequences of marriage redefinition and the ways in which it fundamentally alters America’s moral, cultural and political landscape.\"",

            "text": "A federal appeals court ruled for the first time Wednesday that states cannot prevent gay couples from getting married, extending the movement’s legal winning streak and bringing the issue a big step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe three-judge panel in Denver ruled 2-1 that states cannot deprive people of the fundamental right to marry simply because they choose a partner of the same sex.\n\n“It is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples,” the judges wrote, addressing arguments that the ruling could undermine traditional marriage.\n\nThe decision by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld a lower-court ruling that struck down Utah’s gay marriage ban. It becomes law in the six states covered by the 10th Circuit: Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. But the panel immediately put the ruling on hold pending an appeal.\n\nThe Utah attorney general’s office planned to appeal the decision but it was assessing whether to go directly to the U.S. Supreme Court or ask the entire 10th Circuit to review the ruling, spokeswoman Missy Larsen said.\n\nWednesday’s decision “takes us one step closer to reaching certainty and finality,” the office said in a statement.\n\nAfter the ruling, the couples named in the appeal hugged, cried and exchanged kisses at a news conference outside their attorney’s offices in downtown Salt Lake City.\n\n“This decision is an absolute victory for fairness and equality for all families in Utah, in every state in the 10th Circuit and every state in this great nation of the United States,” said their attorney, Peggy Tomsic.\n\nPlaintiff Derek Kitchen said he and his partner, Moudi Sbeity, are “so proud to be a part of history.”\n\nThe decision gives increased momentum to a legal cause that already has compiled an impressive record in the lower courts after the Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates.\n\nThe latest of those rulings was in Indiana, where a federal judge threw out that state’s same-sex marriage ban Wednesday in a decision that immediately allows gay couples to wed. The Indiana and Utah rulings came just one day ahead of the first anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision striking down part of a federal anti-gay marriage law.\n\nThe Utah ruling is especially significant because it is the first appellate court to conclude that last year’s Supreme Court decision means states cannot deny gays the ability to marry.\n\nIn 2012, an appellate court struck down California’s gay marriage ban but said it was only ruling on that law, not the broader constitutional questions. There were no such caveats in Wednesday’s 65-page decision.\n\nEvan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, said Utah’s legal victory was sweeter because of where it originated — a conservative, deeply religious state in the heart of the mountain West.\n\n“What is so powerful here is that we have the first federal appellate court and … it’s a case coming out of Utah affirming in the strongest, clearest, boldest terms that the Constitution guarantees the freedom to marry and equal protection for all Americans and all means all, including gay couples,” he said.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, said on its website that it maintains marriage should be between a man and a woman, but believes “all people should be treated with respect.”\n\nIn his dissent, Justice Paul J. Kelly Jr. said the 10th Circuit overstepped its authority and that states should be able to decide who can marry.\n\n“We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of the 14th Amendment,” Kelly wrote.\n\nMore than 1,000 Utah same-sex couples wed in December after the initial ruling in the case, before the Supreme Court issued a stay.",

may that it was almost a certainty that gay marriage will become legal that said he still expressed disappointment at the 10th circuits actions although i am not surprised by todays decision i disagree with the courts reasoning and hope the supreme court ultimately adheres to the original understanding of the constitution and allow each state to define marriage for itself he said rep rob bishop rutah said utahns have made clear their wishes on this subject and their wishes should not be superseded by a judge additionally protecting the 1st amendment and religious institutions rights and ability to uphold and act in accordance with their beliefs and principles must be a priority the sutherland institute a conservative think tank promised to help gather a legal team to defend the states gay marriage ban any appeal at the us supreme court is the main event and may decide the future of marriage for decades according to a statement from sutherland defenders of marriage must be

not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons or refuse to recognize their marriage based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union the appellate court said courts do not sit in judgment of the hearts and minds of citizens the majority judges attacked the states arguments which centered largely around how samesex marriage affects childrearing and religious freedom the judges wrote that the states arguments rested on a link between marriage and procreation — an argument that they said failed because oppositesex couples who do not or can not procreate are still allowed to marry utah citizens may choose a spouse of the opposite sex regardless of the pairings procreative capacity the opinion reads the elderly those medically unable to conceive and those who exercise their fundamental right not to have biological children are free to marry and have their outofstate marriages recognized in utah apparently without breaking the conceptual link between

jerome a holmes — about marriage studies jurisdiction and standard of scrutiny at that time kelly — who was the dissenting judge in wednesdays opinion — had asked the plaintiffs attorney hard questions about state authority kelly on wednesday disagreed that the fourteenth amendment requires utah to extend marriage to samesex couple or recognize those marriages from other states he noted that the us supreme court has recognized a fundamental right to marriage but said every decision vindicating that right has involved two oppositegender people indeed the court has been less than solicitous of plural marriages or polygamy kelly wrote if the states are the laboratories of democracy requiring every state to recognize samegender unions — contrary to the views of its electorate

prevail because the state has shown a rational basis for its decision — responsible procreation effective parenting and the desire to proceed cautiously with a new social phenomenon utahs

he also wrote we should resist the temptation to become philosopherkings imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the fourteenth amendment during the april arguments in denver tomsic had asked the judges to ensure marriage equality for all while the states lead attorney gene c schaerr asked them to preserve marriage rights only for oppositesex couples the state argued at that hearing that children benefit from being parented by a mother and a father not two mothers or two fathers but tomsic also argued that the case is about family she said couples want to provide for and protect each other legally and children are demeaned and humiliated when their parents are unable to marry and provide them with the benefits and protections associated with the civil institution rosky called wednesdays ruling a bipartisan decision noting that kelly was nominated to the bench by former president george hw bush lucero was nominated in by former president bill clinton and holmes was nominated by former president george w bush utah legislator jim dabakis who is openly gay and was married during the brief time in december when samesex marriage in utah was legal said of the ruling i am joyous as i know hundreds of thousands of lgbt folks and their families are all across the great state of utah this is a profamily decision and it fits squarely with true utah family values — love kindness and a fair playing field for all its wonderful to see utah once again lead the country in gay rights salt lake city mayor ralph becker said this is a great day for the laws of the united states but it still has a long way to go noting that the 10th circuit expects the supreme court to have the final say the mayor who helped marry gay couples in the hours after

            "text": "Courts » State of Utah will ruling appeal to U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nA federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled that states outlawing same-sex marriage are in violation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nBy upholding a Utah judge’s decision, a three-member panel of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver became the first appeals court in the nation to rule on the issue, setting a historic precedent that voter-approved bans on same-sex marriage violate the Fourteenth Amendment rights of same-sex couples to equal protection and due process.\n\nBut the court immediately stayed the implementation of its decision, pending an anticipated appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nUtah attorney general’s office said Wednesday it will initiate that appeal.\n\nMeanwhile, the state could ask the 10th Circuit Court to re-hear the matter before the full court.\n\nUniversity of Utah law professor Clifford Rosky called Wednesday’s ruling, \"the most important victory of the entire gay rights movement.\"\n\nIt is the first time a federal appeals court has recognized that same-sex couples have the same fundamental right to marry as all Americans, said Rosky, chairman of Equality Utah’s board of directors.\n\n\"Very few courts have embraced the fundamental rights argument and this court seems to have completely embraced it and applied ‘strict scrutiny,’ the highest standard recognized under constitutional law,\" Rosky said.\n\nIf the state asks the 10th Circuit Court to re-hear the matter before the full court of 12 judges, Rosky said he doubts they will get a different result, and the request may not even be granted.\n\nThe court’s two-to-one ruling affirms U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby’s December decision, which struck down Utah’s ban on same-sex marriage and prompted more than a 1,000 same-sex couples to marry during a 17-day window before the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay, halting all such weddings.\n\nWednesday’s decision \"certainly lends legal clarity at this stage,\" said Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill.\n\nBut it remains unclear what practical effect it will have, if any, Gill said.\n\nThe state of Utah now has 90 days to ask the high court to weigh in, Gill said. The only way that counties would be free to immediately start issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples would be if the state chooses not to petition the high court, he said.\n\n\"The ball really goes back to the state of Utah,\" Gill said.\n\nThe Utah attorney general’s office released this statement Wednesday: \"Although the Court’s 2-1 split decision does not favor the State, we are pleased that the ruling has been issued and takes us one step closer to reaching certainty and finality for all Utahns on such an important issue with a decision from the highest court.\n\n\"For that to happen, the Utah Attorney General’s Office intends to file a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. The Tenth Circuit Court’s issuance of a stay will avoid further uncertainty until the case is finally resolved. Whether the Utah Attorney General’s Office seeks en banc [full court] review of the Tenth Circuit’s ruling has yet to be determined.\"\n\nDespite the continuing uncertainty, attorney Peggy Tomsic, who represented the three same-sex couples who are plaintiffs in the Kitchen v. Herbert lawsuit that is the subject of Wednesday’s decision, called the ruling \"an absolute victory for fairness and equality\" for the people of Utah and other states in the 10th Circuit.\n\nPlaintiff’s Moudi Sbeity and Derek Kitchen, had posted this Facebook comment: \"Today is a great day for all that came before us, for all in the current trenches fighting for equality, and for all who are affected.\n\n\"The 10th Circuit upheld Judge Shelby’s ruling, affirming that the right to marry and love is a right guaranteed to all Americans,\" the couple said. \"Thank you all for the outpouring of love and support, and especially a huge thank you to our team and co-plaintiffs. Love on, Utah!\"\n\nMany conservatives in Utah were disheartened by the ruling, but they have not given up in their fight to keep marriage between a man and a woman.\n\nGov. Gary Herbert issued a statement saying he was disappointed.\"\n\n\"I believe states have the right to determine their laws regarding marriage. I am grateful the Court issued a stay to allow time to analyze the decision and our options. But as I have always said, all Utahns deserve clarity and finality regarding same-sex marriage and that will only come from the Supreme Court.\"\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch made headlines recently by saying in May that it was almost a certainty that gay marriage will become legal. That said, he still expressed disappointment at the 10th Circuit’s actions.\n\n\"Although I am not surprised by today’s decision, I disagree with the court’s reasoning and hope the Supreme Court ultimately adheres to the original understanding of the Constitution and allow each state to define marriage for itself,\" he said.\n\nRep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, said, \"Utahns have made clear their wishes on this subject and their wishes should not be superseded by a judge. Additionally, protecting the 1st Amendment and religious institutions’ rights and ability to uphold and act in accordance with their beliefs and principles must be a priority.\"\n\nThe Sutherland Institute, a conservative think tank, promised to help gather a legal team to defend the state’s gay marriage ban.\n\n\"Any appeal at the U.S. Supreme Court is the main event and may decide the future of marriage for decades,\" according to a statement from Sutherland. \"Defenders of marriage must be prepared. It’s disappointing to have a few federal judges decide that they can unilaterally override the decision of Utah voters to preserve marriage as society’s way of preserving children’s opportunity to be reared by a mother and father.\"\n\nThe ruling affects all states in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals: Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming.\n\nThe court’s majority opinion focused on the 14th Amendment, which gives equal protection to American citizens. The court said its reading of the Constitution shows that the legal rights of married couples has nothing to do with the gender of those in the union.\n\n\"We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right to marry, establish a family, raise children, and enjoy the full protection of a state’s marital laws. A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union,\" the appellate court said.\n\n\"Courts do not sit in judgment of the hearts and minds of citizens.\"\n\nThe majority judges attacked the state’s arguments, which centered largely around how same-sex marriage affects child-rearing and religious freedom.\n\nThe judges wrote that the state’s arguments rested on a link between marriage and procreation — an argument that they said failed because opposite-sex couples who do not or cannot procreate are still allowed to marry.\n\n\"Utah citizens may choose a spouse of the opposite sex regardless of the pairing’s procreative capacity,\" the opinion reads. \"The elderly, those medically unable to conceive, and those who exercise their fundamental right not to have biological children are free to marry and have their out-of-state marriages recognized in Utah, apparently without breaking the ‘conceptual link between marriage and procreation.’\"\n\nThe judges pointed out that the only reference to reproduction in Utah’s marriage law is a provision that allows first cousins to marry if they are over 65 years old or are over 55 and cannot reproduce.\n\nThe judges also emphasized that religious leaders are still free to practice their sacraments and traditions as they see fit, and are not required to allow same-sex marriage in their churches.\n\n\"We continue to recognize the right of the various religions to define marriage according to their moral, historical and ethical precepts,\" the opinion reads. \"Our opinion does not intrude into that domain or the exercise of religious principles in this arena. The right of an officiant to perform or decline to perform a religious ceremony in unaffected by today’s ruling.\"\n\nAlso Wednesday, a federal judge in Indianapolis struck down Indiana’s ban on same-sex marriage Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. The ruling took effect immediately, allowing same-sex couples to marry.\n\nThe 10th Circuit Court on Wednesday split along that same lines that were formed during oral arguments in April, with pointed questions asked by the three judges — Paul J. Kelly Jr., Carlos F. Lucero and Jerome A. Holmes — about marriage studies, jurisdiction and standard of scrutiny.\n\nAt that time, Kelly — who was the dissenting judge in Wednesday’s opinion — had asked the plaintiffs’ attorney hard questions about state authority.\n\nKelly on Wednesday disagreed that the Fourteenth Amendment requires Utah to extend marriage to same-sex couple or recognize those marriages from other states.\n\nHe noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized a fundamental right to marriage but said every decision vindicating that right has involved two opposite-gender people.\n\n\"Indeed, the Court has been less than solicitous of plural marriages or polygamy,\" Kelly wrote. \"If the States are the laboratories of democracy, requiring every state to recognize same-gender unions — contrary to the views of its electorate and representatives — [it] turns the notion of a limited national government on its head.\"\n\nMarriage does not exist in a vacuum and states have the right to regulate it, the judge said. He said Utah should prevail because the state has shown a rational basis for its decision — responsible procreation, effective parenting and the desire to proceed cautiously with a new social phenomenon.\n\n\"Utah’s justifications for not extending marriage to include same-gender couples are not irrefutable. But they don’t need to be; they need only be based upon ‘any reasonably conceivable state of facts,’ \" Kelly wrote.\n\nHe also wrote, \"We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nDuring the April arguments in Denver, Tomsic had asked the judges to ensure marriage equality for all, while the state’s lead attorney, Gene C. Schaerr, asked them to preserve marriage rights only for opposite-sex couples.\n\nThe state argued at that hearing that children benefit from being parented by a mother and a father, not two mothers or two fathers.\n\nBut Tomsic also argued that the case is about family. She said couples want to provide for and protect each other legally, and children are demeaned and humiliated when their parents are unable to marry and provide them with the benefits and protections associated with the civil institution.\n\nRosky called Wednesday’s ruling \"a bipartisan decision,\" noting that Kelly was nominated to the bench by former President George H.W. Bush, Lucero was nominated in by former President Bill Clinton and Holmes was nominated by former President George W. Bush.\n\nUtah legislator Jim Dabakis, who is openly gay and was married during the brief time in December when same-sex marriage in Utah was legal, said of the ruling: \"I am joyous, as I know hundreds of thousands of LGBT folks and their families are, all across the great state of Utah. This is a pro-family decision and it fits squarely with true Utah family values — love, kindness and a fair playing field for all. It’s wonderful to see Utah, once again lead the country in gay rights.\"\n\nSalt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker said, \"This is a great day for the laws of the United States, but it still has a long way to go,\" noting that the 10th Circuit expects the Supreme Court to have the final say.\n\nThe mayor, who helped marry gay couples in the hours after Judge Shelby’s ruling last December, noted that Utah’s key role in a legal process that may affect the entire nation.\n\nThe state \"is playing a leading role in one of the major issues in our day for social justice\" Becker said. \"For me, it is exciting.\"\n\nEvan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, released a statement saying that ruling \"has brought us one giant step closer to the day when all Americans will have the freedom to marry.

in a historic ruling that rejected utahs assertion that marriage between a man and woman best suits children and procreation by upholding a utah judges decision to strike down the states ban on samesex marriage a threemember panel of the 10th circuit court of appeals in denver became the first appeals court in the nation to rule on the issue the appeals court set a precedent by finding that

            "text": "Outlawing same-sex marriage violates citizens’ rights, a federal appeals court said Wednesday in a historic ruling that rejected Utah’s assertion that marriage between a man and woman best suits children and procreation.\n\nBy upholding a Utah judge’s decision to strike down the state’s ban on same-sex marriage, a three-member panel of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver became the first appeals court in the nation to rule on the issue.\n\nThe appeals court set a precedent by finding that voter-approved bans on same-sex marriage — such as Utah’s Amendment 3 — violate the constitutional rights of same-sex couples to equal protection and due process.\n\nBut the court immediately stayed the implementation of its decision pending an anticipated appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court — an appeal that will be initiated, the Utah Attorney’s General Office confirmed Wednesday.\n\nDespite the continuing uncertainty, attorney Peggy Tomsic, who represented the three same-sex couples who are plaintiffs in the Kitchen v. Herbert lawsuit that is the subject of Wednesday’s decision, called the ruling \"an absolute victory for fairness and equality\" for the people of Utah and other states in the 10th Circuit.\n\n\"We are overjoyed by the court’s decision, which means so much to us, our family and everyone who believes in justice and fairness,\" plaintiff Derek Kitchen said in a statement. \"Since the lawsuit was filed last year, we have received so much support from so many people in our state, and we are now looking forward to the day when we will finally be married.\"\n\nJoining Kitchen and Moudi Sbeity as plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Karen Archer and Kate Call and Laurie Wood and Kody Partridge.\n\nThe Utah Attorney General’s Office said in a statement that it will push to have the issue heard by the Supreme Court, but hasn’t decided whether it will ask for a full-court review by the 10th Circuit.\n\n\"Although the court’s 2-1 split decision does not favor the state, we are pleased that the ruling has been issued and takes us one step closer to reaching certainty and finality for all Utahns on such an important issue with a decision from the highest court,\" the statement reads.\n\nThe fact that Wednesday’s ruling is the first on the issue from a federal appeals court makes it especially important, said Carl Tobias, a judicial appointment expert and professor at the University of Richmond School of Law.\n\n\"It just has more authority [than a district court ruling] because it’s a three-judge panel in a higher court,\" Tobias said. \"Other appeals court will be influenced by [the 10th Circuit Court’s] reasoning.\"\n\nUniversity of Utah law professor Clifford Rosky called the ruling, \"the most important victory of the entire gay rights movement.\"\n\n\"Very few courts have embraced the fundamental rights argument and this court seems to have completely embraced it and applied ‘strict scrutiny,’ the highest standard recognized under constitutional law,\" said Rosky, chairman of the board of Equality Utah, which seeks to secure equal rights and protections for LGBT Utahns and their families.\n\nTobias said that when \"strict scrutiny\" is applied in this case, the state’s arguments — centered largely around how same-sex marriage affects child-rearing and religious freedom — don’t hold up.\n\n\"You give strict scrutiny to the state’s reasoning, [the judges] just found that none of them could withstand that level of scrutiny,\" Tobias said.\n\nThe majority opinion attacked the state’s arguments, which relied on a link between marriage and procreation. They said the argument failed because opposite-sex couples who do not or cannot procreate are still allowed to marry.\n\n\"Utah citizens may choose a spouse of the opposite sex regardless of the pairing’s procreative capacity,\" the opinion reads. \"The elderly, those medically unable to conceive and those who exercise their fundamental right not to have biological children are free to marry and have their out-of-state marriages recognized in Utah, apparently without breaking the ‘conceptual link between marriage and procreation.\"\n\nThe judges pointed out that the only reference to reproduction in Utah’s marriage law is a provision that allows first cousins to marry if they are over 65 years old, or are over 55 and cannot reproduce.\n\nThe court’s ruling affirms U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby’s Dec. 20 decision, which struck down Utah’s ban on same-sex marriage and prompted more than 1,000 same-sex couples to marry during a 17-day window before the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay, halting all such weddings.\n\nWednesday’s decision \"certainly lends legal clarity at this stage,\" Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said.\n\nBut it remains unclear what practical effect it will have, if any, Gill said.\n\nUtah now has 90 days to ask the high court to weigh in, Gill said.\n\nThe ruling disheartened many Utah conservatives, but they have not given up in their fight to keep marriage between a man and a woman.\n\nGov. Gary Herbert said he was disappointed with Wednesday’s ruling.\n\n\"I believe states have the right to determine their laws regarding marriage,\" he said. \"I am grateful the Court issued a stay to allow time to analyze the decision and our options. But as I have always said, all Utahns deserve clarity and finality regarding same-sex marriage and that will only come from the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe ruling affects all states in the 10th Circuit: Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming.\n\nThe court’s majority opinion focused on the 14th Amendment, which gives equal protection to American citizens. The court said its reading of the Constitution shows that the legal rights of married couples have nothing to do with the gender of those in the union.\n\n\"We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right to marry, establish a family, raise children, and enjoy the full protection of a state’s marital laws. A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union,\" the appellate court said.\n\nThe decision concludes: \"Courts do not sit in judgment of the hearts and minds of citizens.\"\n\nThe judges emphasized that religious leaders are still free to practice their sacraments and traditions as they see fit, and are not required to allow same-sex marriage in their churches.\n\n\"We continue to recognize the right of the various religions to define marriage according to their moral, historical and ethical precepts,\" the opinion reads. \"Our opinion does not intrude into that domain or the exercise of religious principles in this arena. The right of an officiant to perform or decline to perform a religious ceremony in unaffected by today’s ruling.\"\n\nThe ruling split along the same lines formed during oral arguments in April, when the three judges — Paul J. Kelly Jr., Carlos F. Lucero and Jerome A. Holmes — asked pointed questions about marriage studies, jurisdiction and standard of scrutiny.\n\nAt that time, Kelly — who was the dissenting judge in Wednesday’s opinion — had asked the plaintiffs’ attorney hard questions about state authority.\n\nKelly on Wednesday disagreed that the 14th Amendment requires Utah to extend marriage to same-sex couples or recognize such marriages from other states.\n\nHe noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized a fundamental right to marriage but said every decision vindicating that right has involved two opposite-gender people.\n\n\"Indeed, the Court has been less than solicitous of plural marriages or polygamy,\" Kelly wrote. \"If the States are the laboratories of democracy, requiring every state to recognize same-gender unions — contrary to the views of its electorate and representatives — [it] turns the notion of a limited national government on its head.\"\n\nMarriage does not exist in a vacuum and states have the right to regulate it, the judge added. He said Utah should prevail because the state has shown a rational basis for its decision to ban same-sex marriage — responsible procreation, effective parenting and the desire to proceed cautiously with a new social phenomenon.\n\n\"Utah’s justifications for not extending marriage to include same-gender couples are not irrefutable. But they don’t need to be; they need only be based upon ‘any reasonably conceivable state of facts,’ \" Kelly wrote.\n\nHe also wrote, \"We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nDuring the April arguments in Denver, Tomsic had asked the judges to ensure marriage equality for all, while the state’s lead attorney, Gene C. Schaerr, asked them to preserve marriage rights only for opposite-sex couples.\n\nThe state argued at that hearing that children benefit from being parented by a mother and a father, not two mothers or two fathers.\n\nBut Tomsic also argued that the case is about family. She said couples want to provide for and protect each other legally, and children are demeaned and humiliated when their parents are unable to marry and provide them with the benefits and protections associated with the civil institution.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union had submitted a \"friend of the court\" brief in support of the plaintiffs in the Kitchen v. Herbert lawsuit.\n\nThe ACLU also has filed a lawsuit in Utah’s federal court seeking recognition of the marriages of same-sex couples who were wed during the 17-day period when such marriages were legal.\n\nThough U.S. District Judge Dale A. Kimball ordered Utah in May to honor and recognize all same-sex marriages performed during the 17-day period, the 10th Circuit halted any movement toward marriage recognition by issuing a stay after the state filed notice that it would appeal Kimball’s order.\n\nReporters Marissa Lang, Pamela Manson and Kirsten Stewart contributed to this story.",

It was the first time an appellate court determined last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act means states cannot deny gays the ability to wed.\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel put its Oklahoma and Utah rulings on hold pending an appeal. Utah's attorney general has said he plans to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nGay marriage in the two states will remain on hold.\n\nStill, the decisions give increased momentum to a legal cause that has compiled an impressive string of lower court victories.

The rulings have come in 17 states, with Florida being the latest.\n\nTwo of the most striking of those decisions were in conservative Utah and Oklahoma, which saw their voter-approved gay marriage bans struck down in December and January, respectively. In Utah, more than 1,000 same-sex couples married before the Supreme Court issued a stay.\n\nIt's unclear whether the two cases will be the first to reach the Supreme Court.

            "text": "Both the majority and the dissenting opinions thoughtfully consider the question of same-sex marriage. Yet Kelly, who argues, “we should be reluctant to invalidate state constitutional or legislative enactments,” is more persuasive.\n\nWednesday’s split decision in favor of same-sex marriage by a panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sets up the opportunity for Utah’s traditional man-woman definition of marriage to be tested before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nTwo of the three judges upheld the lower federal court decision of Dec. 20, 2013, that had required the state to permit same-sex marriages prior to a stay by the U.S. Supreme Court. The appeals court judiciously stayed its decision until the Supreme Court decides whether to review the matter. Assuming the State of Utah seeks high court review, as indicated it will by Attorney General Sean Reyes, this stay precludes a reintroduction of same-sex marriages in Utah until the high court weighs in directly.\n\nWe support the reasoning of Judge Paul Kelly, who dissented from the majority opinion. Both the majority and the dissenting opinions thoughtfully consider the question of whether there is a right to same-sex marriage. Yet Kelly, who argues, “we should be reluctant to invalidate state constitutional or legislative enactments,” is more persuasive.\n\nThe majority acknowledges the Supreme Court precedent (Baker v. Nelson, from 1972) which holds that the issue of same-sex marriage is not a federal question. But the majority said that decision can be overlooked because of its procedural posture and in light of subsequent Supreme Court decisions. These decisions include the high court’s affirmation of the right of adults to consent to intimate homosexual relationships (in Lawrence v. Texas, 2003), and the federal government’s responsibility to recognize, for purposes of federal law, state-sanctioned same-sex marriages (in Windsor v. U.S., 2013). In striking down a portion of the federal Defense of Marriage Act last year, the Windsor decision has inspired dozens of legal battles over the separate question: Is a state constitutionally required to recognize same-gender marriages?\n\nThe majority on the appeals court said that “the right to marry is a fundamental liberty.” It refers back to decisions permitting inter-racial marriage, marriage by a prisoner, and marriage by a “dead-beat dad.” In all those cases, the marriages at issue were marriages between a man and a woman. Yet drawing on the implications of the 2003 and 2013 Supreme Court decisions, the majority leapt to the conclusion that same-sex marriages need to be accorded the same legal recognition as man-woman marriages.\n\nThis reasoning is incomplete. It does not acknowledge the way marriage has consistently been understood by law and culture. It does not respect the bounds of federalism. And it arrogates to the judiciary powers that are best left to the democratic institutions of government.\n\nFortunately, Kelly's dissent puts precedent, procedure and principle into proper context: An appeals court is not free to disregard a Supreme Court decision directly addressing an issue. “To the extent there is no right to same-gender marriage emanating from the Fourteenth Amendment, a state should not be compelled to recognize it.”\n\nKelly also highlighted how the proponents of same-gender marriage have misappropriated the goodwill associated with the word “marriage” in seeking to obtain a right not found in the Constitution. “Indeed, this case is better understood as an effort to extend marriage to persons of the same gender by redefining marriage.\"\n\nThe opponents of traditional marriage, Kelly wrote, “contend that freedom to marry is self-defining and without reference to those who assert it or have been excluded from it. Of course, the difficulty with this is that marriage does not exist in a vacuum; it is a public institution, and states have the right to regulate it. That right necessarily encompasses the right to limit marriage and decline to recognize marriages which would be prohibited.” He opposed the judicial effort to require states to change their laws on marriage and make it into what he called a “freestanding right” for consenting adults.\n\nKelly continued: “recognition of fundamental rights requires a right deeply rooted in United States history and tradition, and a careful and precise definition of the right at issue.” There is no such history or tradition supporting a redefinition of marriage, and therefore, he said, “we should be reluctant to announce a fundamental right by implication.”\n\nKelly’s final sentence is worth repeating as this case goes to the next level of review: “We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.”",

            "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Same-sex couples eager to wed in Indiana after a federal judge overturned the state’s ban on gay marriage are waiting to see how the judge responds to a request that he stay his order while the attorney general appeals.\n\nHundreds of same-sex couples lined up at courthouses across the state Wednesday for marriage licenses and impromptu weddings after U.S. District Judge Richard Young ruled that the state’s ban was unconstitutional.\n\nBut the state moved swiftly to halt those unions, arguing in its request for a stay that it was “premature to require Indiana to change its definition of marriage” while it appeals the ruling.\n\nLegal experts predicted Young would rule within a week on the request.\n\nAttorneys on both sides of the gay marriage debate expect the issue to ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates, but many of those are being appealed.\n\nBut even if their victory celebration is cut short, Indiana gay-rights supporters say Young’s ruling is an important step forward.\n\n“The reason things are changing is because we’re out, and because people are getting to know us because we’re out there and we have normal lives and normal families,” said Melody Layne, a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits challenging Indiana’s ban. Layne married her partner, Tara Betterman, in New York , and they have a daughter.\n\nIndiana law defines marriage as between a man and a woman, and the state has refused to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states where it is legal. Young’s ruling changes that and also allows same-sex couples to file joint tax returns, receive pension benefits and have their partners listed as spouses on death certificates.\n\nYoung found that Indiana’s ban on gay marriage violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution and bucked the tide of history, citing similar rulings in other federal court districts.\n\n“These couples, when gender and sexual orientation are taken away, are in all respects like the family down the street. The Constitution demands that we treat them as such,” Young wrote.",

            "text": "11:50 a.m.: Utah's attorney general plans to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a ruling Wednesday that found states must allow gay couples to marry.\n\nRepublican Sean Reyes' office said in a statement Wednesday it will file a petition to have the country's highest court review the decision by a three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver.\n\nThe office also left open the possibility of requesting a review from the full panel of judges at the 10th Circuit.\n\nThe attorney general's office says even though the 10th Circuit ruling went against Utah, the state is pleased that it moves the important issue one step closer to the Supreme Court.\n\nEarlier: Courts struck down bans on same-sex marriages in two different states on Wednesday.\n\nIn Utah, a federal appeals court ruled for the first time that states must allow gay couples to marry, finding the Constitution protects same-sex relationships and putting a remarkable legal winning streak across the country one step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision upheld a lower court ruling that struck down Utah's gay marriage ban.\n\nIn Indiana, U.S. District Judge Richard Young on Wednesday struck down that state's same-sex marriage ban in a ruling that immediately allows gay couples to wed.\n\nThe three-judge panel in Denver found it \"wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of the love and commitment between same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples.\"\n\nHowever, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel immediately put Wednesday's ruling on hold so it could be appealed, either to the entire 10th Circuit or directly to the nation's highest court.\n\n\"All I can say is that we are thrilled,\" said Kody Partridge, one of the Utah plaintiffs. She was working in the garden with her wife, Laurie Wood, when they heard about the ruling.\n\n\"This is such as historic thing, not just for Utah but for Laurie and me\" and plaintiffs across the country, Partridge said. \"This is a big day.\"\n\nThe decision gives increased momentum to a legal cause that already compiled an impressive winning streak in the lower courts after the Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates.\n\nThe latest of those rulings was in Indiana. That ruling involves lawsuits filed by several gay couples, who along with the state had asked for a summary judgment in the case.\n\nThe clerk in Marion County, home to Indianapolis, says the office will start issuing marriage licenses immediately.\n\nThe Indiana attorney general's office said it would appeal the ruling but declined further comment.\n\n\"Indiana now joins the momentum for nationwide marriage equality and Hoosiers can now proclaim they are on the right side of history,\" Lambda Legal, the national gay rights group that represented five of the couples, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nA movement to add a gay marriage ban to the Indiana constitution faltered during this legislative session when lawmakers removed language about civil unions from the amendment. That means the soonest the issue could appear on a ballot is 2016, unless federal court rulings scuttle the proposed amendment.\n\nAnd on to the Supreme Court?\n\nTwo of the most striking lower court rulings were in the conservative states of Utah and Oklahoma, which saw their voter-approved gay marriage bans overturned in December and January, respectively. In Utah, more than 1,000 same-sex couples wed before the Supreme Court issued a stay.\n\nThe 10th Circuit panel considered both cases. It did not rule on the Oklahoma ban.\n\nThough the Utah and Oklahoma cases have been closely watched, it is unclear whether they will be the first to reach the Supreme Court. The high court could choose from cases moving through five other federal appellate courts, and wouldn't consider a case until next year at the earliest.\n\nAttorneys representing Utah and Oklahoma argued voters have the right to define marriage in their states. Gay rights lawyers countered that they cannot do so in a way that deprives gay people of their fundamental rights.\n\nThe appellate ruling comes 42 years after the Supreme Court refused to hear a case of two men who were refused a marriage license in Minnesota, finding there was no legal issue for the justices to consider, and just 10 years after 11 states voted to outlaw gay marriage.\n\nNow same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Recent polls show a majority of Americans support it.",

indiana and utah are beginning to trickle in from antigay activists with the two cases representing additional defeats for an already struggling movement tony perkins of the family research council — ignoring the fact that one of the tenth circuit court judges who ruled in favor of marriage equality was recommended by sen jim inhofe and appointed by george w bush — blamed the rulings on the obama administration and leftists who have been packing the federal courts with liberal jurists in order to realize a radical social agenda perkins also said that he will represent the indignant americans who are tired of seeing the foundations of a free and just society destroyed by a handful of blackrobed tyrants while disturbing todays rulings come as no surprise given the rising disdain for the rule of law promoted by the obama administration these latest rulings are not just about redefining marriage but they are a further attempt by the courts to untether our public policies from the democratic process as well as the anthropological record while judges can by judicial fiat declare samesex marriage legal they will never be able to make it right the courts for all their power cant overturn natural law what they can do is incite a movement of indignant americans who are tired of seeing the foundations of a free and just society destroyed by a handful of blackrobed tyrants the left has long believed packing the federal courts with liberal jurists is the means of fulfilling a radical social agenda as the american people refuse to endorse that agenda at the polls or through their elected representatives as we saw with roe v wade in 1973 – despite the lefts earnest hopes the courts do not have the final say the american people will have the final word as they experience the consequences of marriage redefinition and the ways in which it fundamentally alters americas moral cultural and political landscape jeff allen an indianabased pastor and senior editor of barbwire called for elected leaders and christians to defiantly rise up and engage in civil disobedience to stop this national tragedy and the death of democracy each victory for the homosexual activists represents another nail in americas coffin he wrote adding that these decisions require that reason be jettisoned in favor of unrestrained deviancy federal courts in indiana and utah on wednesday blatantly overthrew the will of the people and subversively imposed samesex marriage on the citizens of both states the judicial oligarchy tyranny of the few continues flexing the muscle of its apparently unchecked power the death of democracy is undeniably upon us each victory for the homosexual activists represents another nail in americas coffin according to wlficom a ruling from an elitist us district judge in indiana wrongly declared that the prohibition was unconstitutional because it violated guarantees of equal protection and due process separately a rogue appeals court ruled 21 that utahs traditional marriage amendment was unconstitutional as well saying that the gender of the two persons can not be considered as a reason to deny a marriage license and thats just it — these decisions require that reason be jettisoned in favor of unrestrained deviancy the light of morality and freedom is being brutishly snuffed out right before our very eyes its a national tragedy unfolding at an accelerating pace and this is not a good harbinger of things to come — unless our elected leaders and christians defiantly rise up and engage in civil disobedience national organization for marriages brian brown unsurprisingly accused the judges of activism and sophistry todays split decision of a panel of judges in the 10th circuit is not surprising given that this circuit refused to even order a stay of the district court decision when it came down during the christmas holidays while we strongly disagree with the two judges in the majority we are encouraged by the strong defense of marriage articulated by justice paul kelly in his dissent and especially his defense of the sovereign right of the people of utah to decide this issue for themselves this principled recognition by a federal judge considering the marriage issue underscores that the people of a state are entitled to respect and deference in their desire to promote marriage as the union of one man and one woman indeed the us supreme court decided in the windsor case that the federal government must respect the right of states to define marriage the majority in the utah case engage in sophistry to attempt to argue their way around the supreme courts ruling that it is up to the states to define marriage as justice kelly noted in his dissent if the states are the laboratories of democracy requiring every state to recognize samegender unions—contrary to the views of its electorate and representatives—turns the notion of a limited national government on its head the elected representatives of the people of indiana have decided for good and proper reasons to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman it is judicial activism for a single judge to substitute his own views on marriage for the considered opinion of the peoples representatives this is just the latest example of activism from the federal bench but we fully expect this decision to eventually be reversed when the us supreme court upholds the right of states to define marriage as a man and a woman in the meantime it is imperative that the state legislature move forward a state constitutional amendment preserving marriage so that the people always remain in control of the definition of marriage in indiana",

            "body": "frc blog category states by hannah solem july 16 2014 all this talk about s1696 protecting womens rights downright deceiving if passed in the senate what has been referred to by national right to lifes president as the most radical proabortion bill ever considered by congress would undo prolife laws across the nation it is because of the carefullydrafted and rightfully enacted prolife laws that currently exist that womens health and unborn children are protected hundreds—yes hundreds—of prolife laws have been passed in states including 21 measures this year alone the very essence of this bill is destruction not protection what would be the ramifications of passing s1696 this bill would overturn these prolife and prowoman laws—laws that protect babies who are capable of feeling pain—laws that prevent sexselection abortion—laws that ensure the medical competency of health providers—laws that hold abortion clinics to the same standards of ambulatory clinics these laws are important and are being passed in states across the country s1696 is a serious unconstitutional attack on states rights last year i was on the grounds of the texas capitol when hb2 and sb1 were debated these measures have helped to protect the lives of numerous texan mothers and their unborn children it was a year ago when the lone star legislature demonstrated to the nation the truth of lt governor david dewhursts words at the end of the day life cant be stopped however s1696 seeks to end life it seeks to stop the heartbeat of the child who is being nurtured in his or her mothers womb it seeks to make profit off of the woman in crisis is this protecting no its degrading after all what is honorable about intentionally lowering medical and health standards friends this bill seeks to silence the voice of states like texas that have raised their voice for life its time to kill the bill and protect the mother and her unborn child each of us has been blessed with mothers who showed us true love and protection when they made the choice to grace us with the gift of life this bill is not about health rights its about destroying the very inalienable right that we all have been given—the right to life by frc media office june 25 2014 washington dc family research council frc president tony perkins released the following statement in response to two rulings today one being a twotoone ruling from a 10 th circuit court of appeals panel striking down utahs marriage amendment and another one from a federal judge striking down indianas defense of marriage act while disturbing todays rulings come as no surprise given the rising disdain for the rule of law promoted by the obama administration these latest rulings are not just about redefining marriage but they are a further attempt by the courts to untether our public policies from the democratic process as well as the anthropological record while judges can by judicial fiat declare samesex marriage legal they will never be able to make it right the courts for all their power cant overturn natural law what they can do is incite a movement of indignant americans who are tired of seeing the foundations of a free and just society destroyed by a handful of blackrobed tyrants the left has long believed packing the federal courts with liberal jurists is the means of fulfilling a radical social agenda as the american people refuse to endorse that agenda at the polls or through their elected representatives as we saw with roe v wade in 1973 despite the lefts earnest hopes the courts do not have the final say the american people will have the final word as they experience the consequences of marriage redefinition and the ways in which it fundamentally alters americas moral cultural and political landscape concluded perkins by frc media office february 4 2014 below are the remarks that peter sprigg frc s senior fellow for policy studies delivered before the maryland state senates judicial proceedings committee testimony in opposition to senate bill 212 peter sprigg senior fellow for policy studies family research council resident montgomery county maryland maryland state senate judicial proceedings committee february 4 2014 i urge you to oppose senate bill 212 this bill caters to anyone who is transgendered a broad umbrella term that includes transsexuals people who have had sexchange surgery anyone who has changed or is changing their public gender identity regardless of whether they have had surgery or hormone treatments transvestites people who dress as the opposite sex on an occasional basis for emotional or sexual gratification and drag queens and drag kings people who dress as the opposite sex for the purpose of entertaining others it should be opposed by anyone who believes in freedom of speech freedom of association freedom of conscience and religion and a free market economy here are some reasons why the bill would increase government interference in the free market it would substitute the judgment of the state for that of the employer regarding what qualities or characteristics are most relevant to a particular job gender identity is unlike most other characteristics protected in civil rights laws the civil rights act of 1964 bars discrimination based on race color national origin sex and religion the first four of these are included largely because they are inborn involuntary and immutable religion while voluntary is explicitly protected by the first amendment to the us constitution transgender behavior meets none of these criteria the bill would lead to costly lawsuits against employers in the case of public employers which are explicitly covered by the bill such a law could lead to large settlements being paid at taxpayers expense the bill would undermine the ability of employers to impose reasonable dress and grooming standards the bill professes to protect such standards however it requires that such standards be consistent with the employees chosen and variable gender identity this effectively forbids employers from using the most fundamental standard of all—that people be dressed and groomed in a way that is culturally appropriate for their biological sex the bill would violate the privacy of others because transgender status is not dependent on having sexchange surgery sb 212 would allow some biological males who claim to be female to appear nude before females and vice versa in bathrooms locker rooms and showers previous versions of comparable federal legislation included an exemption for shared shower and dressing facilities in which being seen unclothed is unavoidable there is no such exemption in this bill the bill would mandate the employment of transgendered individuals in inappropriate occupations for example under this bill employers in the area of education and childcare would be denied the right to refuse to hire transgendered individuals even if they consider such persons to be confusing disturbing or inappropriate role models for children and young people please vote no on senate bill 212 by anna higgins november 20 2013 this week voters in albuquerque abq voted no on a local ordinance proposal that would have banned abortions past 20 weeks gestation the age at which we know preborn children can feel pain if passed the ordinance would have protected countless women and children from the barbaric practice of lateterm abortion in what many have called the late term capitol of the united states the united states is one of only four countries in the world that permit the brutal practice for any reason this measure although defeated served an inestimably important educational function the hard work that was put into the measure was not in vain due to efforts such as these people are waking up to the fact that abortion necessarily involves two lives and that late term abortion is an unnecessary evil in fact 64 of americans support banning the practice of lateterm abortion we must build on this effort in abq and begin to introduce similar legislation in cities across the country these efforts go a long way towards exposing the truth about abortion they also force those who support the heinous practice to defend themselves in light of the reality that abortion causes excruciating pain to the preborn child and is dangerous for the mother also this week the us supreme court denied an emergency stay of the texas law that requires abortionists to obtain admitting privileges in local hospitals the denial of stay indicates that the fifth circuits refusal to enjoin the law pending a decision on the merits is not clearly erroneous thus the texas law will remain in effect until the fifth circuit has decided the case on its merits as ken klukowski noted the dissent in this decision indicated that it is likely that the court will take up this case eventually if it does this will be the first abortion case taken up by the court since 2007 meanwhile the federal unborn child pain capable protection act which handily passed the house in june was introduced in the senate by sen lindsay graham rsc the bill is expected to generate a spirited debate if permitted to come to a vote introduction of such bills and public debate is essential to a robust republic the american people deserve to know the truth about abortion and must be allowed to express their will through their representatives the will of the people was suppressed by the court in 1973 with the decision in roe v wade but recent legislative movements to restrict abortion across the country show that even 40 years later the people are still fighting for their right to be heard on the issue by rob schwarzwalder october 29 2013 a civil war general a wyoming storekeeper and a vietnamese businessman tell an extraordinary story of patriotism and opportunity john buford was a union general who held the line against the army of northern virginia on the first day of the battle of gettysburg in july 1863 he died possibly of typhoid in december of that same year abraham lincoln moved by bufords heroic service and premature loss promoted him to major general on bufords death bed in 1866 the town of buford wyoming was named after the late general over time it grew to a population of 2000 and was visited by such notables as ulysses grant and franklin roosevelt the notorious butch cassidy is reported to have robbed a store there in the 1880s the town went into gradual decline over time everyone moved away except vietnam veteran don sammons who in 1992 sold his moving business and bought buford he moved into a threebedroom log cabin a few hundred feet from the trading post and turned an old schoolhouse next door into an office he refurbished a store built in 1895 into a fourcar garage recently sammons decided to put his oneman town up for sale it was purchased not by fellow bufordites ok there are none a wyomingite or even another american it was purchased by a vietnamese businessman named nguyen dinh pham who plans to make buford the distribution center of rich vietnamese coffee throughout america about a dozen american flags fly in front of the store now named the phindeli after the sale sammons says he wanted to put vietnamese flags out in front of the store but the new owner didnt want locals to think he was trying to change this into a vietnamese town its a wyoming town and it always will be an american who fought against communists in vietnam lands in one of the most obscure places in north america and then sells his store to a vietnamese coffee merchant who insists on flying us rather than vietnamese flags in front of his store the poetic symmetry of this sequence of events is remarkable and speaks to the kind of america of which all of us can be proud it is a country where honorable people can live decent lives in peace and freedom prosper and thrive and ultimately work to achieve their own economic and personal destinies without intrusive patronizing intervention from the government when at the beginning of the war the governor of kentucky offered john buford any position in his states military he wanted buford had a ready answer i sent him word i was a captain in the united states army and i intended to remain one a patriot like that would appreciate what don sammons nguyen dinh pham and the people of rural wyoming are doing with his civic namesake by robert morrison october 4 2012 the values bus rolled into colorado this week our first stop was denver the site of last nights presidential debate yesterday we had a chance to meet with some key state legislative leaders at the centennial states impressive capitol like iowas and massachusettss and west virginias this great domed structure is covered in gold leaf i was especially pleased to renew my friendship with amy stephens years ago amy was the policy director for focus on the family when i had that role at frc now representative amy stephens is the republican leader in the state house thats a nice change wherever we go on the values bus i make it a point to meet and talk to as many local and state elected officials as i can its a most encouraging effort these are really sharp folks they are close to their constituents conscientious and capable in wisconsin minnesota iowa and virginia we had strong support for the values bus from locally elected lawmakers with the president headed into denver for his debate i had the rare opportunity of agreeing with him mr obama recently said washington is broken and we cant fix it from the inside you are so right sir and in my remarks on the steps of the state capitol i ventured the opinion that it would have been so nice if the president had realized that before his administration took control of banks insurance companies college student loans the nations health care gm and chrysler the impression one gets at these majestic solid state capitols is of people being capable of selfgovernment they built these impressive monuments to the peoples ability to run their own affairs before mr obama pressed on them a stimulus before he issued mandates and even before his epa did an environmental impact study we are rolling through the american heartland with our friends from the heritage foundation the values bus is a joint project heritages vice president for communications genevieve wood is another longtime friend she used to fill that role at frc she always generously gives frc a hat tip at each stop i return the salute saying we are honored to work with heritage foundation as they ride through the heartland dispensing subversive literature—the declaration of independence and the constitution gov mitt romney last night offered this means test for a federal program is it so critical that we are willing to borrow money from china to continue funding it so long big bird and maybe the jim lehrer news hour too although after last nights performance as the debates hesitant moderator it may be we have liberal agreement on that one whenever i visit a state capitol i am moved to ask who would think the people who built this are not capable of running their own schools sat scores are continuing their yearslong slide under president obama i dont blame him for that he doesnt take the tests but i do criticize him and even some of his republican predecessors for continuing to shovel money at the unconstitutional and wasteful federal education department can any americans point to a single improvement in their local schools we can attribute to the federal education department i should know i worked there for three years in the 1980s i served under president ronald reagan when a liberal republican congressman asked for a meeting with the president to talk about the future of the education department mr reagan wrote in the margin of the meeting agenda i hope it doesnt have one right you are mr president and as genevieve wood reminds us this is how you pile up a 16 trillion debt the state capitols are an eloquent reminder of a time when state and local governments served americans best because they were closest to the people if we lose the ability to govern ourselves in our state and local governments we can not expect wisdom suddenly to descend on the banks of the potomac as thomas jefferson said if we had to wait for washington dc to tell us when to plant we should soon want bread by christopher marlink july 29 2011 as someone whose extended family has been significantly impacted by the foster care system this story out of illinois was of interest to me personally—but the implications for the over 2000 children involved and for christians are profound the chicago tribune recently reported week that the state of illinois has acted to sever its longstanding relationship with catholic charities the state has found catholic charities and catholic social services to be in noncompliance with the states new law authorizing civil unions the trib reports in letters sent last week to catholic charities in the dioceses of peoria joliet and springfield and catholic social services of southern illinois the illinois department of children and family services said the state could not accept their signed contracts for the 2012 fiscal year each letter said funding was declined because your agency has made it clear that it does not intend to comply with the illinois religious freedom protection and civil union act which the state says requires prospective parents in civil unions to be treated the same as married couples illinois civil unions law contains exemptions for those religious bodies that do not want to perform or officiate civil unions but as weve stated elsewhere so called religious exemptions are usually just a way of greasing the skids to get controversial legislation passed the exemptions could be challenged in court or be removed by future legislation in a classic example of dont believe their talking points equality illinois published this statement about the law on their website under a section titled religious freedom prior to its passage this act would also not impact faithbased adoption agencies or adoption procedures the act does not amend the adoption act thankfully the catholic charities is not taking this lying down the three agencies in question have filed suit with the thomas moore law center against the illinois attorney general and dcfs their request is altogether reasonable in the lawsuit the agencies sought the courts permission to preserve their current policy of granting licenses to married couples and single noncohabiting individuals and referring couples in civil unions to other child welfare agencies some readers may remember that in 2006 catholic charities of boston ceased doing adoptions rather than violate their conscience and religious convictions by placing children with homosexual couples we hope and pray that catholic charities in illinois will receive a better legal outcome what is fascinating in this debate is that you have the state claiming that the law requires catholic charities give homosexual couples in civil unions equal consideration with married coupleseven though the social science data overwhelming demonstrates that children do best when raised by a married mother and father a cursory reading of the social science makes it obvious that not all family situations are equal in the benefit they provide to children see dr pat fagans work on the marri project here here and here for starters and yet the state demands that adoption and foster care agencies treat different family structures as if they were in fact the same while catholic charities works for the undeniable good of placing children in the best family situations available the state of illinois has embraced a social experiment wherein the best interests of children becomes subordinate to special interests of a vocal minority finally its important to remember why the state is involved in adoption and foster care services in the first place to serve the best interest of the children under its care not to bestow parenthood on individuals or couples desirous of the title or affirmation its about the children or at least it used to be in illinois might one legitimately ask when the state will decide that christians who disagree with normalizing homosexuality are unfit to serve as adoptive or foster parents christians across our nation have an opportunity to be the hands and feet of christ by welcoming children in need into their families our friends at focus on the family have some great resources and a model in colorado for making a difference through adoption and foster care by rob schwarzwalder april 13 2011 in 2009 barack obama appointed thenkansas gov kathleen sebelius to be secretary of health and human services this was a troubling pick for conservatives given her support for abortionondemand and support from abortion giant planned parenthood as an advocate for federal funding of abortion abortifacient drugs and embryonic stem cell research among other things sec sebelius has justified these concerns yet there is a significant bright side to sec sebelius departure from topeka former senator sam brownback a champion for life is now governor of kansas and what a difference that has made yesterday gov brownback signed legislation that strictly limits abortions after 22 weeks based on the fact that fetuses can feel pain beginning after the 21 st week of pregnancy and another measure the abortion reporting accuracy and parental rights act which requires minors who seek abortions to obtain consent from both parents and places certain prohibitions on lateterm and partial birth abortions kathleen sebelius would have fought these bills from their introduction sam brownback not only signed but celebrated them to those who say that christians should withdraw from political engagement and concentrate on private acts of charity or work solely with church or ministry groups consider sam brownback and his allies in the kansas legislature were these bills the final word in the battle for life no they are part of a larger legislative mosaic that is building gradually but steadily a culture where the personhood of the unborn child increasingly is being recognized in law and in the american conscience for the children whose lives will be saved through these measures they are nothing less than critical does political engagement bring complete resolution of every problem no but political action can make a decisive if incremental difference in a host of areas — most importantly those involving the sanctity of life the dignity of marriage and the centrality of religious liberty to american public life elections matter just ask sam brownback by brianna walden april 12 2011 maryland legislators ended their three month session yesterday april 11 th the completion of this years session brought the passage of bills that would raise the alcohol tax by three percent increase the buffer zone between picketers and funerals provide incentives for

become the 6 th state to legalize samesex marriage sb 116 which would accomplish that goal failed to pass the house of delegates and was recommitted to the house judiciary committee this victory came through the dozens of phone calls and letters from those of you who stand for traditional marriage many thanks are due to derek mccoy president of the association of maryland families and their entire staff for the tireless work that was poured into supporting this effort this victory for traditional marriage though huge is not necessarily a permanent one since the bill was recommitted to committee and not actually voted upon and failed it can be brought up again next year at its current stage in the process indeed chuck butler chairman of equality maryland the states leading lgbt advocacy organization said so we agreed that if we could not pass the bill this year we should try again next year importantly house leadership committed to bringing up the bill again in 2012 to preserve our prospects of success therefore it was best not to hold a vote now given the chances of the bills defeat by a wide margin it would be more difficult within a year to convert no votes to yes than to obtain a yes from delegates who had not locked in their position with an actual vote therefore we must remain ever vigilant on this issue because homosexual activists certainly will gender identity

            "text": "The Values Bus rolled into Colorado this week. Our first stop was Denver, the site of last night’s presidential debate. Yesterday, we had a chance to meet with some key state legislative leaders at the Centennial State’s impressive Capitol. Like Iowa’s (and Massachusetts’s and West Virginia’s) this great domed structure is covered in gold leaf.\n\nI was especially pleased to renew my friendship with Amy Stephens. Years ago, Amy was the policy director for Focus on the Family when I had that role at FRC. Now, Representative Amy Stephens is the Republican leader in the state house. That’s a nice change.\n\nWherever we go on the Values Bus, I make it a point to meet and talk to as many local and state elected officials as I can. It’s a most encouraging effort. These are really sharp folks. They are close to their constituents, conscientious, and capable. In Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and Virginia, we had strong support for the Values Bus from locally elected lawmakers.\n\nWith the president headed into Denver for his debate, I had the rare opportunity of agreeing with him. Mr. Obama recently said “Washington is broken and we can’t fix it from the inside.” You are so right, Sir! And in my remarks on the steps of the State Capitol, I ventured the opinion that it would have been so nice if the President had realized that before his administration took control of banks, insurance companies, college student loans, the nation’s health care, GM, and Chrysler.\n\nThe impression one gets at these majestic, solid state capitols is of people being capable of self-government. They built these impressive monuments to the peoples’ ability to run their own affairs before Mr. Obama pressed on them a stimulus, before he issued mandates, and even before his EPA did an environmental impact study.\n\nWe are rolling through the American heartland with our friends from the Heritage Foundation. The Values Bus is a joint project. Heritage’s Vice President for Communications, Genevieve Wood, is another long-time friend. She used to fill that role at FRC. She always generously gives FRC a hat tip at each stop. I return the salute, saying we are honored to work with Heritage Foundation as they ride through the heartland dispensing subversive literature—the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution!\n\nGov. Mitt Romney last night offered this “means test” for a federal program. Is it so critical that we are willing to borrow money from China to continue funding it? So long, Big Bird! And maybe The Jim Lehrer News Hour, too. (Although, after last night’s performance as the debate’s hesitant moderator, it may be we have liberal agreement on that one.)\n\nWhenever I visit a state capitol, I am moved to ask: “Who would think the people who built this are not capable of running their own schools?” SAT scores are continuing their years-long slide under President Obama. I don’t blame him for that. He doesn’t take the tests. But I do criticize him and even some of his Republican predecessors for continuing to shovel money at the unconstitutional and wasteful federal education department. Can any Americans point to a single improvement in their local schools we can attribute to the federal education department?\n\nI should know: I worked there for three years in the 1980s. I served under President Ronald Reagan. When a liberal Republican congressman asked for a meeting with the president to talk about the future of the Education Department. Mr. Reagan wrote in the margin of the meeting agenda: “I hope it doesn’t have one!” Right you are, Mr. President! And, as Genevieve Wood reminds us: This is how you pile up a $16 Trillion debt.\n\nThe state capitols are an eloquent reminder of a time when state and local governments served Americans best because they were closest to the people. If we lose the ability to govern ourselves in our state and local governments, we cannot expect wisdom suddenly to descend on the banks of the Potomac. As Thomas Jefferson said: “If we had to wait for Washington [D.C.] to tell us when to plant, we should soon want bread.”",

The Left has long believed packing the federal courts with liberal jurists is the means of fulfilling a radical social agenda, as the American people refuse to endorse that agenda at the polls or through their elected representatives.\n\n\"As we saw with Roe v. Wade in 1973 – despite the Left's earnest hopes, the courts do not have the final say.  The American people will have the final word as they experience the consequences of marriage redefinition and the ways in which it fundamentally alters America's moral, cultural and political landscape,\" concluded Perkins.",

            "text": "By TONY RAAP, CANDY NEAL AND HANNAH FLEACE\n\nHerald Staff Writers\n\n\n\nJASPER — Tesla Fulton was sitting at home Wednesday, idly passing time, when an online news article caught her eye. \n\n\n\nA federal judge, she read, had struck down Indiana’s ban on same-sex marriage. \n\n\n\nLater that afternoon, Fulton, 22, picked up her fiancée, 30-year-old Jamie Vest, from work and rushed to the Dubois County Courthouse to tie the knot. Around 5 p.m., the paperwork was complete.\n\n \n\nWith that, Fulton and Vest made history, becoming the county’s first same-sex couple to apply for a marriage license. The newlyweds still must go before a judge and exchange vows, which they hope to do in the next week or so. \n\n\n\n“I’m still in that euphoria,” Vest said this morning.\n\n\n\nHundreds of gay and lesbian couples flocked to courthouses across Indiana on Wednesday and this morning in a quest for marriage licenses after the state became the 20th to recognize same-sex marriage. But the state moved swiftly to halt those unions, arguing in its request for a stay that it was “premature to require Indiana to change its definition of marriage” while it appeals the ruling. \n\n\n\nLegal experts predicted U.S. District Judge Richard Young would rule within a week on the request.\n\n\n\n“That made me nervous,” Vest said  “That’s why we acted so quickly.”\n\n\n\nFulton and Vest began dating about six months ago. Both work at the Goodwill thrift store in Jasper. In fact, the couple applied for their marriage license during Vest’s dinner break. \n\n\n\n“It’s not the most romantic way,” said Vest, who usually starts her shift in the afternoon. “But it was enough time for us.”\n\n\n\nThe couple got engaged about four months ago. They had discussed traveling out of state to get married but decided to see what would happen in Indiana. \n\n\n\n“It made it even better to be able to do it here,” Fulton said.\n\n\n\n“It wasn’t a matter of showing that I love her,” Vest said. “It was a matter of the state recognizing our union officially. I’m glad that the state recognizes it now.”\n\n\n\nA lesbian couple who live in Huntingburg also applied for a marriage license Wednesday. As of this morning, no other same-sex couples in Dubois County had applied.\n\n\n\n“To be respectful of the judge and the judicial process in Indiana, we do need to follow what the judge has ordered,” Dubois County Clerk Bridgette Jarboe said. “So licenses will be issued to same-sex couples if they come into the office and request one.”\n\n\n\nAs of late this morning, 19 of the state’s 92 counties were not issuing licenses to same-sex couples, while 19 were still listed as exploring the issue. Of the group not issuing licenses were the southwest Indiana counties of Spencer, Daviess, Orange, Lawrence, Harrison and Washington. Martin and Crawford counties was among those labeled “exploring.”\n\n\n\nBut a deputy clerk in Spencer County who answered the phone this morning said her office will in fact issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples. Couples, though, will have to call ahead to schedule an appointment. Spencer County Attorney Jefferson Lindsey was the one who made the call. Clerk GayAnn Harney is on vacation.     \n\n\n\nSome counties have said they need to update forms that require a male applicant and a female applicant for a marriage license. On the forms filed Wednesday by Fulton and Vest, the spaces for the male and female applicant were replaced with hand-written words “Applicant #1” and “Applicant #2.”\n\n\n\nAt least 200 people were still in line at the Marion County clerk’s office in Indianapolis by mid-afternoon Wednesday. Many enjoyed cake as they waited to apply for their marriage licenses.\n\n\n\nAttorneys on both sides of the debate expect the issue to ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates, but many of those are being appealed.\n\n\n\nEven if their victory celebration is cut short, Indiana gay-rights supporters say Young’s ruling is an important step forward.\n\n\n\n“The reason things are changing is because we’re out, and because people are getting to know us because we’re out there and we have normal lives and normal families,” said Melody Layne, a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits challenging Indiana’s ban. Layne married her partner, Tara Betterman, in New York, and they have a daughter.\n\n\n\nIndiana law defines marriage as between a man and a woman, and the state has refused to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states where it is legal. Young’s ruling changes that and also allows same-sex couples to file joint tax returns, receive pension benefits and have their partners listed as spouses on death certificates.\n\n\n\nYoung found that Indiana’s ban on gay marriage violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution and bucked the tide of history, citing similar rulings in other federal court districts.\n\n\n\n“These couples, when gender and sexual orientation are taken away, are in all respects like the family down the street. The Constitution demands that we treat them as such,” Young wrote.\n\n\n\nThe ruling sent couples flocking to clerks’ offices across the state in a quest for marriage licenses, but not all were successful. Some counties declined to issue licenses to same-sex couples until they received guidance from the attorney general’s office.\n\n\n\nThat guidance, which came late Wednesday afternoon, instructed the five counties named in the lawsuits to comply with Young’s order or face contempt of court.

Dozens even wed as Clerk Beth White officiated beneath a white metal arch adorned in netting, artificial flowers and white holiday lights.\n\n\n\nKen Falk, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, called it an “excellent, excellent day for marriage” in Indiana. The ACLU represented several couples who challenged the ban.\n\n\n\n“Marriage is, in many ways, the most conservative institution in human society.

            "text": "Indiana is now right in the middle of the national same-sex marriage debate.\n\n\n\n U.S. District Judge Richard Young ruled the state's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional. Given recent court rulings on similar cases in other states, that was not surprising.\n\n\n\n The reaction was not surprising, either, based on what has happened in other states. In some communities, same-sex couples flocked to courthouses for marriage licenses and spur-of-the-moment weddings. \n\n\n\n In Jefferson County, one same-sex couple has filed for a marriage license.\n\n\n\n Meanwhile, the state moved swiftly to halt the new marriages. It asked for a stay of the judge's decision. Young is expected to rule on the state's request in about a week.\n\n\n\n Given the legal tangle, officials sought guidance from the Indiana Attorney General's office. And that word came down late Wednesday. The AG instructed counties to comply with Young's order or face contempt of court. \n\n\n\n As expected, there were strong reactions from people on both sides of the issue.\n\n\n\n \"These couples, when gender and sexual orientation are taken away, are in all respects like the family down the street. The Constitution demands that we treat them as such,\" Young wrote in his ruling.\n\n\n\n \"The reason things are changing is because we're out, and because people are getting to know us because we're out there and we have normal lives and normal families,\" Melody Layne, a plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging Indiana's ban, told The Associated Press. Layne married her partner, Tara Betterman, in New York, and they have a daughter.\n\n\n\n On the other side are those who stand firm for a traditional view of marriage - one man and one woman, as the state has defined it.\n\n\n\n \"Regardless of what any judge say s, marriage is about uniting men and women together for the best interests of children and society,\" American Family Association of Indiana Executive Director Micah Clark said in a statement. \"Men and women are uniquely and individually important. They are not interchangeable or discardable.\"\n\n\n\n The road is obviously leading to where many believe it should: the U.S. Supreme Court. Last year, the Supreme Court struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates. Many of those decisions are being appealed.\n\n\n\n Americans have strong, and split, opinions about the morality or immorality of same-sex marriages. We do not expect any court ruling to change people's minds in that regard. But legal clarity will have to be provided by the nation's highest court.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n Please feel free to submit your comments.\n\n\n\nArticle comments are not posted immediately to the Web site.

            "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. - Family Research Council (FRC) President Tony Perkins released the following statement in response to two rulings today - one being a two-to-one ruling from a 10th Circuit Court of Appeals panel striking down Utah's marriage amendment and another one from a federal judge striking down Indiana's Defense of Marriage Act:\n\n\"While disturbing, today's rulings come as no surprise given the rising disdain for the rule of law promoted by the Obama administration.  These latest rulings are not just about redefining marriage but they are a further attempt by the courts to untether our public policies from the democratic process, as well as the anthropological record.\n\n\"While judges can, by judicial fiat, declare same-sex 'marriage' legal, they will never be able to make it right.  The courts, for all their power, can't overturn natural law.  What they can do is incite a movement of indignant Americans, who are tired of seeing the foundations of a free and just society destroyed by a handful of black-robed tyrants. The Left has long believed packing the federal courts with liberal jurists is the means of fulfilling a radical social agenda, as the American people refuse to endorse that agenda at the polls or through their elected representatives.\n\n\"As we saw with Roe v. Wade in 1973 - despite the Left's earnest hopes, the courts do not have the final say.  The American people will have the final word as they experience the consequences of marriage redefinition and the ways in which it fundamentally alters America's moral, cultural and political landscape,\" concluded Perkins.",

Three judges from the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments from both sides of the case that seeks to determine whether Virginia's same sex marriage ban is constitutional. (Photo : Zach Gibson/Getty Images)\n\nA U.S. appeals court Wednesday struck down a state ban on same-sex marriage citing the Constitution's protection of same-sex couples, giving gay-marriage advocates another strategic victory toward a ruling in the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nIn Utah, the panel of judges ruled 2-1 against the gay marriage ban and argued that all couples, regardless of sexual orientation, have the constitutional right to wed, CNN reported.\n\n\n\n\"We hold that the 14th Amendment protects the fundamental right to marry, establish a family, raise children and enjoy the full protection of a state's marital laws,\" the judge said in the majority opinion.\n\n\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals added that they don't want to identify individuals who oppose same-sex marriage as intolerant but insisted the practice of banning the marriage is unreasonable, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\n\n\"It is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples,\" the judges wrote.\n\n\n\nThe decision in Utah adds another tally in the win column for gay rights advocates as lower courts in the U.S. continue to rule against same-sex marriage bans. Since the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of the Marriage Act last year, 16 federal judges have ruled in favor allowing gay marriages, according to The AP.\n\n\n\nOn the same day, a federal judge in Indiana also struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage, which is likely to be taken to an appeals court, according to CNN.\n\n\n\nUtah and Indiana could potentially join the 19 states as well as the District of Colombia that have already legalized same-sex marriage. In 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to make it legal.\n\n\n\nAccording to a Williams Institute survey, the Salt Lake City metropolitan area was home to the highest rate of same-sex couples raising children in the nation at 27 percent. Memphis, Virginia Beach, Detroit and San Antonio were close behind, while Mississippi was the state with the highest rate of gay parents at 26 percent.\n\n\n\nWhen Utah's Prop 3 -- a resolution to ban gay marriage -- was passed in 2004, it had 66 percent voter support, but since then, voter support for a gay marriage ban in the state has dropped to about 50 percent, CNN reported.",

            "text": "DENVER (AP) — A federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled for the first time that states must allow gay couples to marry, finding the Constitution protects same-sex relationships and putting a remarkable legal winning streak across the country one step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe decision from a three-judge panel in Denver upheld a lower court ruling that struck down Utah’s gay marriage ban. The panel immediately put on the ruling on hold so it could be appealed, either to the entire 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals or directly to the nation’s highest court.\n\n“A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union,” the panel wrote. Gay marriage in Utah likely will remain on hold pending the appeal.\n\nThe decision gives increased momentum to a legal cause that already compiled an impressive winning streak in the lower courts after the Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 14 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates.\n\nTwo of the most striking of those decisions were in the conservative states of Utah and Oklahoma, which saw their voter-approved gay marriage bans overturned in December and January, respectively. In Utah, more than 1,000 same-sex couples wed before the Supreme Court issued a stay.\n\nThe 10th Circuit panel considered both cases. It did not rule on the Oklahoma ban.\n\nThough the Utah and Oklahoma cases were closely watched, it is unclear whether they will be the first to reach the Supreme Court. The high court could choose from cases moving through five other federal appellate courts, and wouldn’t consider a case until next year at the earliest.\n\nAttorneys representing Utah and Oklahoma argued voters have the right to define marriage in their states. Gay rights lawyers countered that they cannot do so in a way that deprives gay people of their fundamental rights.\n\nThe appellate ruling comes 42 years after the Supreme Court refused to hear a case of two men who were refused a marriage license in Minnesota, finding there was no legal issue for the justices to consider, and just 10 years after 11 states voted to outlaw gay marriage.\n\nNow same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Recent polls show a majority of Americans support it.",

            "text": "DENVER (AP) — A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that states must allow gay couples to marry, finding the Constitution protects same-sex relationships and putting a remarkable legal winning streak across the country one step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe three-judge panel in Denver ruled 2-1 that states cannot deprive people of the fundamental right to marry simply because they want to be wedded to someone of the same sex.\n\nThe judges added they don't want to brand as intolerant those who oppose gay marriage, but said there is no reasonable objection to the practice.\n\n\"It is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples,\" they wrote, addressing arguments that the ruling could undermine traditional marriage.\n\nThe decision by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld a lower court ruling that struck down Utah's gay marriage ban. However, the panel immediately put Wednesday's ruling on hold so it could be appealed, either to the entire 10th Circuit or directly to the nation's highest court.\n\n\"All I can say is that we are thrilled,\" said Kody Partridge, one of the Utah plaintiffs. She was working in the garden with her wife, Laurie Wood, when they heard about the ruling.\n\n\"This is such as historic thing, not just for Utah but for Laurie and me\" and plaintiffs across the country, Partridge said. \"This is a big day.\"\n\nThe decision gives increased momentum to a legal cause that already compiled an impressive winning streak in the lower courts after the Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates.\n\nThe latest of those rulings was in Indiana, where a federal judge on Wednesday struck down that state's same-sex marriage ban in a ruling that immediately allows gay couples to wed.\n\nTwo of the most striking lower court rulings were in the conservative states of Utah and Oklahoma, which saw their voter-approved gay marriage bans overturned in December and January, respectively. In Utah, more than 1,000 same-sex couples wed before the Supreme Court issued a stay.\n\nThe 10th Circuit panel considered both cases. It did not rule on the Oklahoma ban.\n\nSharon Baldwin, one of the plaintiffs in the Oklahoma case, said moments after the Utah ruling that she felt positive because the two cases are so similar.\n\n\"We're thrilled for the plaintiffs in Utah,\" she said. \"We think this is wonderful news, and we're excited to see our ruling coming soon.\"\n\nGay marriage opponents, meanwhile, have vowed to continue their fight. Along with the Catholic Church, several other major denominations remain adamant in opposing same-sex marriage.\n\n\"While judges can, by judicial fiat, declare same-sex 'marriage' legal, they will never be able to make it right,\" Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said in a statement. \"The courts, for all their power, can't overturn natural law.\"\n\nIn his dissent Wednesday, 10th Circuit Justice Paul J. Kelly Jr. said the court was overstepping its authority and that states should be able to decide who can marry.\n\n\"We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of the Fourteenth Amendment,\" he wrote.\n\nThough the Utah and Oklahoma cases have been closely watched, it is unclear whether they will be the first to reach the Supreme Court. The high court could choose from cases moving through five other federal appellate courts, and wouldn't consider a case until next year at the earliest.\n\nAttorneys representing Utah and Oklahoma argued voters have the right to define marriage in their states. Gay rights lawyers countered that they cannot do so in a way that deprives gay people of their fundamental rights.\n\nThe appellate ruling comes 42 years after the Supreme Court refused to hear a case of two men who were refused a marriage license in Minnesota, finding there was no legal issue for the justices to consider, and just 10 years after 11 states voted to outlaw gay marriage.\n\nNow same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Recent polls show a majority of Americans support it.\n\nRuling from 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/13/13-4178.pdf\n\nAssociated Press writer Kristi Eaton in Oklahoma City contributed to this report.",

            "text": "Gay marriage advocates won a significant court victory Wednesday when a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling in Utah that struck down the state’s ban on same-sex marriages.\n\nThe 2-1 ruling by a panel of the Denver-based 10th Circuit Court of Appeals marks the first time a federal appellate court has upheld same-sex marriage. One year ago, on June 26, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down portions of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, a landmark ruling that extended federal benefits to gays — though the high court stopped short of ruling that same-sex marriage was a constitutionally protected right.\n\nThe Utah decision comes after a string of more than a dozen victories for advocates of gay marriage, including one in Indiana on Wednesday. The Utah ruling was stayed, meaning that gay marriages won’t take place while the case is on appeal. But the ruling carries importance because it occurred in a conservative state. Though not binding on other federal appellate courts, the decision is likely to be a factor in future decisions elsewhere, experts said.\n\n“This is a victory for humanity!” a grinning Kate Call, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said at a news conference in Salt Lake City. Another plaintiff, Derek Kitchen, said, “I don’t think Utah can deny same-sex couples their right [to marry] for much longer.”\n\n“This is the most significant victory in the history of the gay rights movement,” said Clifford Rosky, a law professor at the University of Utah, who has closely followed the issue and is board chairman of Equality Utah, a gay rights group. “A federal appeals court has recognized that same-sex couples enjoy the same freedoms as all Americans — the freedoms to marry, establish a family and raise children together. This is a victory not only for the 1,300 same-sex couples who are married in Utah, but for all gay Americans.”\n\nUtah will continue the fight to uphold its ban on same-sex marriages all the way to the Supreme Court, state officials said hours after the ruling was released.\n\n“I’m disappointed because I believe states do have a right, through the democratic process, to define marriage,” Gov. Gary R. Herbert said at a news conference. However, he added that the ruling was good news because it took the issue a step closer to being resolved by the Supreme Court, which would “bring some finality to this, which is what all people, on all sides of the issue should want — which is what I want.”\n\nTechnically, the state can appeal to the full appeals court, then, if needed, seek permission to argue before the Supreme Court. Given the flurry of rulings around the country and pending cases on appeal from Oklahoma and Virginia, most people expect the Supreme Court will choose to weigh in.\n\nThe 10th Circuit majority was forceful in backing the right for all to marry, regardless of sexual preference.\n\n“We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right to marry, establish a family, raise children and enjoy the full protection of a state’s marital laws,” the majority wrote in its decision, posted on the court's website. “A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union.\n\n“For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm.”\n\nIn his dissent, Judge Paul J. Kelly Jr. warned that the court was overstepping its authority and that states should be able to decide who can marry. “We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of the Fourteenth Amendment,” he wrote.\n\nBrian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage, backed the dissenting judge.\n\n“While we strongly disagree with the two judges in the majority, we are encouraged by the strong defense of marriage articulated by Justice Paul Kelly in his dissent, and especially his defense of the sovereign right of the people of Utah to decide this issue for themselves,” Brown said.\n\nA similar case in Oklahoma is pending before the 10th Circuit. A Virginia case that struck down that state’s ban has been argued on appeal and a decision is pending.\n\nUtah, one of the most conservative states on the issue of gay rights, found itself in the fray over same-sex marriage when U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby struck down its ban on such unions on Dec. 20. State officials sought to stay the ruling, but the 10th Circuit Court rejected that effort on Dec. 22. The Supreme Court ordered a stay on Jan. 6, but the delay was long enough to allow more than 1,000 same-sex couples to marry.\n\nSince the Defense of Marriage Act ruling, federal judges have been unanimous in upholding the right of gays to marry and have struck down bans on the practice, saying they violate the equal-protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. Lower court judges have also frequently cited the Supreme Court’s 1967 decision to strike down state laws barring marriage between races in a Virginia case.\n\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia have legalized gay marriage. Lawsuits have been filed in every other state to legalize gay marriage and related issues.\n\n“The 10th Circuit opinion is very important as the first appeals court to affirm invalidation of a state same-sex ban,” said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law in Virginia. The opinion is comprehensive and is likely to influence other appeals courts.\n\nMeanwhile, same-sex marriages began in Indiana on Wednesday after a federal judge struck down the state’s ban on them, saying it violated the U.S. Constitution's equal-protection clause. U.S. District Judge Richard Young's ruling did not have a stay on it and couples began marrying immediately.\n\nThe Indiana attorney general's office said it would ask for a stay while it appealed the ruling to a higher court.\n\nTimes staff writer Javier Panzer and Matt Pearce contributed to this report.",

            "text": "In the first federal appellate level consideration of same-sex marriage since the Supreme Court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act last year, the 10th Circuit has agreed with the lower court that Utah’s ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. In a 2-1 decision, the panel ruled that the Constitution guarantees that “those who wish to marry a person of the same sex are entitled to exercise the same fundamental right as it is recognized by persons who wish to marry a person of the opposite sex.”\n\nThe ruling was immediately stayed, recognizing that the Supreme Court had stayed the district court’s original ruling earlier this year.\n\nThe majority of the panel rejected the state’s arguments that marriage must be linked to procreation: “Appellants’ assertion that the right to marry is fundamental because it is linked to procreation is further undermined by the fact that individuals have a fundamental right to choose against reproduction.” They were also not persuaded by claims that the inherent definition of marriage demanded unions between a man and a woman, because “nothing logically or physically precludes same-sex couples from marrying, as is amply demonstrated by the fact that many states now permit such marriages.”\n\n“Plaintiffs in this case have convinced us that Amendment 3 violates their fundamental right to marry and to have their marriages recognized,” they wrote. “We may not deny them relief based on a mere preference that their arguments be settled elsewhere. Nor may we defer to majority will in dealing with matters so central to personal autonomy. The protection and exercise of fundamental rights are not matters for opinion polls or the ballot box.”\n\nIn his dissent, Judge Paul Joseph Kelly, Jr., a George H. W. Bush appointee, argued that the Supreme Court’s rulings in Windsor and past gay rights rulings “simply have not created a fundamental right to same-gender marriage.” He found plausibility in the state’s rationales for banning same-sex marriage, including “(1) encouraging responsible procreation given the unique ability of opposite-gender couples to conceive, (2) effective parenting to benefit the offspring, and (3) proceeding with caution insofar as altering and expanding the definition of marriage.” Because same-sex couples cannot biologically procreate, the state has a rational reason for treating them differently.\n\nEven though same-sex couples may have children, Kelly reasoned, “far more opposite-gender couples will produce and care for children” and “perpetuation of the species depends upon procreation.” Thus, “consistent with the greatest good for the greatest number,” the state can choose to believe that opposite-gender parents are better and incentivize that outcome. He was not convinced there was sufficient evidence to suggest otherwise, and “we should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of constitutional interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.”",

            "text": "\"It is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples,\" a three-judge panel in the Utah case said while upholding a lower court ruling, NPR reported.\n\nBack in December, Utah briefly became the 18th state where gay couples received the right to marry, after a federal district judge ruled that the state's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. The decision was then put on hold pending appeals, though more than 1,300 gay and lesbian couples managed to get married before that.\n\nWednesday's decision, which resulted from a 2-1 split decision, has been put on hold, pending appeal which could go directly to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Indiana, District Judge Richard Young, who also upheld a lower court ruling, added: \"Same-sex couples, who would otherwise qualify to marry in Indiana, have the right to marry in Indiana. ... These couples, when gender and sexual orientation are taken away, are in all respects like the family down the street. The Constitution demands that we treat them as such.\"\n\nIndiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller has filed a notice of appeal and an emergency request for a stay of Young's order, The Courier-Journal reported.\n\n\"Until the United States Supreme Court determines that traditional marriage laws such as Indiana's are unconstitutional, it is premature to require Indiana to change its definition of marriage and abide by this court's conception of marriage,\" the attorney general wrote in the request for stay. \"Nonetheless, marriages in violation of Indiana's existing law have taken place, are taking place, and will continue to take place pursuant to this court's order.\"\n\nTraditional marriage groups, such as the National Organization for Marriage, which last week staged the March for Marriage event in Washington D.C., said that they disagree with the decisions but do not find it surprising.\n\n\"The elected representatives of the people of Indiana have decided, for good and proper reasons, to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. It is judicial activism for a single judge to substitute his own views on marriage for the considered opinion of the people's representatives,\" NOM President Brian Brown said in a statement.\n\n\"This is just the latest example of activism from the federal bench, but we fully expect this decision to eventually be reversed when the U.S. Supreme Court upholds the right of states to define marriage as a man and a woman. In the meantime, it is imperative that the state legislature move forward a state constitutional amendment preserving marriage so that the people always remain in control of the definition of marriage in Indiana.\"\n\nBrown also praised Justice Paul Kelly's dissent in the Kitchen v. Herbert case in Utah, where the judge argued that the people of the state have the right to decide the issue for themselves.\n\n\"And while the Court has recognized a fundamental right to marriage, every decision vindicating that right has involved two persons of the opposite gender. Indeed, the Court has been less than solicitious of plural marriages or polygamy,\" Kelly wrote.\n\n\"If the States are the laboratories of democracy, requiring every state to recognize same-gender unions—contrary to the views of its electorate and representatives—turns the notion of a limited national government on its head.\"\n\nEarlier in June, Wisconsin also saw it's same-sex marriage ban declared unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb neither stayed the ruling nor clarified when it takes effect, however, making it unclear whether gay licenses could be immediately issued.",

            "text": "Today’s Supreme Court opinions have a lot of interesting food for thought in them. But I just thought I’d point out that meanwhile, this morning the Tenth Circuit struck down Utah’s ban on same-sex marriage. Judge Lucero wrote the majority opinion, joined by Judge Holmes. It begins:\n\nOur commitment as Americans to the principles of liberty, due process of law, and equal protection of the laws is made live by our adherence to the Constitution of the United States of America. Historical challenges to these principles ultimately culminated in the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment nearly one-and-a-half centuries ago. This Amendment extends the guarantees of due process and equal protection to every person in every State of the Union. Those very principles are at issue yet again in this marriage equality appeal.\n\nJudge Kelly dissented. Unless I have missed one, I believe he is the first federal judge to vote against a constitutional same-sex marriage claim since the Supreme Court’s decision in Windsor a year ago. His dissent ends:\n\nI assume that Utah will seek rehearing en banc, but if it is denied relatively quickly, the Supreme Court will be able to decide by next fall whether to hear the case. If it did decide to hear the case, it would be able to decided it by this time next year.",

            "text": "Plaintiff Derek Kitchen (right) said he and his partner, Moudi Sbeity, were proud to be a part of history. DENVER — A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that states must allow gay couples to marry. The court ruled that the Constitution protected same-sex relationships and put a remarkable legal winning streak across the country one step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court. The three-judge panel in Denver ruled 2-1 that states cannot deprive people of the fundamental right to marry simply because they want to be wedded to someone of the same sex. The judges on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel addressed arguments that the ruling could undermine traditional marriage. \"It is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples,\" the judges wrote. The decision upheld a lower court ruling that struck down Utah's gay marriage ban. It becomes law in the six states covered by the 10th Circuit: Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. But the panel immediately put the ruling on hold pending an appeal. The three-judge panel in Denver ruled 2-1 that states cannot deprive people of the fundamental right to marry in the USA. The Utah attorney general's office will appeal the decision but is still assessing whether it will go directly to the U.S. Supreme Court or ask the entire 10th Circuit to review the ruling, spokeswoman Missy Larsen said. \"Although the Court's 2-1 split decision does not favor the State, we are pleased that the ruling has been issued and takes us one step closer to reaching certainty and finality for all Utahans on such an important issue with a decision from the highest court,\" the office said in a statement. Wednesday afternoon, the couples named in the appeal hugged, cried and exchanged kisses at a news conference outside their attorney's offices in downtown Salt Lake City. \"This decision is an absolute victory for fairness and equality for all families in Utah, in every state in the 10th Circuit and every state in this great nation of the United States,\" said their attorney, Peggy Tomsic. Plaintiff Derek Kitchen said he and his partner, Moudi Sbeity, are \"so proud to be a part of history.\" \"It feels wonderful to be among one of the many same-sex couples across the country that are being respected and are offered dignity by the court system, and this is just emblematic of the United States judicial process,\" Kitchen said. \"I don't think that the state of Utah can continue to deny same-sex couples their rights for much longer.\" The decision gives increased momentum to a legal cause that already has compiled an impressive record in the lower courts after the Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates. The latest of those rulings came Wednesday in Indiana, where a federal judge struck down the state's same-sex marriage ban in a decision that immediately allows gay couples to wed.

            "text": "DENVER — A federal appeals court on Friday ruled that Oklahoma must allow gay couples to wed, marking the second time it has found the U.S. Constitution protects same-sex marriage.\n\nThe decision from a three-judge panel in Denver upholds rulings that struck down Oklahoma’s gay marriage ban.\n\nThe 2-1 ruling comes after the same panel ruled June 25 that Utah’s ban on same-sex marriage violates the Constitution. It was the first time an appellate court determined that last year’s U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act means states cannot deny gays the ability to wed.\n\nThe panel put its Oklahoma and Utah rulings on hold pending an appeal. Utah’s attorney general has said he plans to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\n“We expect (Oklahoma) to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court,” said Marc Solomon, the executive director of the Freedom to Marry campaign. But that might not happen until the end of the year.\n\n“Then the Supreme Court could take up this case, they could take up the Utah case, or they could do nothing,” he said.\n\nSolomon said the high court would have until the end of the year to decide whether or not to hear the appeals.\n\n“If they don’t take up any marriage case then the ruling would go into effect and the couples would marry throughout the 10th Circuit,” he said.\n\nThe ruling, the 26th ruling this year striking down gay marriage bans, drew praise from the Tulsa couple at the center of the Oklahoma case.\n\n“We are gratified that the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has affirmed the January ruling of U.S. District Judge Terence Kern that all people are equal under the law,” plaintiffs Mary Bishop and Sharon Baldwin said. “We are so grateful that the 10th Circuit understands what more and more people across this country are beginning to realize: that gay and lesbian people are citizens who should enjoy the same rights as straight people under the law.”\n\nBoth Baldwin and Bishop said they looked forward to seeing Oklahoma recognize the marriages of gay and lesbian couples.\n\nAn attorney for Tulsa County’s clerk says he disagrees with the ruling. Byron Babione with the nonprofit Alliance Defending Freedom said Friday that the people of Oklahoma confirmed their belief that every child deserves a mom and a dad when they approved a constitutional amendment affirming marriage as a man-woman union.\n\nThe organization represents Tulsa County Clerk Sally Howe Smith, who was sued when she refused to grant a marriage license to a same-sex couple. Babione says he’s consulting with Smith and considering whether to appeal Friday’s decision by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe decisions give increased momentum to a legal cause that has compiled an impressive string of lower court victories. More than 20 courts have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates since the Supreme Court’s DOMA ruling in June 2013. The rulings have come in 17 states, with Florida being the latest.\n\nUtah and Oklahoma saw their voter-approved gay marriage bans struck down in December and January, respectively. In Utah, more than 1,000 same-sex couples married before the Supreme Court issued a stay.\n\nThe high court also could choose from five other federal appellate courts, and it won’t consider a case until next year at the earliest.\n\nAttorneys representing Utah and Oklahoma argued that voters have the right to define marriage in their states, and unions between a man and woman are best for children.\n\nGay rights lawyers countered that voters cannot define marriage in a way that deprives gay people of their fundamental rights, and say there is no proof that gay couples make inferior parents.\n\nTen years ago, nearly a dozen states outlawed gay marriage. Now same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia, and recent polls show a majority of Americans support it.\n\nGay rights groups are planning celebrations across the state following the ruling.\n\nTwo separate rallies were planned Friday evening in Oklahoma City, with other events scheduled in Tulsa and Norman.\n\nA “Decision Day Gathering” set for 7 p.m. Friday night at the Mayflower Congregational Church in northwest Oklahoma City was expected to draw hundreds of people.\n\nOne of the event’s organizers, Troy Stevenson of The Equality Network, said there is a tremendous sense of relief for members of Oklahoma’s gay and lesbian community, but he also noted the case ultimately must be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.",

            "text": "Utah and Indiana became the latest U.S. states to see their bans on same-sex marriage struck down following separate rulings in federal court on Wednesday.\n\n“It is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples,” a three-judge panel in the Utah case said while upholding a lower court ruling, NPR reported.\n\nBack in December, Utah briefly became the 18th state where gay couples received the right to marry, after a federal district judge ruled that the state’s same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. The decision was then put on hold pending appeals, though more than 1,300 gay and lesbian couples managed to get married before that.\n\nWednesday’s decision, which resulted from a 2-1 split decision, has been put on hold, pending appeal which could go directly to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Indiana, District Judge Richard Young, who also upheld a lower court ruling, added: “Same-sex couples, who would otherwise qualify to marry in Indiana, have the right to marry in Indiana. … These couples, when gender and sexual orientation are taken away, are in all respects like the family down the street. The Constitution demands that we treat them as such.”\n\nIndiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller has filed a notice of appeal and an emergency request for a stay of Young’s order, The Courier-Journal reported.\n\n“Until the United States Supreme Court determines that traditional marriage laws such as Indiana’s are unconstitutional, it is premature to require Indiana to change its definition of marriage and abide by this court’s conception of marriage,” the attorney general wrote in the request for stay. “Nonetheless, marriages in violation of Indiana’s existing law have taken place, are taking place, and will continue to take place pursuant to this court’s order.”\n\nTraditional marriage groups, such as the National Organization for Marriage, which last week staged the March for Marriage event in Washington D.C., said that they disagree with the decisions but do not find it surprising.\n\n“The elected representatives of the people of Indiana have decided, for good and proper reasons, to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman. It is judicial activism for a single judge to substitute his own views on marriage for the considered opinion of the people’s representatives,” NOM President Brian Brown said in a statement.\n\n“This is just the latest example of activism from the federal bench, but we fully expect this decision to eventually be reversed when the U.S. Supreme Court upholds the right of states to define marriage as a man and a woman. In the meantime, it is imperative that the state legislature move forward a state constitutional amendment preserving marriage so that the people always remain in control of the definition of marriage in Indiana.”\n\nBrown also praised Justice Paul Kelly’s dissent in the Kitchen v. Herbert case in Utah, where the judge argued that the people of the state have the right to decide the issue for themselves.\n\n“And while the Court has recognized a fundamental right to marriage, every decision vindicating that right has involved two persons of the opposite gender. Indeed, the Court has been less than solicitious of plural marriages or polygamy,” Kelly wrote.\n\n“If the States are the laboratories of democracy, requiring every state to recognize same-gender unions—contrary to the views of its electorate and representatives—turns the notion of a limited national government on its head.”\n\nEarlier in June, Wisconsin also saw it’s same-sex marriage ban declared unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb neither stayed the ruling nor clarified when it takes effect, however, making it unclear whether gay licenses could be immediately issued.",

            "text": "« Go back a post || Return to G-A-Y homepage || Haul tail to next post »\n\nThe last four states to vote on marriage equality all passed it, and the last few legislatures to consider the matter ultimately put it through. Every credible poll shows Americans supporting equality; even less credible polls show an even or above-even split.\n\nCulturally, marriage equality is a non-event. One of TV's biggest comedies, Modern Family, just ended its season with a big same-sex wedding. There wasn't even a hint of controversy. There never is anymore. Americans know that marriage equality is here—and most people like that.\n\nBut no, no. The American people just aren't into it, insists the Family Research Council, who apparently wrote this on a Tandy computer in 1986:\n\n\" While judges can, by judicial fiat, declare same-sex 'marriage' legal, they will never be able to make it right. The courts, for all their power, can't overturn natural law. What they can do is incite a movement of indignant Americans, who are tired of seeing the foundations of a free and just society destroyed by a handful of black-robed tyrants. The Left has long believed packing the federal courts with liberal jurists is the means of fulfilling a radical social agenda, as the American people refuse to endorse that agenda at the polls or through their elected representatives....As we saw with Roe v. Wade in 1973 - despite the Left's earnest hopes, the courts do not have the final say. The American people will have the final word as they experience the consequences of marriage redefinition and the ways in which it fundamentally alters America's moral, cultural and political landscape \" [statement emailed to G-A-Y]\n\nYeah, yeah, Tony. You want this to be the new Roe. That's because you and your pals want to keep this gravy train going, both personally and politically, for the next few decades. We all get what's going on there. And it's not going to work. These issues are not the liberal twin pops that you all want them to be.\n\nBut that's not even my big bugaboo here. I seriously want to know, Tony, how those of you who operate in a movement that is so glaringly waning and so reliably losing on EVERY SINGLE FRONT can seriously sit there with anything resembling a straight face and claim that you have the American public in your corner. It's just a lie. Yes, we are seeing great victories in the courts because the courts are where civil rights matters have historically wound up. But we're seeing great victories EVERYWHERE. I mean at this point, the anti-equality movement can't even convince Republican governors to appeal pro-equality rulings (Christie, Corbett, Martinez) or sign anti-gay laws (Brewer). Multiple Republican U.S. Senators have come out and admitted that marriage equality is the way of the future. Even in deep red states like Utah, the news of an overturned marriage ban barely sparks a flicker of protest, much less a wave. That's because the American public is moving toward the expansion of equality, Tony, and not the expansion of discrimination.\n\nKeep trying to change the tide, if you must. One must dedicate his or her life to goals, be they constructive or destructive. But stop kidding yourself of the public, Tony. The American people are not with your movement—not anymore. Some (self included) would say that your ever-deceptive movement has only helped increase that rapid change.",

hundreds of years of legal precedent and imposing samesex marriage on the states by judicial fiat i have to be honest with you when i look at each one of these cases i see an activist judge kowtowing to the homosexual lobby ignoring precedent and overstepping the bounds of what theyre supposed to do schmid told wnd he cited the example of baker v nelson a 1971 case in which the minnesota supreme court ruled the states limitation of marriage to a man and a woman did not violate the us constitution the case was appealed to the us supreme court which dismissed it for want of a substantial federal question baker versus nelson had been binding precedent for a long time and now you have federal judges ignoring that and saying weve had significant doctrinal developments when only the us

opposite sex schmid said and for good reason the state has always had a compelling interest in fostering procreation the 10th circuit court today ignored that they walked right past that schmid said

The Constitution demands that we treat them as such.”\n\nAlso on Wednesday, a three-judge panel on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver ruled in a 2-1 decision that Utah can no longer deny a marriage license to a couple based solely on their genders. The same court is also considering the ban in Oklahoma but did not rule on that case Wednesday.\n\nWith the two rulings Wednesday, same-sex marriage is legal in 20 states plus the District of Columbia. Thirteen states have had their marriage laws overturned by a federal court, and in many cases, such as in Indiana, a single judge made the decision.\n\nWednesday’s rulings came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the Supreme Court’s 5-4 ruling that struck down California’s voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. The judge in the forerunner to that case, Vaughn Walker, later admitted he was homosexual, which opponents argued was a conflict of interest.\n\nDaniel Schmid, litigation counsel for the pro-family non-profit legal advocacy group Liberty Counsel, said activist judges are erasing hundreds of years of legal precedent and imposing same-sex marriage on the states by judicial fiat.\n\n“I have to be honest with you. When I look at each one of these cases I see an activist judge kowtowing to the homosexual lobby, ignoring precedent and overstepping the bounds of what they’re supposed to do,” Schmid told WND.\n\nHe cited the example of Baker v.

us to have oppositesex marriages said mott a transgender woman if the supreme court upholds the decision it wouldnt force religious groups to conduct gay marriages on their premises irigonegaray said but it does prevent them in conjunction with government from denying couples that constitutional right the denial to samesex couples of equality in marriage has been largely driven by what are

            "text": "Note: Your phone must support HTML5 video or Flash to play videos.\n\nFor the eight years she has lived in Topeka, Shaun Kelly has been holding her breath.\n\nBut Wednesday, she let a little go: A federal appellate court that covers Kansas ruled states can’t ban same-sex marriages.\n\n“This is the first time a federal appeals court has ruled for same-sex marriage,” she said, excitement in her voice. “My phone has been ringing, blowing up — everyone is so pumped. I would love to see this continue.”\n\nKelly, 50, has agonized, watching with bated breath as her city oscillates between denying and extending equal rights to the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. She has feared to exhale as others in her community hide who they are over fear of losing their jobs.\n\nBut Wednesday’s decision brings the ban one step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court — and a final decision on the issue.\n\n“If the Supreme Court upholds this decision, the stain on our Kansas Constitution denying equal protection to marriage for our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters would no longer be valid,” said Topeka lawyer Pedro Irigonegaray.\n\nBut that won’t be true just for Kansas, or even just the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, he said.\n\n“If the U.S. Supreme Court finds it to be a correct decision, it becomes law of the land,” Irigonegaray said.\n\nPut another way: “If they hadn’t stayed the opinion, we could have potentially seen marriage licenses being issued to same-sex couples in Kansas today,” said Tom Witt, executive director of Equality Kansas.\n\nCongressman Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., in an emailed statement said the 2-1 panel decision — a decision of “two radical judges” — overruled the opinions of nearly 3 million American voters and their elected representatives and harmed marriages, families and children in supporting same-sex marriage.\n\n“As the author of the Kansas Marriage Protection Amendment, I am incensed that two lawyers in Denver, Colorado, believe they can overrule 70 percent of Kansas, plus strong majorities in Utah and Colorado,” he said.\n\nThe three-judge panel on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled states must allow gay couples to marry, citing the equal protections granted under the Fourteenth Amendment. The panel put an immediate stay on the decision in anticipation of an appeal, which the Utah attorney general’s office already is working on. From there, it could go to all the 10th U.S. Circuit judges or, more likely, to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nEither way, proponents say, Wednesday’s decision is monumental: The federal appeals court is the highest court to overturn the state ban on same-sex marriages.\n\n“It’s another step down the road,” Witt said.\n\nA year ago Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act that allowed the federal government to deny benefits to same-sex couples. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates, The Associated Press reported.\n\n“A year from today,” Witt said, “I think we’ll probably be celebrating the final Supreme Court decision.”\n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals includes Utah, Kansas, Wyoming, Colorado, Oklahoma and New Mexico.\n\nAmong those, only New Mexico allows same-sex couples to marry. As of Wednesday, 19 states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriages, according to www.FreedomToMarry.org.\n\nLifting the ban on same-sex marriage also would benefit the transgender community, said Stephanie Mott, executive director of the Kansas Statewide Education Project. The state of Kansas sees transgender people only as their birth sex, she explained.\n\n“For many of us, those who are attracted to members of the opposite gender, striking down the Kansas marriage discrimination law and constitutional amendment would actually allow us to have opposite-sex marriages,” said Mott, a transgender woman.\n\nIf the Supreme Court upholds the decision, it wouldn’t force religious groups to conduct gay marriages on their premises, Irigonegaray said. But it does prevent them, in conjunction with government, from denying couples that constitutional right.\n\n“The denial to same-sex couples of equality in marriage has been largely driven by what are referred to as ‘bigotry wrapped in prayer,’ ” he said. “This should have happened a long time ago. The denial should have never occurred.”\n\nProponents of the marriage ban have, and in all likelihood will continue, to use the state rights argument to battle federal decisions regarding state bans on same-sex marriages, Irigonegaray said. While it is possible the U.S. Supreme Court could rule the lower court erred in determining the federal government had any right to intervene in a state issue, he said, he “can’t imagine that happening.”\n\nMeanwhile, Kelly holds onto her hope for the LGBT community in Kansas: that after years of anxiety, fear and inequality, she will be able to live her life with a little more freedom — and exhale.",

Rick Bowmer, AP\n\nDENVER - A federal appeals court ruled for the first time Wednesday that gay couples have a constitutional right to marry, extending the movement's legal winning streak and bringing the issue a big step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe three-judge panel in Denver ruled 2-1 that states cannot deprive people of the fundamental right to marry simply because they choose a partner of the same sex.\n\nThe court dismissed as \"wholly illogical\" the notion that allowing gays to wed could somehow undermine traditional marriage.\n\nThe decision by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld a lower-court ruling that struck down Utah's gay marriage ban.

The Indiana and Utah rulings came just one day ahead of the anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision striking down part of a federal anti-gay marriage law.\n\nThe Utah ruling was especially significant because it was the first appellate court to conclude that last year's Supreme Court decision means states cannot deny gays the ability to marry.\n\nIn 2012, an appellate court struck down California's gay marriage ban but said it was only ruling on that law, not the broader constitutional questions. There were no such caveats in Wednesday's 65-page decision.\n\nEvan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry, said Utah's legal victory was sweeter because of where it originated - a conservative, deeply religious state in the heart of the mountain West.\n\n\"What is so powerful here is that we have the first federal appellate court and ... it's a case coming out of Utah affirming in the strongest, clearest, boldest terms that the Constitution guarantees the freedom to marry and equal protection for all Americans and all means all, including gay couples,\" he said.\n\nWithin hours of the Utah decision, the Boulder County, Colorado, clerk announced that she would issue marriage licenses to gay couples because Colorado's gay marriage ban would be voided if the decision stands.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, said on its website that it maintains marriage should be between a man and a woman, but believes \"all people should be treated with respect.\"\n\nIn his dissent, Justice Paul J.

However, the 10th US circuit court of appeals panel immediately put Wednesday's ruling on hold so it could be appealed, either to the entire 10th Circuit or directly to the nation's highest court.The decision gives increased momentum to a legal cause that already compiled an impressive winning streak in the lower courts after the Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates.The latest of those rulings was in Indiana, where a federal judge on Wednesday struck down that state's same-sex marriage ban in a ruling that immediately allows gay couples to wed. The Indiana attorney general's office said it will appeal.The appellate ruling on Utah comes 42 years after the Supreme Court refused to hear a case of two men who were refused a marriage license in Minnesota, finding there was no legal issue for the justices to consider, and just 10 years after 11 states voted to outlaw gay marriage.Now same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the Washington capital district. Recent polls show a majority of Americans support it.Two of the most striking lower court rulings were in the conservative states of Utah and Oklahoma, which saw their voter-approved gay marriage bans overturned in December and January, respectively. In Utah, more than 1,000 same-sex couples wed before the Supreme Court issued a stay.The 10th Circuit panel considered both cases. It did not rule on the Oklahoma ban.Though the Utah and Oklahoma cases have been closely watched, it is unclear whether they will be the first to reach the Supreme Court. The high court could choose from cases moving through five other federal appellate courts, and wouldn't consider a case until next year at the earliest.Attorneys representing Utah and Oklahoma argued voters have the right to define marriage in their states. Gay rights lawyers countered that they cannot do so in a way that deprives gay people of their fundamental rights. Plaintiffs in the Utah ruling celebrated.\"All I can say is that we are thrilled,'' said Kody Partridge, one of the Utah plaintiffs.

It becomes law in the six states covered by the 10th Circuit: Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. But the panel immediately put the ruling on hold pending an appeal.\n\nThe Utah attorney general's office will appeal the decision but is still assessing whether it will go directly to the U.S. Supreme Court or ask the entire 10th Circuit to review the ruling, spokeswoman Missy Larsen said.\n\n\"Although the Court's 2-1 split decision does not favor the State, we are pleased that the ruling has been issued and takes us one step closer to reaching certainty and finality for all Utahns on such an important issue with a decision from the highest court,\" the office said in a statement.\n\nWednesday afternoon, the couples named in the appeal hugged, cried and exchanged kisses at a news conference outside their attorney's offices in downtown Salt Lake City.\n\n\"This decision is an absolute victory for fairness and equality for all families in Utah, in every state in the 10th Circuit and every state in this great nation of the United States,\" said their attorney, Peggy Tomsic.\n\nPlaintiff Derek Kitchen said he and his partner, Moudi Sbeity, are \"so proud to be a part of history.\"\n\n\"It feels wonderful to be among one of the many same-sex couples across the country that are being respected and are offered dignity by the court system, and this is just emblematic of the United States judicial process,\" Kitchen said. \"I don't think that the state of Utah can continue to deny same-sex couples their rights for much longer.\"\n\nThe decision gives increased momentum to a legal cause that already has compiled an impressive record in the lower courts after the Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act.

            "text": "DENVER (AP) — A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that states must allow gay couples to marry, finding the Constitution protects same-sex relationships and putting a remarkable legal winning streak across the country one step closer to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe three-judge panel in Denver ruled 2-1 that states cannot deprive people of the fundamental right to marry simply because they want to be wedded to someone of the same sex.\n\nThe judges added they don't want to brand as intolerant those who oppose gay marriage, but said there is no reasonable objection to the practice.\n\n\"It is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of same-sex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of opposite-sex couples,\" they wrote, addressing arguments that the ruling could undermine traditional marriage.\n\nThe decision by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld a lower court ruling that struck down Utah's gay marriage ban. However, the panel immediately put Wednesday's ruling on hold so it could be appealed, either to the entire 10th Circuit or directly to the nation's highest court.\n\n\"All I can say is that we are thrilled,\" said Kody Partridge, one of the Utah plaintiffs. She was working in the garden with her wife, Laurie Wood, when they heard about the ruling.\n\n\"This is such as historic thing, not just for Utah but for Laurie and me\" and plaintiffs across the country, Partridge said. \"This is a big day.\"\n\nThe decision gives increased momentum to a legal cause that already compiled an impressive winning streak in the lower courts after the Supreme Court last year struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act. Since then, 16 federal judges have issued rulings siding with gay marriage advocates.\n\nThe latest of those rulings was in Indiana, where a federal judge on Wednesday struck down that state's same-sex marriage ban in a ruling that immediately allows gay couples to wed.\n\nTwo of the most striking lower court rulings were in the conservative states of Utah and Oklahoma, which saw their voter-approved gay marriage bans overturned in December and January, respectively. In Utah, more than 1,000 same-sex couples wed before the Supreme Court issued a stay.\n\nThe 10th Circuit panel considered both cases. It did not rule on the Oklahoma ban.\n\nSharon Baldwin, one of the plaintiffs in the Oklahoma case, said moments after the Utah ruling that she felt positive because the two cases are so similar.\n\n\"We're thrilled for the plaintiffs in Utah,\" she said. \"We think this is wonderful news, and we're excited to see our ruling coming soon.\"\n\nGay marriage opponents, meanwhile, have vowed to continue their fight. Along with the Catholic Church, several other major denominations remain adamant in opposing same-sex marriage.\n\n\"While judges can, by judicial fiat, declare same-sex 'marriage' legal, they will never be able to make it right,\" Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said in a statement. \"The courts, for all their power, can't overturn natural law.\"\n\nIn his dissent Wednesday, 10th Circuit Justice Paul J. Kelly Jr. said the court was overstepping its authority and that states should be able to decide who can marry.\n\n\"We should resist the temptation to become philosopher-kings, imposing our views under the guise of the Fourteenth Amendment,\" he wrote.\n\nThough the Utah and Oklahoma cases have been closely watched, it is unclear whether they will be the first to reach the Supreme Court. The high court could choose from cases moving through five other federal appellate courts, and wouldn't consider a case until next year at the earliest.\n\nAttorneys representing Utah and Oklahoma argued voters have the right to define marriage in their states. Gay rights lawyers countered that they cannot do so in a way that deprives gay people of their fundamental rights.\n\nThe appellate ruling comes 42 years after the Supreme Court refused to hear a case of two men who were refused a marriage license in Minnesota, finding there was no legal issue for the justices to consider, and just 10 years after 11 states voted to outlaw gay marriage.\n\nNow same-sex marriage is legal in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Recent polls show a majority of Americans support it.\n\nRuling from 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/13/13-4178.pdf\n\nAssociated Press writer Kristi Eaton in Oklahoma City contributed to this report.",

simply because they want to be wedded to someone of the same sex the judges added they dont want to brand as intolerant those who oppose gay marriage but said there is no reasonable objection to the practice it is wholly illogical to believe that state recognition of love and commitment of samesex couples will alter the most intimate and personal decisions of oppositesex couples they wrote addressing arguments that the ruling could undermine traditional marriage the decision by the 10th us circuit court of appeals panel upheld a lower court ruling that struck down utahs gay marriage ban however the panel immediately put wednesdays ruling on hold so it could be appealed either to the entire 10th circuit or directly to the nations highest court via federal appeals court utah cant ban

love my us senator dick durbin july 15 2013 dear mr black thank you for contacting me about employment nondiscrimination i appreciate hearing from you throughout my service in congress i have supported legislation to end discrimination based on factors such as race religion and sexual orientation fair and equal treatment of all americans is a cornerstone of our society and our political system unfortunately despite great progress the struggle for civil rights and equal treatment under the law continues today for many citizens in each of the last several congresses including the 112th i have cosponsored the employment nondiscrimination act this measure would prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation specifically it would make it unlawful for employers to discharge or refuse to hire any individual or limit any individuals employment opportunities based on that persons sexual orientation as a member of the senate judiciary committee and as a longtime supporter of employment nondiscrimination efforts i will continue to work toward the goals of this legislation thanks again for sharing your views please feel free to keep in touch sincerely united

But that doesn’t mean the fight for equality is relegated to the cities.\n\nEvery one of us can and should carry the ideals of Pride to every corner of this great country. It’s each individual’s actions that carry those ideals forward. Whether you’re out and proud in small town America, act as a role model to others in the work place, or by just being yourself and changing the hearts and minds of neighbors, family and friends you advance the opportunity for equality.\n\nThe parades celebrate how far we have come but it’s up to each of us on a daily basis to continue to build a future for the next generation so they can live their lives without prejudice, without bullying and without fear of losing their jobs.\n\nI’m constantly reminded and motivated by the words of Harvey Milk.\n\nNow go… Go celebrate Pride in your own way, enjoy how far we’ve come and continue the daily fight for full equality!",
