While the North did not reveal further details about the tests, they could be related to the projectiles that the South claimed were fired toward the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, because there were no other test-firing drills reported in recent days, according to Associated Press, or AP.\n\n“The guided missiles soared into the sky with a thunderous roar,” KCNA reportedly said. “The test-fire clearly proved that the tactical guided weapons didn’t have an inch of deviation in their scientific and technological performance.”\n\nSouth Korean defense ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said, at a briefing, according to Bloomberg: “From North Korea’s point of view, it may be a new weapon, but compared to the international trend, it’s already been developed.\"\n\nAccording to reports, South Korean officials are investigating the exact nature of the projectiles that were fired.\n\n“It’s still unclear if North Korea test-fired new weapons, or launched them for intentional provocation,” a spokesman told Agence France-Presse, or AFP, according to Defense News.\n\nThe South Korean defense spokesman also reportedly said Friday that North Korea’s latest test was to upgrade its large-caliber multiple rocket launching system, or MRL. \"The MRL ranges have been extended and guidance capabilities added to the projectiles,\" the spokesman said, according to AFP.\n\nAccording to AP, North Korea’s official media outlet called the latest missile launches “significant” because they were made at a time when the North, which has claimed that the U.S. and South Korea are “going extremely reckless in the moves to isolate and stifle (North Korea) and unleash a war of aggression,” has been attempting to strengthen its arsenal.\n\nWhile short-range test firings by North Korea are reportedly not uncommon, military tension between the two Koreas has elevated over missile and artillery tests conducted earlier this year.\n\nU.S. state department spokeswoman Marie Harf said, according to AFP: “Technically, obviously any launch of anything is problematic, is escalatory in nature, is threatening.\"",

            "text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - North Korea said Friday that leader Kim Jong Un has guided the test launches of its newly developed precision guided missiles, in a possible reference to three short-range projectiles South Korean officials say the North fired toward its waters a day earlier.\n\nSouth Korean defense officials said the projectiles fired from an eastern port city Thursday flew about 190 kilometers (120 miles) before harmlessly landing into the waters off its east coast. The exact type of those projectiles and the North’s intentions weren’t immediately known.\n\nThe North’s state media said Friday that the country tested what it calls “cutting-edge ultra-precision tactical guided missiles” and Kim watched the tests with top deputies and was satisfied with the results.\n\nThere is virtually no way to independently confirm whether North Korea has developed such high-tech missiles. North Korea has frequently bluffed and exaggerated about its military capability, and its army, though one of the world’s largest, is seen as running on outdated equipment and short supplies amid the nation’s chronic economic problems, according to foreign analysts.\n\nStill, the impoverished North devotes much of its scarce resources to its missile and nuclear programs, which subsequently pose a serious threat to South Korea, Japan and tens of thousands of U.S. troops in the region. Outside analysts say North Korea has developed a handful of crude nuclear devices and is working toward building a warhead small enough to mount on a long-range missile, although most experts say that goal may take years to achieve.\n\nThe North didn’t say when the latest launches took place or how many missiles were fired, but they are likely the projectiles that Seoul says North Korea fired Thursday as there have been no other such reported firings by North Korea in recent days.\n\nSouth Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said Friday that North Korea has been trying to upgrade its large-caliber multiple rocket launch systems in recent years and that those weapons’ range has been slightly and gradually increased in each test-launch.\n\nThe North Korean media dispatch Friday called the latest missile launches “significant” because they were made at a time when it is bolstering its national defense because the U.S. and South Korea are “going extremely reckless in the moves to isolate and stifle (North Korea) and unleash a war of aggression.”\n\nShort-range test firings by North Korea aren’t unusual, but a barrage of missile and artillery tests earlier this year boosted tension between the rivals. A North Korean artillery attack in 2010 killed four South Koreans on a front-line Yellow Sea island.\n\nNorth Korea has in recent months threatened South Korea’s president, calling her a prostitute, and the South has vowed to hit North Korea hard if provoked. North Korea’s rising anger coincided with annual joint military exercises by the U.S. and South Korea and a visit to Seoul by President Barack Obama. North Korea also test-fired two medium-range ballistic missiles and exchanged artillery fire with South Korea near a disputed boundary in the Yellow Sea.\n\nOn Thursday, North Korea’s army accused South Korea of firing shells into the North’s waters near the sea boundary. The North Korean army in the front-line area is “full of the strong will of retaliation to punish the provocateurs to the last one by giving vent to their pent-up grudge,” said the army statement carried by Pyongyang’s Korean Central News Agency.\n\nBoth Koreas routinely conduct artillery drills near the maritime boundary, a scene of several bloody skirmishes in recent years.\n\nThe Korean Peninsula is still technically in a state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty. The United States keeps about 28,500 troops in the South.",

Gen. Kim Rak Gyom and other senior command staff of the SRF.  KJU’s last observed appearance was his visit to the recently constructed Kalma Foodstuffs Factory.\n\nAfter receiving a briefing on the rocket drill, Kim Jong Un ordered that the drill commence.  KCNA reported that the drill “smoothly conducted on the basis of a scientific calculation of the whole course of the rocket firing and the scrupulous security check and search for flight orbit and targeted waters” and “had no slight impact not only on the regional peace and security but on international navigation order and ecological environment.”  After the drill, KJU “expressed great satisfaction over the successful firing of tactical rockets” and participated in a commemorative photo-op with KPA service member and officer participants in the drill.\n\nAccording to KCNA, Kim Jong Un said that “the peaceful environment dearest to the DPRK people can neither be provided by someone nor can be bartered for anything” and  “that as durable peace can be protected only when one is so strong that nobody dares provoke one and it can be guaranteed by one’s own strength, it is necessary to put the biggest spurs to bolstering up the self-defensive deterrent of the KPA in every way to protect the security and peace of the country and firmly defend the gains of the revolution.”  He “underscored the need to round off the combat readiness of the strategic force so that no aggressors may recklessly dare threaten and infringe upon the cause, sovereignty and vital rights of the DPRK and to further develop and perfect Chuch’e-oriented rocket science and technology and firing methods.”  Kim Jong Un also “expressed great expectation and belief that the service personnel of the strategic force would keep themselves fully ready to fire the highly effective ballistic rockets any moment on high alert as required by the prevailing situation and the developing revolution and thus foil the reckless acts of the U.S. imperialists and their followers who are steeped in evil repugnancy and pursue inveterate hostile policy toward the DPRK and provide a firm guarantee for the building of a thriving socialist nation.”\n\nThe test firing of the Scuds (or “ballistic rockets”) was observed around 5:00 KST on 29 June, the DPRK test fired two short-range Scuds, again from a site near Wo’nsan.\n\nOn 27 June (Friday) that KJU attended the test firing of tactical guided missiles.  Attending this test firing with him were VMar Hwang Pyong So, Gen. Pyon In Son (Director of the KPA General Staff Operations Bureau), Col. Gen. Pak Jong Chon (Vice Chief of the KPA General Staff) and Hong Yong Chil (Deputy [vice] Director of the Workers’ Party of Korea [WPK] Machine-Building Industry Department).  KJU’s last observed appearance at that time was a visit to the construction of the Pyongyang Baby Home and Orphanage.\n\nAfter being briefed on on the “the tactical and technological information of the newly developed guided missiles” Kim Jong ordered that the test firing commence.

This greatly encourages the service personnel and people of the DPRK.\"\n\nNorth Korea's remarks have come a day after the isolated country test-launched three short-range projectiles into the East Sea. South Korean experts have said the latest announcement mostly refers to this test-firing.\n\n\"Our analysis of its trajectory and other details led us to believe that what North Korea fired off yesterday was the 300-millimeter multiple-rocket launchers. North Korea appears to test-fire them to extend its range further,\" an official with the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.",

congratulate the libyan people on yesterdays elections and taking an important steps towards advancing a free prosperous democratic and secure libya we also condemn in the strongest terms the senseless and brutal murder of libyan human rights activists salwa bugaighis as we condemn all terror violence and intimidation in libya we mourn salwas death with her family and with all libyans she was a courageous woman and a true libyan patriot she was an advocate for political prisoners during the qadhafi regime an organizer of demonstrations against the regime during the february 17 th 2011 revolution a political activist and an original member of the transitional national council after the uprising began salwa resigned in protest over the absence of womens voices in the council but continued to play an active and powerful role supporting democracy human rights and the participation of women in libyan politics until she was murdered on the day she and other libyans went to the polls to elect a new government her voice will live on fighting for the causes that inspired her and will mean so much for all libyans as well second item at the top on ukraine today marks one month since russia based backed – excuse me – russiabacked separatists kidnapped four osce special monitoring mission observers in eastern ukraine three days later separatists abducted another four osce observers these eight international observers continue to be held hostage osce monitors are in ukraine to observe and report the facts impartially we condemn these abductions and call on russia indeed itself a member of the osce to use its influence with the separatists to secure the immediate release of the monitors and to guarantee the security of the osce monitoring teams with that kick us off question okay lets try and make this one quick ms harf yeah question on ukraine earlier today as you are well aware the secretary met with french foreign minister ms harf fabius he did yes question fabius and he – im curious if you can extrapolate a little bit or elaborate a little bit on his – what he meant when he said that russia has hours literally hours ms harf yeah question to basically show goodwill to move to disarm the separatists what – hours is less than days clearly what exactly happens if they dont meet this hours literally deadline ms harf well a couple points on timing the weeklong ceasefire expires tomorrow so thats partly what was driving the secretary when he was talking about timing also the european council is meeting tomorrow to discuss among other things possible additional sanctions against russia weve been very clear that we remain prepared to impose additional sanctions including sectoral should circumstances warrant i think there were some questions about this the other day but the march 20 th executive order authorizes the secretary of the treasury to sanction any individual or entity determined to operate in such sectors as – of the russian economy that we would want to sanction so we have in place the infrastructure to do this very quickly if we want to the secretary wasnt outlining specific timing for additional sanctions but underscoring the need that this needs to happen quickly question but ms harf including partly because of the ceasefire expiring tomorrow question right but there has been discussion on both sides about extending the ceasefire ms harf there has been question thats still something youre supportive of correct ms harf as long as the parties that have signed up to it abide by it question right ms harf so yes if – of course if we could get an extension that people abide by that would be a good thing question have the parties to date abided by the ceasefire ms harf some of them have and some of them havent some of the separatists have some of the separatists have not question would – but the ukrainian government ms harf the ukrainian government has abided by the terms of the ceasefire the only time they have taken action is after they have themselves been attacked question all right and – but given what the secretary said in terms of hours literally is it not more likely that sanctions would come later today or tomorrow given the fact that the ceasefire expires in ms harf i dont have any predictions for you on timing question but he wasnt inaudible discuss the timing of sanctions with that comment ms harf he was not he was not no i mean in general weve said we could do it very quickly but no he was not talking about anything specifically question can i ask you a couple of followups on this ms harf uhhuh question is the united states as it has done in the past willing to move forward on additional sanctions on russia without the european union if they do not vote for such sanctions ms harf well in general as you know weve remained very coordinated with them on the sanctions we think thats important to do but we make sanctions decisions on our own based on our own economy and our own interests but again believe that theyre strongest when theyre in partnership with each other question but you reserve the right to do it on your own if you feel necessary ms harf certainly but obviously weve remained coordinated with them because we think its important to do them together question the authorities under the previous – under the executive order that you referenced i think are – and as you read them – are targeting individuals and companies correct ms harf so they authorized the secretary of the treasury to sanction any individual or entity determined to operate in such sectors of the russian federation economy as may be determined by again the secretary in consultation with the secretary of state these sectors include financial services energy metals and mining engineering or defense or related materiel question okay and the pings are from europe that theyre not going to go forward tomorrow although obviously ms harf well weve obviously been talking to them and i think we would just need to wait and see what happens tomorrow question yeah question change topic iraq question i have one more on ukraine actually ms harf okay question today the us chamber of commerce and the national association of manufacturers took out a full page ad in three leading us publications i wanted to know if you had any comment on that ms harf they did so since the beginning of the crisis in ukraine we have had frequent conversations with business leaders and the business community on this issue to explain exactly our policy and understand their concerns and in general our sanctions policy towards russia has been designed to maximize the pressure and the impact on russia while minimizing the impact on the west and the united states economy as well so were trying to do things to change russias decision making obviously in a very strategic and targeted way that increases the pressure on them while again not doing so in a way that doesnt come back on us weve had those conversations with the business community since the beginning of this crisis question and youre still continuing to have those conversations with them ms harf we are we are yes question and so does that mean that the business community is aware of the sanction – of what the sanctions are ms harf that have already been put in place question no the ones that are potentially coming ms harf we dont discuss with anyone outside of the government what sanctions might be coming for obvious reasons in the future what ive said in our discussions weve talked to the business community about what weve already put in place and our overall strategic goal for how we decide on sanctions question well that doesnt seem to make – if youre trying to minimize the impact on american companies it would seem to be – it would not seem to make sense not to tell them what youre thinking about for this in the future ms harf theres plenty of people inside this government that do the calculations about minimizing the risk to our companies and our economy obviously there are good reasons not to tell people outside of the government what sanctions might be coming because if someone were to find out they might be coming they could take steps to move their assets around so thats why we keep that private and internal but we have the discussions with the business community in general about this issue question no no no im not talking about sanctions that you would impose on russian individuals but sectoral sanctions that might limit us companies ability to do business in russia ms harf well we talk in general about the concept and how it might impact our economy thats certainly true but we dont specifically talk about new sanctions that might be coming specifically in terms of what individuals or what companies with folks outside of the government question its my understanding that some of the sanctions that are in the ms harf pipeline question ready to go if and when a decisions made would impact us companies doing business in russia ms harf well were considering a wide range of sanctions and dont have any comment on the specifics of what they might impact question okay im not – but im not even talking about the specifics i just – but if you dont consult with businesses ms harf were consulting with them obviously question well but ms harf in general about the concept matt but there are very good reasons not to tell people outside of the government what specific sanctions were going to put in place question well then i dont see how that minimizes the impact on us companies ms harf there are a lot people inside this government who can do very good calculations about how potential sanctions might impact us companies or us – the us economy question well then why dont ms harf and they do those calculations and we take them into account when were deciding what additional sanctions to put in place question right well yeah but who knows better how a specific sanction is going to affect a us company than that company itself ms harf well again we have people who are very good at looking at that inside the department of the treasury question and im ms harf and we have good reasons not to discuss specifics with people outside question okay well im sure that fortune ms harf do you want russian oligarchs moving assets around because they might accidentally find out its coming question no no no no im not talking about – no im not talking about the impact on russians or telling them that person x in russia is going to be affected but if there are sanctions that are going to impact us companies ability to do business in russia which i am led to believe there are in the pipeline it strikes me as a bit unusual that you wouldnt talk to the companies about what could possibly be coming so that they could protect themselves ms harf we talk in general about what possibly might be coming question i understand but youre saying that there are people in the government who know – youre suggesting that people in government know better about ms harf im not saying that matt look youre taking us down a rabbit hole here question i dont want to especially today but ms harf i know but you are but wait let me finish up with one point we talk to them in general i just read a bunch of sectors right question right ms harf we talk to them in general about what those might look like and how they might impact the american economy and american companies those discussions can be very robust without saying on x date were going to sanction x company because there are very good reason we dont give that information out to people but we are very – we have very robust discussions about ways to minimize the impact we really do question okay ms harf yes question offmike ms harf on ukraine question yes maam ms harf okay question maam as far as sanctions against russia is concerned are you in touch with other countries other than the nato or europeans like china and india and other countries ms harf weve been in touch with a wide range of countries on this issue i dont have a full list in front of me but im happy to see if theres more specifics question thank you maam ms harf yeah said question iraq ms harf uhhuh question today prime minister maliki claimed that his government forces are taking back the initiative first of all do you agree and second is this attributable to lets say us advisors on the ground iranian boots on the ground or the syrian air strikes or all three in your opinion ms harf well said the situation on the ground remains very fluid and to be very clear iraqs security situation can not and should not be resolved by the assad regime by air strikes from the assad regime or by militias funded and supported by other countries in the region stepping in what we really need to see is the army get back on its feet we have folks there trying to help these elite units do that and start to retake territory but the situation on the ground is still very serious question so you agree that these elements coming together may have affected the situation on the ground ms harf i didnt say that i said actually the opposite that its – the security situation cant be resolved by the assad regime question can not be ms harf can not correct that thats not the situation that we need to see here in iraq that what we need to see is political leaders step up and military leaders step up bring the army back together push back – with help from us of course but look the situation on the ground remains very serious very fluid and there are still huge security challenges for the iraqi forces question seeing how the meeting the planned meeting between secretary kerry and the king of saudi arabia ms harf mmhmm question after he met with the saudi foreign minister is it – are we likely to see an american request or an american demand that the saudis cease their support to isil ms harf well as i said yesterday we dont have evidence that any government is supporting isil in the region so i want to be very clear about that when were talking about funding weve worked very closely with the saudis and other partners in the region who are very concerned about the security situation in iraq they dont want to see whats happening in iraq they understand the terrorist threat as well the saudis have suffered at the hands of terrorists for many years so well have the conversation – the secretary will tomorrow with king abdullah the president asked him to go update him on his meetings there and again were in this fight together for the sake of iraq and encouraging saudis and other regional partners to use their influence with different parts of the iraqi leadership to push them to all come together to form an inclusive government as soon as possible and help iraq get back on its feet question when you mentioned with help from us ms harf uhhuh question the iraqi government so – but you dont want anyone else to help them or ms harf well question is there ms harf any kind of assistance that anyone could give here needs to be towards the goal of a inclusive government question and are you specifically referring to iran ms harf well any assistance and we have said that question so youre not necessarily opposed to assad helping them as long as it meets your criteria for not inflaming the sectarian tensions ms harf im not sure how anything the assad regime could do could be anything other than inflaming sectarian tensions to be clear so question okay but you dont feel the same way about iran ms harf no look question that iran could play a positive role but syria – assads syria can not ms harf well anything that iran or anyone else should be doing in iraq should not be sectarian in any nature and anything that were to be sectarian would be very problematic so were watching right now certainly what the iranians are doing there weve all seen the reports and i cant confirm them but weve seen the reports and we would not support anything that was sectarian in nature so while we may have a common enemy we dont always have the same strategic interests question i understand that ms harf yeah question but you dont think that assad at all regardless of what he says hes doing or regardless of what he actually does is able to play a helpful role here but iran is im just trying to make a distinction if ms harf well im question im trying to find out if you make ms harf youre trying to make it very black and white question well im trying to find out if you if the united states believes theres a distinction between iranian help and syrian help ms harf i think theres a distinction and let me see if i can explain this in the right way iran could play a constructive role if it did things to promote an inclusive government im not saying they have done those things but they could question okay ms harf that is very different than an assad regime who is responsible in large part for the rise and strength of isil who has created a security situation where isil could flourish and now may be taking some action – i have no reason to believe that theyre not thats not in any way helpful to iraqs security question okay but you could not repeat that sentence iran could play a helpful role with – replace iran with syria saying syria under assad could ms harf i mean i guess everythings possible in a hypothetical matt but question okay ms harf theyre very different situations question got it question could you repeat something that you said you said we have – we share a common enemy but we dont share ms harf but we may not question a common purpose is that what you – no ms harf no you got to listen said question okay im ms harf i said question thats why i asked ms harf i know you are no i said we may share a common enemy look we all understand the threat from isil including the iranians that doesnt necessarily mean we have a shared strategic interest we would like everyone to because we think thats whats in the best interests of iraq question thank you ms harf yes and i know youre listening you listen better than most in this room so yes question maliki confirmed to bbc that the syrian air forces bombed the area in iraq can you confirm that today ms harf well as i said yesterday i dont have reason to believe its not the case i think prime minister maliki probably has the most uptodate information on that but again this isnt what we need to see for iraq going forward we know look any action that hinders isils ability to move is tactically maybe a good thing but strategically this is not what needs to happen to get iraq back in a better place question there ms harf yeah elliot question sorry there were reports from baghdad that reprisal killings against sunnis are becoming more and more frequent is the us doing anything at this time to try and prevent this from becoming more of an issue than it already is ms harf well we are following the reports closely certainly weve seen executionstyle killings of thousands of iraqi soldiers policemen government leaders also some of the ethnic minorities and religious minority populations as well so we are working with our international partners very closely to see how we can deal with this sort of what i would call an even worse than humanitarian situation were working with the iraqi government to help on this also with the un as well so were monitoring it and obviously thats – i think just underscores the notion that iraqs political leaders needs a form of government as soon as possible bring the country together and use their influence to try and stop some of this question this might be better addressed to dod but do you have any – are you aware of any specific role that us special forces are playing in that regard as they try to train and ms harf its a good question let me check with – you can check with them i can check with them as well and see if they are i know that the folks theyve sent in are in at the moment an assessment role working with the army about the isil threat but let me see if theres more i can share yes matt question can we go to ms harf yeah go ahead question sudan so the reports are that ms ibrahim has been released do you know – do you have any details on this ms harf so before i came out question oh rereleased ms harf again this is a very fluid situation and things are happening every minute here but before i came out it was our understanding that she was still at the police station which was where she was being held this morning dc time again very fluid situation so i cant confirm these reports that she has been released we are in communication with the sudanese foreign ministry to ensure that she and her family will be free to travel as quickly as possible again she had been detained while issues related to her travel and identification documents were sorted out and from our perspective meriam has all of the documents she needs to travel to and enter the united states its up to the government of sudan to allow her to exit the country as i said were working with them on that right now question okay from our perspective can you just – can you eliminate that and just say she has the travel – valid travel documents and ms harf again were working with the government of sudan on that question can you – would – are you hopeful that shell be able to get out today ms harf were hopeful that shell be able to get out soon i just dont want to predict question and would you expect her destination when she does leave to be the united states ms harf well i dont have anything specific but as i just said we – in terms of our perspective she has the necessary documents she needs to travel to the united states question does that mean she has a visa to enter the united states ms harf i dont have more specifics for you on what documents – what those documents might look like question why not just out of curiosity why not ms harf because we dont always give out those specific details for a variety of reasons some of which are privacy some of which are bureaucratic just dont always share those but i gave you a new line today on travel documents question i did notice that ms harf laughter question a new topic ms harf yeah question so the south korean military today said that north korea launched four projectiles into the sea of japan ms harf yes question today does this raise concerns that north koreas increasing its provocations ms harf i think were always concerned whenever north korea launches anything i think thats probably fair to say and we are aware of i think three projectiles did you say three or four im sorry question i believe its being reported as three ms harf okay right so that north korea launched three projectiles from its southeast coast were monitoring the situation and were still evaluating the available information to identify the exact type of projectile that may have been launched question and assuming that they did launch these projectiles would this be a violation of un resolutions ms harf it depends it depends on what they were technically obviously any launch of anything is problematic is escalatory in nature is threatening so obviously we wouldnt agree with any launch but in terms of the technicality it depends on what they were question israel ms harf yeah question quick question for ms harf oh yeah uhhuh question one more on north korea one question – i realize that north korea has a very different system of freedom of speech and different ideas on that than the united states but the north koreans ms harf thats the understatement of the day i think laughter question the north koreans called on the united states to ban the film the interview ms harf i was wondering why i didnt get this yesterday i was surprised question do you have a response to that question great film ms harf i really dont they i think had a fairly strong reaction to it and really i think im going to steer clear of commenting on it so question do you see a connection between the movie and the projectile launch ms harf not to my knowledge but im happy to check i just – i dont think i have any analysis to do on that question a quick question question are there any observations of why the north koreans might be so upset about this does it show that more outside information is seeping in ms harf its a good question im happy to check with our folks i just dont know the answer yes question quick question on israel ms harf uhhuh question apparently today foreign minister avigdor lieberman during his meeting with secretary kerry suggested that israel would help moderate arab countries to fight isil is this something that the united states would look kindly on or would encourage israel to do ms harf well question or would advise against ms harf just a quick little readout of that meeting they talked about the longterm relationship between the israelis and the palestinians they obviously talked about the missing israeli teenagers and the secretary reiterated his concern over the missing teenagers they also talked about iraq and isil as you mentioned and they had really a discussion about the longerterm threat coming from some of these groups and we welcome anyone in the region who is willing to stand up and help fight the threat that isil poses again really when it comes to iraq though this is a fight the iraqis need to take on themselves through their army and through their capabilities question well how can you say that you welcome anyone in the region and then tell assad that he cant ms harf assad – when you brutally massacre question anyone but assad question anyone else question anyone other than assad is welcome to help then ms harf look if assad were to stop killing his own people to stop using barrel bombs to lay down his weapons and agree to a transitional governing body sure we can have that discussion ill – i will wait for that to happen yeah question can i ask you question one question on iraq ms harf uhhuh question you said any help is welcome as long as it is not based on sectarian considerations ms harf right it needs to all be in the service of an inclusive government question is any iranian help – could it be anything else but sectarian ms harf well we judge actions by each one specifically and again i dont have all the details on what may or may not be going on but we know the history there but again i dont have more details to share with you on what iran is doing yes question another ms harf go to you next yeah question madam as far as security in south asia is concerned it depends on all stability in pakistan innocent pakistanis are being killed every day and there is civil and political unrest going on in the country and also now jihadists alqaida and talibans are now standing up against the innocent pakistanis that they will wage war against pakistan if the military operation continues against them in waziristan and all that my question is that india is also worried and also because you have a strategic interest in nextdoor neighbor in afghanistan so how us is helping or has pakistan asked for us help ms harf well you asked a lot about a lot there so let me just address a few quick points and then im going to arshad next look weve worked very closely with the pakistanis the threat from the taliban and other terrorist groups is not new weve worked with them very closely it doesnt just threaten the pakistanis it threatens afghanistan and india and has the united states in the past as well in terms of the current operations pakistan is undertaking in north waziristan this is an entirely led – pakistaniled and executed operation obviously we have long supported their efforts to extend the writ of government throughout their country and to increase internal stability and security but again these are – these current operations are an entire pakistaniled event thank you arshad question yeah just a quick one can you give us just a succinct simple description of the main issues that you expect the secretary and king abdullah to discuss tomorrow ms harf iraq syria clean and succinct enough for you question oil ms harf im sure question iran ms harf yeah im sure they will as well so obviously the isil threat in iraq how were working with the iraqis on this what the conversations the secretary had in iraq were like when it comes to syria weve said we will continue increasing our support to the opposition i think well have conversations about that next week we start the next round of the p51 talks with iran over its nuclear program im sure there will be mention of that oil is always a topic of conversation but i cant predict whether it will come up but frequently does question and lastly would you expect regardless of what the secretary might say about this that the issue of isil financing will come up ms harf i dont know i dont want to predict as i said we dont have any information that the government is – has supported from a funding perspective well see if it does i dont want to predict obviously its something were worried about question thank you ms harf yes last one question india question ive got two very brief ones ms harf okay okay all right question india thank you ms harf youre welcome question madam yesterday the carnegie experts were discussing about the new government of narendra modi in india and the usindia relations what they were discussing was that india and the new government now needs a massive investment to go forward and move forward the country because the 60 years corruption and all those things were going on my question is here so many things going on between the two countries official visits to india and all that during these visits have you been discussing about the massive investment in india ms harf well weve certainly – and i think this is what youre asking about we certainly talk quite a bit about the economic relationship with india whether its investing in certain parts of its economy whether its increasing exports and imports and private sector trade thats certainly been a key part of our discussions with the government of india not just since mr modi has been in office but before that for a long time as well yeah – two yeah question making good question staying on india ms harf okay stay on india question oh ms harf yeah question today in lahore jud chief hafiz saeed said that if us can do whatever it wants dont care they should prove if they have proof and then the foreign – pakistani foreign office spokesperson tasnim aslam said that pakistan is not under any obligation because its from us and not from un ms harf are you referring to the question yesterdays ms harf yesterdays – well the – or the designations that weve had on let have been in place for some time now for years and yesterday what we did was add additional aliases to make sure that we can increasingly cut off the funding and support to let through other – these other aliases that they use for their activities as well and look weve been very clear about the threat let poses question i know but ms harf and we have shared information from our assessment about the attack in herat with the indian government question no but question marie the un has also imposed sanction on let and hafiz saeed ms harf yes yes question so pakistan is under obligation to implement ms harf im happy to check with our un team about those specifics question no but when the foreign – foreign office spokesperson says that no obligation from the us its a partner state so what have you spoken ms harf well i havent seen those comments and i dont want to get into a titfortat with my counterpart in pakistan without seeing them so let me check obviously weve made very clear our concern about let thats why we put them on our designation list thats why we try to cut off funding and support to them let me check on those comments and im happy to see if theres more to share question oh and if – i know – two very brief ms harf yeah question on egypt if theres anything new on – in terms of contacts with the egyptians about ms harf nothing new weve been in continual contact with them but nothing new to highlight question and then question any more deliveries no deliveries of additional material ms harf no nothing has changed there no question and then making good on my promise from yesterday you have anything to say ms harf uhoh question about your position on the renaming of the street ms harf excuse me okay question yeah ms harf so lets see well much to your dismay i am not going to take a position on the naming of the street but i will say a few things about this gentleman the secretary put out a statement – i believe it was december 9th 2013 – marking the 5th anniversary of this nobel laureate and writers detention have called very clearly for his release from the chinese authorities to end his wifes house arrest and to guarantee him and his family members all internationallyrecognized human rights protections and freedoms so clearly we think this gentleman has played an important role in advancing dialogue and i think well probably leave it at that question which gentleman which ms harf so the person they want to name the street after – you want me to try and pronounce it is that what youre trying to get me to do question im just trying to – im wondering if youre not willing to say the name ms harf no i – oh no no no i just didnt want to mispronounce it question okay oh okay okay that ms harf its liu xiaobo question yeah ms harf so question so ms harf my pronunciations arent always the best though so question i didnt ms harf so in general what im saying is look im not taking a position on the legislation clearly we think that he – this person has been a voice should be released from prison his wifes house arrest should end – making very clear our feelings on him i dont want that to be caught up in the confusion of the fact that we wont take a position on this legislation question so you wont take a position on the legislation ms harf i will not from here at this time no question but the administration will and has ms harf publicly were not taking a position on it at this time question well it – will there come a time when you ms harf there may question will take a public – given the fact that this street is ms harf there may often as you know with legislation we dont take positions for some time and then we eventually do question right but given the fact that this is – this street is under federal – its the federal governments street ms harf mmhmm question and you have jurisdiction over it i would think that you would have an interest in – an interest that shouldnt – theres no reason for it to be a private position ms harf well were having those conversations with congress again im happy to take your advice about the fact that we should make those public back to them question so you believe that this guy should be released ms harf yes question but youre not – but you wont say whether you think he should be – whether its appropriate to ms harf for a street to be named after him yeah question any street anywhere ms harf i dont think i have any more on this street question i mean look question so it sounds like you dont support ms harf thats not what i said i did not at all say that question well if youre questioning the appropriateness of a street being named after him ms harf i didnt say that i didnt question it i said im taking no position on whether or not this street should be named after him at all question so do you know if the chinese have made their public complaint to you guys in private ms harf i can check i dont know question well without taking a position on the legislation do you think that such a move could aggravate your relationship with the chinese ms harf well i think by definition that would mean i was taking a position on the legislation if i did any analysis on it so as i said we think weve made very clear that he should be released weve made very clear that we think hes played an important role in advancing dialogue in china but again nothing – no position on the proposed legislation question i think well take that as a no question right but either the administration thinks that its ms harf i think you can assume what you want but you might be wrong question the – i dont understand this at all the administration either thinks its a good idea or an appropriate idea to honor him with – by renaming the street in front of the embassy or it thinks it is not appropriate or it takes no position you say ms harf i said publicly we are not taking a position which happens all the time with proposed legislation all the time matt this is not breaking news question forget about the question well it isnt all the time because sometimes you take a very public position on legislation ms harf actually it – much more often we dont take a position than we do much more often it is the – actually the exception to the rule that we will take a position on pending legislation question marie do you know who owns the street in front of the us embassy in beijing ms harf i dont question do you know who owns the street in front of the chinese embassy in washington ms harf as you noted i think its been widely reported that it is the property of the federal government question would you object to the chinese – if it is that the chinese who own the street in front of the us embassy in beijing would you object to them doing the same thing ms harf i am not even going to entertain that hypothetical question really if the chinese decided they wanted to come out and rename the street in front of the question edward snowden way laughter question edward snowden avenue or question benedict arnold boulevard laughter ms harf id be happy to have that conversation question or something like that question robert hanson way laughter ms harf im sure the chinese government is taking all of your suggestions on board right now question im sure that they had them – they were in their minds before ms harf were just not at this point look going to take a public position on this question i just cant see how its helpful to your diplomacy with the chinese not to take a position ms harf i will take your advice on board matt question all right lets go watch the soccer game question game time ms harf yes thank you question game time ms harf yes thank you and you saw the note were going to – in case people want were going to have it on the big screens here question well can we ask you about your attire today ms harf so

event and its all about sports diplomacy and bringing people together and where else can you get all these countries in one place to do something thats positive right and thats kind of amazing and ive

            "text": "11:32 p.m. EDT\n\nMS. HARF: Welcome to the daily briefing. Two quick items at the top and then happy to open it up to your questions.\n\nFirst, on Libya, as we congratulate the Libyan people on yesterday’s elections and taking an important steps towards advancing a free, prosperous, democratic, and secure Libya, we also condemn in the strongest terms the senseless and brutal murder of Libyan human rights activists Salwa Bugaighis, as we condemn all terror, violence, and intimidation in Libya. We mourn Salwa’s death with her family and with all Libyans. She was a courageous woman and a true Libyan patriot. She was an advocate for political prisoners during the Qadhafi regime; an organizer of demonstrations against the regime during the February 17th, 2011 revolution; a political activist; and an original member of the transitional national council after the uprising began.\n\nSalwa resigned in protest over the absence of women’s voices in the council, but continued to play an active and powerful role supporting democracy, human rights, and the participation of women in Libyan politics, until she was murdered on the day she and other Libyans went to the polls to elect a new government. Her voice will live on fighting for the causes that inspired her and will mean so much for all Libyans as well.\n\nSecond item at the top on Ukraine. Today marks one month since Russia based backed – excuse me – Russia-backed separatists kidnapped four OSCE special monitoring mission observers in eastern Ukraine. Three days later, separatists abducted another four OSCE observers. These eight international observers continue to be held hostage. OSCE monitors are in Ukraine to observe and report the facts impartially. We condemn these abductions and call on Russia, indeed itself a member of the OSCE, to use its influence with the separatists to secure the immediate release of the monitors and to guarantee the security of the OSCE monitoring teams.\n\nWith that, kick us off.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Let’s try and make this one quick.\n\nMS. HARF: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: On Ukraine, earlier today, as you are well aware, the Secretary met with French Foreign Minister --\n\nMS. HARF: Fabius. He did. Yes.\n\nQUESTION: -- Fabius. And he – I’m curious if you can extrapolate a little bit or elaborate a little bit on his – what he meant when he said that Russia has hours, literally hours --\n\nMS. HARF: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: -- to basically show goodwill to move to disarm the separatists. What – hours is less than days, clearly. What exactly happens if they don’t meet this “hours, literally” deadline?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, a couple points on timing. The weeklong ceasefire expires tomorrow, so that’s partly what was driving the Secretary when he was talking about timing. Also, the European Council is meeting tomorrow to discuss among other things possible additional sanctions against Russia. We’ve been very clear that we remain prepared to impose additional sanctions, including sectoral, should circumstances warrant. I think there were some questions about this the other day, but the March 20th executive order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to sanction any individual or entity determined to operate in such sectors as – of the Russian economy that we would want to sanction. So we have in place the infrastructure to do this very quickly if we want to.\n\nThe Secretary wasn’t outlining specific timing for additional sanctions but underscoring the need that this needs to happen quickly.\n\nQUESTION: But --\n\nMS. HARF: Including partly because of the ceasefire expiring tomorrow.\n\nQUESTION: Right. But there has been discussion on both sides about extending the ceasefire.\n\nMS. HARF: There has been.\n\nQUESTION: That’s still something you’re supportive of, correct?\n\nMS. HARF: As long as the parties that have signed up to it abide by it.\n\nQUESTION: Right.\n\nMS. HARF: So yes, if – of course, if we could get an extension that people abide by, that would be a good thing.\n\nQUESTION: Have the parties, to date, abided by the ceasefire?\n\nMS. HARF: Some of them have and some of them haven’t. Some of the separatists have, some of the separatists have not.\n\nQUESTION: Would – but the Ukrainian Government?\n\nMS. HARF: The Ukrainian Government has abided by the terms of the ceasefire. The only time they have taken action is after they have themselves been attacked.\n\nQUESTION: All right. And – but given what the Secretary said in terms of “hours, literally,” is it not more likely that sanctions would come later today or tomorrow, given the fact that the ceasefire expires in --\n\nMS. HARF: I don’t have any predictions for you on timing.\n\nQUESTION: But he wasn’t (inaudible) discuss the timing of sanctions with that comment.\n\nMS. HARF: He was not. He was not. No. I mean, in general, we’ve said we could do it very quickly. But no, he was not talking about anything specifically.\n\nQUESTION: Can I ask you a couple of follow-ups on this?\n\nMS. HARF: Uh-huh.\n\nQUESTION: Is the United States, as it has done in the past, willing to move forward on additional sanctions on Russia, without the European Union if they do not vote for such sanctions?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, in general, as you know, we’ve remained very coordinated with them on the sanctions. We think that’s important to do. But we make sanctions decisions on our own based on our own economy and our own interests, but again, believe that they’re strongest when they’re in partnership with each other.\n\nQUESTION: But you reserve the right to do it on your own if you feel necessary?\n\nMS. HARF: Certainly, but obviously we’ve remained coordinated with them because we think it’s important to do them together.\n\nQUESTION: The authorities under the previous – under the executive order that you referenced I think are – and as you read them – are targeting individuals and companies, correct?\n\nMS. HARF: So they authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to sanction any individual or entity determined to operate in such sectors of the Russian Federation economy as may be determined by, again, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State. These sectors include financial services, energy, metals and mining, engineering, or defense or related materiel.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. And the pings are from Europe that they’re not going to go forward tomorrow, although obviously --\n\nMS. HARF: Well, we’ve obviously been talking to them and I think we would just need to wait and see what happens tomorrow.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Change topic. Iraq?\n\nQUESTION: I have one more on Ukraine, actually.\n\nMS. HARF: Okay.\n\nQUESTION: Today the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers took out a full page ad in three leading U.S. publications. I wanted to know if you had any comment on that.\n\nMS. HARF: They did. So since the beginning of the crisis in Ukraine, we have had frequent conversations with business leaders and the business community on this issue to explain exactly our policy and understand their concerns. And in general, our sanctions policy towards Russia has been designed to maximize the pressure and the impact on Russia while minimizing the impact on the West and the United States economy as well. So we’re trying to do things to change Russia’s decision making, obviously, in a very strategic and targeted way that increases the pressure on them while, again, not doing so in a way that doesn’t come back on us. We’ve had those conversations with the business community since the beginning of this crisis.\n\nQUESTION: And you’re still continuing to have those conversations with them?\n\nMS. HARF: We are. We are. Yes.\n\nQUESTION: And so does that mean that the business community is aware of the sanction – of what the sanctions are?\n\nMS. HARF: That have already been put in place?\n\nQUESTION: No, the ones that are potentially coming.\n\nMS. HARF: We don’t discuss with anyone outside of the government what sanctions might be coming for obvious reasons in the future. What I’ve said, in our discussions we’ve talked to the business community about what we’ve already put in place and our overall strategic goal for how we decide on sanctions.\n\nQUESTION: Well, that doesn’t seem to make – if you’re trying to minimize the impact on American companies, it would seem to be – it would not seem to make sense not to tell them what you’re thinking about for this in the future.\n\nMS. HARF: There’s plenty of people inside this government that do the calculations about minimizing the risk to our companies and our economy. Obviously, there are good reasons not to tell people outside of the government what sanctions might be coming, because if someone were to find out they might be coming, they could take steps to move their assets around. So that’s why we keep that private and internal. But we have the discussions with the business community in general about this issue.\n\nQUESTION: No, no, no. I’m not talking about sanctions that you would impose on Russian individuals, but sectoral sanctions that might limit U.S. companies’ ability to do business in Russia.\n\nMS. HARF: Well, we talk in general about the concept and how it might impact our economy. That’s certainly true. But we don’t specifically talk about new sanctions that might be coming specifically in terms of what individuals or what companies with folks outside of the government.\n\nQUESTION: It’s my understanding that some of the sanctions that are in the --\n\nMS. HARF: Pipeline.\n\nQUESTION: -- ready to go if and when a decision’s made would impact U.S. companies doing business in Russia.\n\nMS. HARF: Well, we’re considering a wide range of sanctions and don’t have any comment on the specifics of what they might impact.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. I’m not – but I’m not even talking about the specifics. I just – but if you don’t consult with businesses --\n\nMS. HARF: We’re consulting with them, obviously --\n\nQUESTION: Well, but --\n\nMS. HARF: -- in general, about the concept, Matt. But there are very good reasons not to tell people outside of the government what specific sanctions we’re going to put in place.\n\nQUESTION: Well, then I don’t see how that minimizes the impact on U.S. companies.\n\nMS. HARF: There are a lot people inside this government who can do very good calculations about how potential sanctions might impact U.S. companies or U.S. – the U.S. economy.\n\nQUESTION: Well then, why don’t --\n\nMS. HARF: And they do those calculations, and we take them into account when we’re deciding what additional sanctions to put in place.\n\nQUESTION: Right. Well, yeah. But who knows better how a specific sanction is going to affect a U.S. company than that company itself?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, again, we have people who are very good at looking at that inside the Department of the Treasury.\n\nQUESTION: And I’m --\n\nMS. HARF: And we have good reasons not to discuss specifics with people outside.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Well, I’m sure that Fortune --\n\nMS. HARF: Do you want Russian oligarchs moving assets around because they might accidentally find out it’s coming?\n\nQUESTION: No. No, no, no. I’m not talking about – no. I’m not talking about the impact on Russians or telling them that person X in Russia is going to be affected. But if there are sanctions that are going to impact U.S. companies’ ability to do business in Russia, which I am led to believe there are in the pipeline, it strikes me as a bit unusual that you wouldn’t talk to the companies about what could possibly be coming so that they could protect themselves.\n\nMS. HARF: We talk in general about what possibly might be coming.\n\nQUESTION: I understand, but you’re saying that there are people in the government who know – you’re suggesting that people in government know better about --\n\nMS. HARF: I’m not saying that, Matt. Look, you’re taking us down a rabbit hole here.\n\nQUESTION: I don’t want to, especially today, but --\n\nMS. HARF: I know, but you are. But wait, let me finish up with one point. We talk to them in general. I just read a bunch of sectors, right?\n\nQUESTION: Right.\n\nMS. HARF: We talk to them in general about what those might look like and how they might impact the American economy and American companies. Those discussions can be very robust without saying on X date we’re going to sanction X company, because there are very good reason we don’t give that information out to people. But we are very – we have very robust discussions about ways to minimize the impact. We really do.\n\nQUESTION: Okay.\n\nMS. HARF: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nMS. HARF: On Ukraine?\n\nQUESTION: Yes, ma’am.\n\nMS. HARF: Okay.\n\nQUESTION: Ma’am, as far as sanctions against Russia is concerned, are you in touch with other countries other than the NATO or Europeans, like China and India and other countries?\n\nMS. HARF: We’ve been in touch with a wide range of countries on this issue. I don’t have a full list in front of me, but I’m happy to see if there’s more specifics.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you, ma’am.\n\nMS. HARF: Yeah, Said.\n\nQUESTION: Iraq.\n\nMS. HARF: Uh-huh.\n\nQUESTION: Today Prime Minister Maliki claimed that his government forces are taking back the initiative. First of all, do you agree? And second, is this attributable to, let’s say, U.S. advisors on the ground, Iranian boots on the ground, or the Syrian air strikes, or all three, in your opinion?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, Said, the situation on the ground remains very fluid. And to be very clear, Iraq’s security situation cannot and should not be resolved by the Assad regime, by air strikes from the Assad regime, or by militias funded and supported by other countries in the region stepping in. What we really need to see is the army get back on its feet. We have folks there trying to help these elite units do that and start to retake territory. But the situation on the ground is still very serious.\n\nQUESTION: So you agree that these elements coming together may have affected the situation on the ground?\n\nMS. HARF: I didn’t say that. I said actually the opposite, that it’s – the security situation can’t be resolved by the Assad regime.\n\nQUESTION: Cannot be?\n\nMS. HARF: Cannot, correct. That that’s not the situation that we need to see here in Iraq; that what we need to see is political leaders step up and military leaders step up, bring the army back together, push back – with help from us, of course.\n\nBut look, the situation on the ground remains very serious, very fluid, and there are still huge security challenges for the Iraqi forces.\n\nQUESTION: Seeing how the meeting, the planned meeting between Secretary Kerry and the King of Saudi Arabia --\n\nMS. HARF: Mm-hmm.\n\nQUESTION: -- after he met with the Saudi foreign minister, is it – are we likely to see an American request or an American demand that the Saudis cease their support to ISIL?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, as I said yesterday, we don’t have evidence that any government is supporting ISIL in the region, so I want to be very clear about that when we’re talking about funding. We’ve worked very closely with the Saudis and other partners in the region who are very concerned about the security situation in Iraq. They don’t want to see what’s happening in Iraq. They understand the terrorist threat as well; the Saudis have suffered at the hands of terrorists for many years. So we’ll have the conversation – the Secretary will tomorrow with King Abdullah. The President asked him to go update him on his meetings there. And again, we’re in this fight together for the sake of Iraq and encouraging Saudis and other regional partners to use their influence with different parts of the Iraqi leadership to push them to all come together to form an inclusive government as soon as possible and help Iraq get back on its feet.\n\nQUESTION: When you mentioned “with help from us” --\n\nMS. HARF: Uh-huh.\n\nQUESTION: -- the Iraqi Government, so – but you don’t want anyone else to help them or --\n\nMS. HARF: Well --\n\nQUESTION: -- is there --\n\nMS. HARF: -- any kind of assistance that anyone could give here needs to be towards the goal of a inclusive government.\n\nQUESTION: And are you specifically referring to Iran?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, any assistance, and we have said that --\n\nQUESTION: So you’re not necessarily opposed to Assad helping them as long as it meets your criteria for not inflaming the sectarian tensions?\n\nMS. HARF: I’m not sure how anything the Assad regime could do could be anything other than inflaming sectarian tensions, to be clear. So --\n\nQUESTION: Okay. But you don’t feel the same way about Iran?\n\nMS. HARF: No, look --\n\nQUESTION: That Iran could play a positive role, but Syria – Assad’s Syria cannot?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, anything that Iran or anyone else should be doing in Iraq should not be sectarian in any nature, and anything that were to be sectarian would be very problematic. So we’re watching right now certainly what the Iranians are doing there. We’ve all seen the reports, and I can’t confirm them, but we’ve seen the reports and we would not support anything that was sectarian in nature. So while we may have a common enemy, we don’t always have the same strategic interests.\n\nQUESTION: I understand that --\n\nMS. HARF: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: -- but you don’t think that Assad at all, regardless of what he says he’s doing or regardless of what he actually does, is able to play a helpful role here, but Iran is? I’m just trying to make a distinction if --\n\nMS. HARF: Well, I’m --\n\nQUESTION: I’m trying to find out if you make --\n\nMS. HARF: You’re trying to make it very black and white.\n\nQUESTION: Well, I’m trying to find out if you, if the United States believes there’s a distinction between Iranian help and Syrian help.\n\nMS. HARF: I think there’s a distinction, and let me see if I can explain this in the right way. Iran could play a constructive role if it did things to promote an inclusive government. I’m not saying they have done those things, but they could.\n\nQUESTION: Okay.\n\nMS. HARF: That is very different than an Assad regime who is responsible in large part for the rise and strength of ISIL, who has created a security situation where ISIL could flourish, and now may be taking some action – I have no reason to believe that they’re not. That’s not in any way helpful to Iraq’s security.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. But you could not repeat that sentence: Iran could play a helpful role with – replace Iran with Syria, saying Syria under Assad could --\n\nMS. HARF: I mean, I guess everything’s possible in a hypothetical, Matt, but --\n\nQUESTION: Okay.\n\nMS. HARF: -- they’re very different situations.\n\nQUESTION: Got it.\n\nQUESTION: Could you repeat something that you said? You said we have – we share a common enemy, but we don’t share --\n\nMS. HARF: But we may not --\n\nQUESTION: -- a common purpose. Is that what you – no?\n\nMS. HARF: No. You got to listen, Said.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. I’m --\n\nMS. HARF: I said --\n\nQUESTION: That’s why I asked.\n\nMS. HARF: I know you are. No, I said we may share a common enemy. Look, we all understand the threat from ISIL, including the Iranians. That doesn’t necessarily mean we have a shared strategic interest. We would like everyone to, because we think that’s what’s in the best interests of Iraq.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nMS. HARF: Yes. And I know you’re listening. You listen better than most in this room. So, yes.\n\nQUESTION: Maliki confirmed to BBC that the Syrian air forces bombed the area in Iraq. Can you confirm that today?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, as I said yesterday, I don’t have reason to believe it’s not the case. I think Prime Minister Maliki probably has the most up-to-date information on that. But again, this isn’t what we need to see for Iraq going forward. We know, look, any action that hinders ISIL’s ability to move is tactically maybe a good thing, but strategically this is not what needs to happen to get Iraq back in a better place.\n\nQUESTION: There --\n\nMS. HARF: Yeah, Elliot.\n\nQUESTION: Sorry. There were reports from Baghdad that reprisal killings against Sunnis are becoming more and more frequent. Is the U.S. doing anything at this time to try and prevent this from becoming more of an issue than it already is?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, we are following the reports closely, certainly. We’ve seen execution-style killings of thousands of Iraqi soldiers, policemen, government leaders, also some of the ethnic minorities and religious minority populations as well. So we are working with our international partners very closely to see how we can deal with this sort of what I would call an even worse than humanitarian situation. We’re working with the Iraqi Government to help on this, also with the UN as well. So we’re monitoring it, and obviously that’s – I think just underscores the notion that Iraq’s political leaders needs a form of government as soon as possible, bring the country together, and use their influence to try and stop some of this.\n\nQUESTION: This might be better addressed to DOD, but do you have any – are you aware of any specific role that U.S. special forces are playing in that regard as they try to train and --\n\nMS. HARF: It’s a good question. Let me check with – you can check with them, I can check with them as well and see if they are. I know that the folks they’ve sent in are in, at the moment, an assessment role working with the army about the ISIL threat. But let me see if there’s more I can share.\n\nYes, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: Can we go to --\n\nMS. HARF: Yeah. Go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: Sudan? So the reports are that Ms. Ibrahim has been released. Do you know – do you have any details on this ?\n\nMS. HARF: So before I came out --\n\nQUESTION: Oh, rereleased.\n\nMS. HARF: -- again, this is a very fluid situation, and things are happening every minute here, but before I came out, it was our understanding that she was still at the police station, which was where she was being held this morning D.C. time. Again, very fluid situation, so I can’t confirm these reports that she has been released. We are in communication with the Sudanese foreign ministry to ensure that she and her family will be free to travel as quickly as possible. Again, she had been detained while issues related to her travel and identification documents were sorted out. And from our perspective, Meriam has all of the documents she needs to travel to and enter the United States. It’s up to the Government of Sudan to allow her to exit the country. As I said, we’re working with them on that right now.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. “From our perspective?” Can you just – can you eliminate that and just say she has the travel – valid travel documents and --\n\nMS. HARF: Again, we’re working with the Government of Sudan on that.\n\nQUESTION: Can you – would – are you hopeful that she’ll be able to get out today?\n\nMS. HARF: We’re hopeful that she’ll be able to get out soon. I just don’t want to predict.\n\nQUESTION: And would you expect her destination, when she does leave, to be the United States?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, I don’t have anything specific, but as I just said, we – in terms of our perspective, she has the necessary documents she needs to travel to the United States.\n\nQUESTION: Does that mean she has a visa to enter the United States?\n\nMS. HARF: I don’t have more specifics for you on what documents – what those documents might look like.\n\nQUESTION: Why not? Just out of curiosity, why not?\n\nMS. HARF: Because we don’t always give out those specific details for a variety of reasons, some of which are privacy, some of which are bureaucratic. Just don’t always share those. But I gave you a new line today on travel documents.\n\nQUESTION: I did notice that.\n\nMS. HARF: (Laughter.)\n\nQUESTION: A new topic?\n\nMS. HARF: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: So the South Korean military today said that North Korea launched four projectiles into the Sea of Japan --\n\nMS. HARF: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: -- today. Does this raise concerns that North Korea’s increasing its provocations?\n\nMS. HARF: I think we’re always concerned whenever North Korea launches anything. I think that’s probably fair to say. And we are aware of, I think, three projectiles. Did you say three or four? I’m sorry.\n\nQUESTION: I believe it’s being reported as three.\n\nMS. HARF: Okay, right. So that North Korea launched three projectiles from its southeast coast. We’re monitoring the situation, and we’re still evaluating the available information to identify the exact type of projectile that may have been launched.\n\nQUESTION: And assuming that they did launch these projectiles, would this be a violation of UN resolutions?\n\nMS. HARF: It depends. It depends on what they were. Technically, obviously any launch of anything is problematic, is escalatory in nature, is threatening. So obviously, we wouldn’t agree with any launch, but in terms of the technicality, it depends on what they were.\n\nQUESTION: Israel?\n\nMS. HARF: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Quick question for --\n\nMS. HARF: Oh, yeah. Uh-huh?\n\nQUESTION: One more on North Korea. One question – I realize that North Korea has a very different system of freedom of speech and different ideas on that than the United States. But the North Koreans --\n\nMS. HARF: That’s the understatement of the day, I think. (Laughter.)\n\nQUESTION: The North Koreans called on the United States to ban the film, “The Interview.”\n\nMS. HARF: I was wondering why I didn’t get this yesterday. I was surprised.\n\nQUESTION: Do you have a response to that?\n\nQUESTION: Great film.\n\nMS. HARF: I really don’t. They, I think, had a fairly strong reaction to it, and really I think I’m going to steer clear of commenting on it, so --\n\nQUESTION: Do you see a connection between the movie and the projectile launch?\n\nMS. HARF: Not to my knowledge, but I’m happy to check. I just – I don’t think I have any analysis to do on that.\n\nQUESTION: A quick question --\n\nQUESTION: Are there any observations of why the North Koreans might be so upset about this? Does it show that more outside information is seeping in?\n\nMS. HARF: It’s a good question. I’m happy to check with our folks. I just don’t know the answer.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Quick question on Israel.\n\nMS. HARF: Uh-huh.\n\nQUESTION: Apparently, today Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman during his meeting with Secretary Kerry suggested that Israel would help moderate Arab countries to fight ISIL. Is this something that the United States would look kindly on, or would encourage Israel to do --\n\nMS. HARF: Well --\n\nQUESTION: -- or would advise against?\n\nMS. HARF: Just a quick little readout of that meeting. They talked about the long-term relationship between the Israelis and the Palestinians. They obviously talked about the missing Israeli teenagers, and the Secretary reiterated his concern over the missing teenagers. They also talked about Iraq and ISIL, as you mentioned, and they had really a discussion about the longer-term threat coming from some of these groups.\n\nAnd we welcome anyone in the region who is willing to stand up and help fight the threat that ISIL poses. Again, really when it comes to Iraq, though, this is a fight the Iraqis need to take on themselves through their army and through their capabilities.\n\nQUESTION: Well, how can you say that you welcome anyone in the region and then tell Assad that he can’t?\n\nMS. HARF: Assad – when you brutally massacre --\n\nQUESTION: Anyone but Assad?\n\nQUESTION: Anyone else?\n\nQUESTION: Anyone other than Assad is welcome to help, then?\n\nMS. HARF: Look, if Assad were to stop killing his own people, to stop using barrel bombs, to lay down his weapons and agree to a transitional governing body, sure. We can have that discussion. I’ll – I will wait for that to happen.\n\nYeah.\n\nQUESTION: Can I ask you --\n\nQUESTION: One question on Iraq.\n\nMS. HARF: Uh-huh.\n\nQUESTION: You said any help is welcome as long as it is not based on sectarian considerations.\n\nMS. HARF: Right. It needs to all be in the service of an inclusive government.\n\nQUESTION: Is any Iranian help – could it be anything else but sectarian?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, we judge actions by each one specifically. And again, I don’t have all the details on what may or may not be going on, but we know the history there. But again, I don’t have more details to share with you on what Iran is doing.\n\nYes.\n\nQUESTION: Another --\n\nMS. HARF: Go to you next.\n\nYeah.\n\nQUESTION: Madam, as far as security in South Asia is concerned, it depends on all stability in Pakistan. Innocent Pakistanis are being killed every day, and there is civil and political unrest going on in the country. And also now jihadists, al-Qaida and Talibans are now standing up against the innocent Pakistanis, that they will wage war against Pakistan if the military operation continues against them in Waziristan and all that.\n\nMy question is that India is also worried, and also because you have a strategic interest in next-door neighbor in Afghanistan. So how U.S. is helping, or has Pakistan asked for U.S. help?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, you asked a lot about a lot there, so let me just address a few quick points and then I’m going to Arshad next.\n\nLook, we’ve worked very closely with the Pakistanis. The threat from the Taliban and other terrorist groups is not new. We’ve worked with them very closely. It doesn’t just threaten the Pakistanis; it threatens Afghanistan and India, and has the United States in the past as well.\n\nIn terms of the current operations Pakistan is undertaking in North Waziristan, this is an entirely led – Pakistani-led and executed operation. Obviously, we have long supported their efforts to extend the writ of government throughout their country and to increase internal stability and security. But again, these are – these current operations are an entire Pakistani-led event.\n\nThank you. Arshad.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, just a quick one. Can you give us just a succinct, simple description of the main issues that you expect the Secretary and King Abdullah to discuss tomorrow?\n\nMS. HARF: Iraq, Syria. Clean and succinct enough for you?\n\nQUESTION: Oil?\n\nMS. HARF: I’m sure.\n\nQUESTION: Iran?\n\nMS. HARF: Yeah. I’m sure they will as well. So obviously, the ISIL threat in Iraq, how we’re working with the Iraqis on this, what the conversations the Secretary had in Iraq were like. When it comes to Syria, we’ve said we will continue increasing our support to the opposition. I think we’ll have conversations about that. Next week we start the next round of the P5+1 talks with Iran over its nuclear program. I’m sure there will be mention of that. Oil is always a topic of conversation, but I can’t predict whether it will come up, but frequently does.\n\nQUESTION: And lastly, would you expect, regardless of what the Secretary might say about this, that the issue of ISIL financing will come up?\n\nMS. HARF: I don’t know. I don’t want to predict. As I said, we don’t have any information that the government is – has supported from a funding perspective. We’ll see if it does. I don’t want to predict. Obviously, it’s something we’re worried about.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nMS. HARF: Yes. Last one.\n\nQUESTION: India.\n\nQUESTION: I’ve got two very brief ones.\n\nMS. HARF: Okay, okay. All right.\n\nQUESTION: India. Thank you.\n\nMS. HARF: You’re welcome.\n\nQUESTION: Madam, yesterday the Carnegie experts were discussing about the new government of Narendra Modi in India and the U.S.-India relations. What they were discussing was that India and the new government now needs a massive investment to go forward and move forward the country because the 60 years, corruption and all those things were going on.\n\nMy question is here: So many things going on between the two countries; official visits to India and all that. During these visits, have you been discussing about the massive investment in India?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, we’ve certainly – and I think this is what you’re asking about. We certainly talk quite a bit about the economic relationship with India, whether it’s investing in certain parts of its economy; whether it’s increasing exports and imports and private sector trade. That’s certainly been a key part of our discussions with the Government of India, not just since Mr. Modi has been in office, but before that for a long time as well.\n\nYeah – two, yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Making good --\n\nQUESTION: Staying on India.\n\nMS. HARF: Okay, stay on India.\n\nQUESTION: Oh.\n\nMS. HARF: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Today in Lahore, JUD chief Hafiz Saeed said that if U.S. can do whatever it wants, don’t care, they should prove if they have proof. And then the foreign – Pakistani foreign office spokesperson Tasnim Aslam said that Pakistan is not under any obligation, because it’s from U.S. and not from UN.\n\nMS. HARF: Are you referring to the --\n\nQUESTION: Yesterday’s --\n\nMS. HARF: Yesterday’s – well, the – or the designations that we’ve had on LET have been in place for some time now, for years. And yesterday what we did was add additional aliases to make sure that we can increasingly cut off the funding and support to LET through other – these other aliases that they use for their activities as well. And look, we’ve been very clear about the threat LET poses.\n\nQUESTION: I know, but --\n\nMS. HARF: And we have shared information from our assessment about the attack in Herat with the Indian Government.\n\nQUESTION: No, but --\n\nQUESTION: Marie, the UN has also imposed sanction on LET and Hafiz Saeed.\n\nMS. HARF: Yes. Yes.\n\nQUESTION: So Pakistan is under obligation to implement --\n\nMS. HARF: I’m happy to check with our UN team about those specifics.\n\nQUESTION: No, but when the foreign – foreign office spokesperson says that no obligation from the U.S., it’s a partner state. So what have you spoken --\n\nMS. HARF: Well, I haven’t seen those comments, and I don’t want to get into a tit-for-tat with my counterpart in Pakistan without seeing them. So let me check. Obviously, we’ve made very clear our concern about LET. That’s why we put them on our designation list; that’s why we try to cut off funding and support to them. Let me check on those comments, and I’m happy to see if there’s more to share.\n\nQUESTION: Oh, and if – I know – two very brief --\n\nMS. HARF: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: -- on Egypt. If there’s anything new on – in terms of contacts with the Egyptians about --\n\nMS. HARF: Nothing new. We’ve been in continual contact with them, but nothing new to highlight.\n\nQUESTION: And then --\n\nQUESTION: Any more deliveries? No deliveries of additional material?\n\nMS. HARF: No, nothing has changed there. No.\n\nQUESTION: And then, making good on my promise from yesterday, you have anything to say --\n\nMS. HARF: Uh-oh.\n\nQUESTION: -- about your position on the renaming of the street?\n\nMS. HARF: Excuse me. Okay.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah?\n\nMS. HARF: So let’s see. Well, much to your dismay, I am not going to take a position on the naming of the street. But I will say a few things about this gentleman. The Secretary put out a statement – I believe it was December 9th, 2013 – marking the 5th anniversary of this Nobel laureate and writer’s detention; have called very clearly for his release from the Chinese authorities, to end his wife’s house arrest, and to guarantee him and his family members all internationally-recognized human rights protections and freedoms.\n\nSo clearly, we think this gentleman has played an important role in advancing dialogue. And I think we’ll probably leave it at that.\n\nQUESTION: Which gentleman? Which --\n\nMS. HARF: So the person they want to name the street after – you want me to try and pronounce it? Is that what you’re trying to get me to do?\n\nQUESTION: I’m just trying to – I’m wondering if you’re not willing to say the name.\n\nMS. HARF: No, I – oh, no, no, no. I just didn’t want to mispronounce it.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Oh, okay. Okay, that --\n\nMS. HARF: It’s Liu Xiaobo.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah.\n\nMS. HARF: So --\n\nQUESTION: So --\n\nMS. HARF: My pronunciations aren’t always the best, though, so --\n\nQUESTION: I didn’t --\n\nMS. HARF: So in general, what I’m saying is, look, I’m not taking a position on the legislation. Clearly, we think that he – this person has been a voice, should be released from prison. His wife’s house arrest should end – making very clear our feelings on him. I don’t want that to be caught up in the confusion of the fact that we won’t take a position on this legislation.\n\nQUESTION: So you won’t take a position on the legislation?\n\nMS. HARF: I will not from here at this time, no.\n\nQUESTION: But the Administration will and has?\n\nMS. HARF: Publicly, we’re not taking a position on it at this time.\n\nQUESTION: Well, it – will there come a time when you --\n\nMS. HARF: There may.\n\nQUESTION: -- will take a public – given the fact that this street is --\n\nMS. HARF: There may. Often, as you know, with legislation we don’t take positions for some time, and then we eventually do.\n\nQUESTION: Right. But given the fact that this is – this street is under federal – it’s the federal government’s street --\n\nMS. HARF: Mm-hmm.\n\nQUESTION: -- and you have jurisdiction over it, I would think that you would have an interest in – an interest that shouldn’t – there’s no reason for it to be a private position.\n\nMS. HARF: Well, we’re having those conversations with Congress. Again, I’m happy to take your advice about the fact that we should make those public back to them.\n\nQUESTION: So you believe that this guy should be released --\n\nMS. HARF: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: -- but you’re not – but you won’t say whether you think he should be – whether it’s appropriate to --\n\nMS. HARF: For a street to be named after him, yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Any street anywhere?\n\nMS. HARF: I don’t think I have any more on this street.\n\nQUESTION: I mean, look --\n\nQUESTION: So it sounds like you don’t support.\n\nMS. HARF: That’s not what I said. I did not at all say that.\n\nQUESTION: Well, if you’re questioning the appropriateness of a street being named after him --\n\nMS. HARF: I didn’t say that. I didn’t question it. I said I’m taking no position on whether or not this street should be named after him at all.\n\nQUESTION: So do you know if the Chinese have made their public complaint to you guys in private?\n\nMS. HARF: I can check. I don’t know.\n\nQUESTION: Well, without taking a position on the legislation, do you think that such a move could aggravate your relationship with the Chinese?\n\nMS. HARF: Well, I think by definition that would mean I was taking a position on the legislation if I did any analysis on it. So as I said, we think we’ve made very clear that he should be released. We’ve made very clear that we think he’s played an important role in advancing dialogue in China, but again, nothing – no position on the proposed legislation.\n\nQUESTION: I think we’ll take that as a “No.”\n\nQUESTION: Right, but either the Administration thinks that it’s --\n\nMS. HARF: I think you can assume what you want, but you might be wrong.\n\nQUESTION: The – I don’t understand this at all. The Administration either thinks it’s a good idea or an appropriate idea to honor him with – by renaming the street in front of the embassy or it thinks it is not appropriate or it takes no position. You say --\n\nMS. HARF: I said publicly we are not taking a position, which happens all the time with proposed legislation. All the time, Matt. This is not breaking news.\n\nQUESTION: Forget about the --\n\nQUESTION: Well, it isn’t all the time because sometimes you take a very public position on legislation.\n\nMS. HARF: Actually, it – much more often, we don’t take a position than we do. Much more often. It is the – actually the exception to the rule that we will take a position on pending legislation.\n\nQUESTION: Marie, do you know who owns the street in front of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing?\n\nMS. HARF: I don’t.\n\nQUESTION: Do you know who owns the street in front of the Chinese embassy in Washington?\n\nMS. HARF: As you noted, I think it’s been widely reported that it is the property of the federal government.\n\nQUESTION: Would you object to the Chinese – if it is that the Chinese who own the street in front of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, would you object to them doing the same thing?\n\nMS. HARF: I am not even going to entertain that hypothetical.\n\nQUESTION: Really? If the Chinese decided they wanted to come out and rename the street in front of the --\n\nQUESTION: Edward Snowden Way. (Laughter.)\n\nQUESTION: -- Edward Snowden Avenue or --\n\nQUESTION: Benedict Arnold Boulevard? (Laughter.)\n\nMS. HARF: I’d be happy to have that conversation.\n\nQUESTION: -- or something like that?\n\nQUESTION: Robert Hanson Way. (Laughter.)\n\nMS. HARF: I’m sure the Chinese Government is taking all of your suggestions on board right now.\n\nQUESTION: I’m sure that they had them – they were in their minds before.\n\nMS. HARF: We’re just not, at this point, look, going to take a public position on this.\n\nQUESTION: I just can’t see how it’s helpful to your diplomacy with the Chinese not to take a position.\n\nMS. HARF: I will take your advice on board, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: All right. Let’s go watch the soccer game.\n\nQUESTION: Game time?\n\nMS. HARF: Yes, thank you.\n\nQUESTION: Game time.\n\nMS. HARF: Yes, thank you. And you saw the note. We’re going to – in case people want, we’re going to have it on the big screens here --\n\nQUESTION: Well, can we ask you about your attire today?\n\nMS. HARF: -- so people can watch the game. Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: She’s ready.\n\nQUESTION: Well, tell us about why you --\n\nMS. HARF: About my Team USA shirt?\n\nQUESTION: Well, tell us about why you’re not in your regular professional garb.\n\nMS. HARF: (Laughter.) This isn’t professional? Look, all joking aside, we’ve talked a lot about the fact that, look, I get – we stand up here and represent the United States and the World Cup is a huge international event, and it’s all about sports diplomacy and bringing people together. And where else can you get all these countries in one place to do something that’s positive, right? And that’s kind of amazing. And I’ve become a pretty big fan, so I think – thank you for giving the pleasure of briefing early today.\n\nQUESTION: There is a potential that the results of today’s matches could result in the United States playing Russia --\n\nMS. HARF: Well, there you go. (Inaudible.)\n\nQUESTION: -- in the next round. (Laughter.) Would you like to comment on that probability or is that a hypothetical question at the moment that you do not --\n\nMS. HARF: It is a – but I do think it’s cool, when we’re at the P5+1s, I mean, the one thing that brings people together often is sports, and is soccer, and is the World Cup. And what better way to talk about something positive than for me to wear my Team USA colors. And I’m surprised Matt’s not wearing a scarf today.\n\nQUESTION: It’s too hot.\n\nMS. HARF: I know. Anyway, if you guys want to stay, we’re going to show the games up – the game up here. So grab a soda and lunch and come back, and thanks for coming to today’s briefing.\n\nDPB #113",

precision guided missiles yonhap by kang seungwoo north korea said friday that it had testfired three newly developed tactical guided missiles into the sea off its east coast thursday according to the korean central news agency kcna it successfully launched cuttingedge ultraprecision tactical guided missiles and north korean leader kim jongun supervised the test the testfiring clearly proved that the tactical guided weapons did not have an inch of deviation in their scientific and technological performance the kcna said this has helped the korean peoples army get the master key to putting all strike means including short medium and longrange guided weapons on an ultraprecision basis at a world level and opened the prospect for maximizing their striking accuracy and power south koreas joint chiefs of staff jsc speculated that the projectiles were launched from the norths new multiple rocket launcher better known as kn09 firing 300milimeter rockets with a maximum range of about 160 kilometers it is seen as a testfire to extend its range further a jsc official said as the kn09 can fire several missiles in short succession the launcher is seen as a serious threat to south korean and us troops including us bases in pyeongtaek and osan located some 160 kilometers from the demilitarized zone the us government made clear its position on the norths launches were monitoring the situation and were still evaluating the available information to identify the exact type of projectile that may have been launched state department spokeswoman marie harf said in a briefing obviously any launch of anything is problematic is escalatory in nature is threatening so obviously we wouldnt agree with any launch the north has taken an exceptional path by making public its weapons systems last week the north released a picture of kim inspecting a submarine followed by fridays announcement of the guided missile test yang uk a senior research fellow at the korea defense and security forum said the north is using a coercive strategy the strategy is aimed at showing off the norths military capability while affecting the souths hardline policy toward it he said from the start of the year the north has launched a total of 93 missiles and rockets including two midrange rodong missiles it drew condemnation from the united nations security council that sanctioned the north for conducting nuclear tests and any launches using ballistic missile technology according to a 2009 resolution incensed by the criticism the north threatened to conduct a new type of nuclear test in

            "text": "Posted : 2014-06-27 15:40 Updated : 2014-06-27 19:17 NK test-fires 'new' missile \n\n\n\n North Korea said Friday that it had test-fired three newly developed \"tactical guided missiles\" into the sea off its east coast Thursday. \n\n\n\n According to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), it successfully launched \"cutting-edge ultra-precision tactical guided missiles,\" and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un supervised the test. \n\n\n\n \"The test-firing clearly proved that the tactical guided weapons did not have an inch of deviation in their scientific and technological performance,\" the KCNA said. \n\n\n\n \"This has helped the Korean People's Army get the master key to putting all strike means including short- medium- and long-range guided weapons on an ultra-precision basis at a world level and opened the prospect for maximizing their striking accuracy and power.\" \n\n\n\n South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JSC) speculated that the projectiles were launched from the North's new multiple rocket launcher, better known as KN-09 firing 300-milimeter rockets with a maximum range of about 160 kilometers. \n\n\n\n \"It is seen as a test-fire to extend its range further,\" a JSC official said. \n\n\n\n As the KN-09 can fire several missiles in short succession, the launcher is seen as a serious threat to South Korean and U.S. troops, including U.S. bases in Pyeongtaek and Osan, located some 160 kilometers from the demilitarized zone. \n\n\n\n The U.S. government made clear its position on the North's launches. \n\n\n\n \"We're monitoring the situation, and we're still evaluating the available information to identify the exact type of projectile that may have been launched,\" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a briefing. \n\n\n\n \"Obviously any launch of anything is problematic, is escalatory in nature, is threatening. So obviously, we wouldn't agree with any launch.\" \n\n\n\n The North has taken an exceptional path by making public its weapons systems. \n\n\n\n Last week, the North released a picture of Kim inspecting a submarine, followed by Friday's announcement of the guided missile test. \n\n\n\n Yang Uk, a senior research fellow at the Korea Defense and Security Forum, said the North is using a coercive strategy. \n\n\n\n \"The strategy is aimed at showing off the North's military capability, while affecting the South's hard-line policy toward it,\" he said. \n\n\n\n From the start of the year, the North has launched a total of 93 missiles and rockets, including two mid-range Rodong missiles. It drew condemnation from the United Nations Security Council that sanctioned the North for conducting nuclear tests and any launches using ballistic missile technology according to a 2009 resolution. Incensed by the criticism, the North threatened to conduct a new type of nuclear test in March. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n 1. Woman caught having sex with dogs, tries to poison owner 2.

What we are waiting for is only the order to be given by the Supreme Command to strike the provocateurs,\" it added.\n\nSouth Korea's Marine Corps carried out a live-fire drill for a second straight day on Thursday near the country's five border islands in the Yellow Sea, including Yeonpyeong and Baengnyeong.\n\n\"The naval drills yesterday and today are regular ones, and we did not fire in a northern direction, but in a southwestern direction. It is absurd to say that the South encroached on North Korean territorial waters,\" a military officer said.\n\nIn May, Pyongyang fired two shells into waters near a South Korean warship on patrol south of the maritime border in the Yellow Sea, prompting the patrol boat to return fire. No casualties or property damage were reported.\n\nHours before issuing the statement Thursday, the North fired three short-range rockets from its east coast. The North's media has not made comment on the firing.\n\n<All rights reserved by Yonhap News Agency>",

            "text": "SEOUL, South Korea: North Korea said on Friday that leader Kim Jong-un has guided the test launches of its newly developed precision guided missiles, in a possible reference to three short-range projectiles South Korean officials say the North fired toward its waters a day earlier.\n\nSouth Korean defence officials said the projectiles fired from an eastern port city on Thursday flew about 190 kilometres (120 miles) before harmlessly landing into the waters off its east coast. The exact type of those projectiles and the North's intentions weren't immediately known.The North's state media on Friday said that the country tested what it calls \"cutting-edge ultra-precision tactical guided missiles\" and Kim watched the tests with top deputies and was satisfied with the results.There is virtually no way to independently confirm whether North Korea has developed such high-tech missiles. North Korea has frequently bluffed and exaggerated about its military capability, and its army, though one of the world's largest, is seen as running on outdated equipment and short supplies amid the nation's chronic economic problems, according to foreign analysts.Still, the impoverished North devotes much of its scarce resources to its missile and nuclear programs, which subsequently pose a serious threat to South Korea, Japan and tens of thousands of US troops in the region. Outside analysts say North Korea has developed a handful of crude nuclear devices and is working toward building a warhead small enough to mount on a long-range missile, although most experts say that goal may take years to achieve.The North didn't say when the latest launches took place or how many missiles were fired, but they are likely the projectiles that Seoul says North Korea fired on Thursday as there have been no other such reported firings by North Korea in recent days.South Korean defence ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said that North Korea has been trying to upgrade its large-calibre multiple rocket launch systems in recent years and that those weapons' range has been slightly and gradually increased in each test-launch.The North Korean media dispatch on Friday called the latest missile launches \"significant\" because they were made at a time when it is bolstering its national defence because the US and South Korea are \"going extremely reckless in the moves to isolate and stifle (North Korea) and unleash a war of aggression\".Short-range test firings by North Korea aren't unusual, but a barrage of missile and artillery tests earlier this year boosted tension between the rivals. A North Korean artillery attack in 2010 killed four South Koreans on a front-line Yellow Sea island.North Korea has, in recent months, threatened South Korea's president, calling her a prostitute, and the South has vowed to hit North Korea hard if provoked. North Korea's rising anger coincided with annual joint military exercises by the US and South Korea and a visit to Seoul by President Barack Obama. North Korea also test-fired two medium-range ballistic missiles and exchanged artillery fire with South Korea near a disputed boundary in the Yellow Sea.On Thursday, North Korea's army accused South Korea of firing shells into the North's waters near the sea boundary. The North Korean army in the front-line area is \"full of the strong will of retaliation to punish the provocateurs to the last one by giving vent to their pent-up grudge,\" said the army statement carried by Pyongyang's Korean Central News Agency.Both Koreas routinely conduct artillery drills near the maritime boundary, a scene of several bloody skirmishes in recent years.The Korean Peninsula is still technically in a state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice and not a peace treaty. The United States keeps about 28,500 troops in the South.",

            "text": "SEOUL--North Korea's highest-profile leadership purge since Kim Jong Un took power two years ago is being widely seen as a power-consolidation move but could trigger instability if it upsets the balance between the two major power centers: the military and the ruling party.\n\nOn Monday, North Korean state television showed Mr. Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, being dragged out of a meeting by security officials, reinforcing the unusually public downfall of the de facto No. 2 in the regime.\n\nMr. Jang and his associates were accused of a litany of \"anti-state\" crimes, ranging from corruption to womanizing and drug-taking, by a meeting of officials from the central committee of North Korea's Workers' Party on Sunday. The report was carried on the front page of North Korea's main newspaper, with a large photo of Mr. Kim chairing the meeting.\n\nMr. Jang's fate is unknown. One report from a radio station in Seoul run by North Korean defectors said he had already been executed. South Korean intelligence officials believe some of Mr. Jang's aides have been killed.\n\nThe removal of Mr. Jang marks the boldest purge by Mr. Kim since taking power at the end of 2011. But as much as the disposal of a figure like Mr. Jang--a man widely believed to have acted as a regent for the 30-something Mr. Kim--surprised North Korea watchers, so did the stage-managed show to convict him in front of senior members of the ruling party.\n\nAnalysts said it may be an effort by Mr. Kim to exert power over the party following a succession of purges to rein in the military. Last year Mr. Kim removed Ri Yong Ho as chief of the general staff of the Korean People's Army, and since then he has cycled through three top generals. Mr. Jang, who has represented North Korea in economic talks with Chinese leaders, is most commonly associated with the party even though he has military titles.\n\nPolitical purges are in the DNA for Mr. Kim. His grandfather and North Korea's first ruler, Kim Il Sung, periodically ousted entire political factions that either posed a threat or disagreed with his views, starting from the late 1950s. Under Kim Jong Il, senior North Korean officials were killed or ousted as scapegoats for policy failure.\n\nWhile some argue that the younger Mr. Kim's succession of purges--he's culled close to half of the top military leaders and other officials who served under his father--show he is effectively consolidating power, others express concern about whether he will be able to manage the balance of competing interests under his charge.\n\nExperts note that a difficult balancing act between the military and the party is at the core of North Korea policy. Shortly after his ascent to power, Mr. Kim's regime adopted an ideology known as byungjin that simultaneously prioritizes economic development and nuclear weapons, which North Korea continues to call its nonnegotiable \"treasured sword.\"\n\nMismatched policies and dueling factions could unsettle the regime, some analysts warn.\n\n\"The biggest danger to the regime remains from within,\" said Scott Snyder, Washington-based director of the Program on U.S.-Korea Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"It could be that the steps that Kim Jong Un is taking are steps that are potentially corrosive, rather than consolidationist.\"\n\nMr. Kim's decision to remove Mr. Ri last year and Mr. Jang this year \"constitute signs of internal churn and serious infighting, not a smooth transition,\" said Victor Cha, a former U.S. official and specialist on North Korea at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n\nThe danger, from a U.S. perspective, is that the regime may seek to address any lack of control with more aggressive behavior outside its boundaries, Mr. Cha said. The new array of senior military figures following Mr. Kim's purges may also be emboldened by the removal of Mr. Jang, sensing a power shift back to the armed forces.\n\nSouth Korean officials have expressed concerns about possible instability and military provocations by North Korea following the leadership purge. On Monday the defense ministry said there had been no signs of unusual activity or movements by the North Korean military but added it was monitoring closely.\n\nJeyup S.

            "text": "North Korea announced Friday the successful test of a new high-precision, tactical guided missile, as its army threatened a \"devastating\" retaliation against South Korea for carrying out live fire drills near their maritime border.\n\nThe launch of the \"cutting-edge\" missile was watched by North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, according to the North's official KCNA news agency, which hailed the test as a \"breakthrough\" in national defence capability.\n\nNorth Korea is not known to have a tactical guided missile, but analysis of a recent propaganda film suggested it may have acquired a variant of a Russian cruise missile, the KH-35.\n\nKCNA did not specify the timing of the test, but it appeared to coincide with the firing on Thursday of what South Korea described as three short-range projectiles into the Sea of Japan (East Sea).\n\nThe Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North's ruling party, published pictures Friday of the new missile being tested with Kim in attendance.\n\nKim reportedly stressed the weapon's importance in providing a credible \"pre-emptive\" strike capability.\n\nSouth Korea's defence ministry related the latest test to Pyongyang's efforts to improve its large-calibre multiple rocket launching (MRL) systems.\n\n\"The MRL ranges have been extended and guidance capabilities added to the projectiles,\" spokesman Kim Min-Seok said.\n\nWashington said it was looking into the technical specifics to determine the threat level.\n\n\"Technically, obviously any launch of anything is problematic, is escalatory in nature, is threatening,\" said US State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf.\n\nOn Thursday, the Korean People's Army (KPA) released a statement on KCNA condemning recent South Korean live fire exercises near their disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea.\n\nA 'devastating strike'\n\nThe statement described the drills as a \"reckless provocation\" and warned that frontline KPA units had rounded off preparations for a \"devastating strike\" in retaliation.\n\n\"All they are waiting for is the order to be given by the Supreme Command,\" it said.\n\nThe South's defence ministry declined to confirm that any particular drills had taken place, but said routine exercises in the area of the maritime border were common.\n\nSome analysts have suggested that North Korea might seek to raise tensions ahead of an expected visit to South Korea next week by Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nBut others said Friday's announcement was simply aimed at talking up the North's military capabilities as the international community seeks ways to curb Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme.\n\nKCNA said the test was carried out at a time when \"attempts to isolate and suffocate us and provocations to start a war of aggression by the US and its puppets are reaching a new height\".\n\nYun Duk-Min, a professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul, said the development of a tactical guided missile would be an \"obvious military hazard\" to South Korea and the US bases it hosts.\n\nA precision weapon would also be a response to South Korea's hyped development of an indigenous cruise missile that was displayed during a military parade in Seoul last October.\n\nAccording to the South's defence ministry, the Hyeonmu 3's accuracy made it capable of striking the \"office window\" of the North's command headquarters in Pyongyang.\n\nInter-Korean relations have been tense for some months following annual South Korea-US military exercises that Pyongyang regularly condemns as provocative rehearsals for invasion.\n\nBefore the new missile test, there had been hopes that the atmosphere was calming as the two sides held their first talks for six months on running their joint industrial zone in Kaesong.\n\nBecause the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a ceasefire rather than a peace treaty, the two Koreas remain technically at war.\n\n© 2014 AFP",

welcome any syrian strike because this group targets both iraq and syria but we didnt make any request from syria they carry out their strikes and we carry out ours the final winners are our two countries he said in the bbc interview top britain can not educate the world says high court judge appeal court judges reject a bid by a filipino family to stay in britain so that their children can get a good education telegraph 26th june 2014 britain can not educate the world a senior judge said as he rejected a bid by a filipino family living in kent to stay in the country so their children could recieve a good education the familyoffive were challenging a ruling denying them indefinite leave to remain in the uk on the basis that it would be best for the three children but lord justice lewison and two senior colleagues said the best thing for them would be to stay with their parents who have no right to stay in the country i can not see that the desirability of being educated at public expense in the uk can outweigh the benefit to the children of remaining with their parents he said just as we can not provide medical treatment for the world so we can not educate the world the appeal court was rejecting a challenge by the mother to a decision by the home office immigration authorities upheld by immigration tribunal judges not to renew her familys permission to remain after her work permit ran out lawyers for the care home nurse who for legal reasons can only be referred to as ev launched a lastditch argument that the best interests of her children and their education in the uk ranked above all immigration control considerations they contended it would not be proportionate to send them back to the philippines but would breach article 8 of the european convention on human rights which safeguards the right to private and family life rejecting the argument lord justice lewison said in the real world parents relied on the bests interests of their children in order to piggyback on their rights in evs case the mother had no right to remain in the uk and the interests of the family members had to be considered in the light of the real world facts the judge said in our case none of the family is a british citizen none has a right to remain in this country if the parents are removed then it is entirely reasonable to expect the children to go with them the judge also observed that the immigration judge whose decision the court was upholding had weighed the best interests of the children without explicitly considering the cost to the public purse in providing education to these children he said the courts had ruled that the cost would have been an appropriate consideration if anything therefore the immigration judge adopted an approach too favourable to the appellant lord justice clarke said ev was a skilled care worker who entered the uk with a work permit and was given permission to stay until february 2011 she worked at a care home in kent and was joined by her husband bv in april 2008 and then by the couples three children a daughter now aged 15 a son aged 12 and daughter aged nine in july 2009 evs application for indefinite leave to remain was rejected by the home office immigration authorities leading to a complex series of legal challenges involving the first tier immigration tribunal and the upper tribunal after losing her case against removal before both tribunals the mother was given permission to test in the appeal court whether her childrens rights not to have their education disrupted should take precedence lord justice clarke said evs job did not involve the requisite level of skill and she was not earning enough to be allowed to remain in the country under the immigration rules an immigration tribunal judge had accepted she had been defrauded and underpaid by the care home owner who employed her she had not at first informed the home office authorities of this but the issue had now been taken into consideration and she was still being refused permission to remain lord justice clarke said the question for the appeal court was whether it would be proportionate to remove the children as they had received an excellent report from the deputy head of their school in kent all family members had formed friendships in their local community and it was in the best interests of the children that their education was not disrupted but said the judge the education system in the philippines was sufficiently good ev herself had obtained an msc degree in nursing there and the childrens interests did not outweigh the need for immigration control ev and her husband would be employable in the philippines the family which had only been in the uk for a limited time would also have access to an extended family and not be homeless the children would not be without education in the philippines although it would not be as good as in the uk and secondary education was not free in that country top poor white pupils need extra help with english richard garner independent 27th june 2014 schoolchildren from white workingclass homes should be entitled to the same kind of remedial language support as pupils who have english as a second language because without extra help they are falling behind their foreignspeaking classmates research has found some workingclass children are arriving at school unable to recognise their own names and need just as much help to allow them to communicate with their peers a conference will be told today members of staff felt that the school grants needed to be rethought as there is currently no money to support the language deficit within the white workingclass community argues the study by dr feyisa demie head of research and statistics at lambeth council and dr kirstin lewis from goldsmiths college it said school ethnic minority achievement coordinators had found many students with english as a second language are articulate by the time they reach year 6 the last year in primary school due to the level of support they have had furthermore many schools reflected on the fact that pupils with english as an additional language eal needs arriving new to a school receive a thorough induction process it added but when it came to white workingclass pupils the coordinators said their hands were tied and that as much as some white workingclass pupils needed specific language support to progress and access the curriculum they were not in a position to give this support one told researchers i was with some children the other day in a classroom – it was the eal children who had the necessary comparative language bigger biggest the white children did not have the vocabulary the report added governors believe the current system of additional funding means some schools serving white workingclass estates do not receive adequate financial support the consequences of an ability to express oneself either verbally or in writing can lead to low selfesteem and often aggression one primary school teacher said many of the white children as do others come into school well below average they havent got the skills they cant recognise their own name the report is due to be presented at a conference at london universitys institute for education today it confirmed the findings of a commons select committee on education report last week in which mps revealed that white workingclass pupils were the poorest performers of any ethnic group in exams and tests professor alan smithers head of the centre for education and employment at buckingham university said we tend to provide very good tuition for students who come from abroad there is a whole profession build up around english as a second language but really english is to some extent a second language to a lot of young people born in this country one of the ways of raising the performance of white workingclass pupils is to give them help as if english was a foreign language in contrast to todays findings black pupils are now the fastest improving ethnic group after years languishing as the poorest performers as the independent revealed yesterday dr tony sewell who founded the charity generating genius – set up to help disadvantaged black youths but now widened in scope to cover white workingclass pupils as well – said a child from a west african background that is lower middleclass might better be able to access english than a white workingclass boy on an estate todays report also concluded that social deprivation and housing conditions play their part in limiting the achievements of whiteworking class pupils one of the main reasons for pupil underachievement is a perceived lack of aspiration amongst parents for their childrens future and a lack of engagement in their schooling it said one headteacher told the authors many of our parents are young with a legacy of hostility to school another teacher added that white workingclass parents did not possess the immigrant mentality the report concluded that the main obstacle in raising achievement is the governments failure to recognise that this group has particular needs that are not being met by the school system however the government argues that – with its pupil premium giving schools extra cash to take in disadvantaged pupils – schools now have the wherewithal to deal with underperformance top isis execution site revealed by satellite images claims human rights group grisly photos and satellite images provide evidence of horrible war crime in which at least 160 died says human rights watch the guardian 27th june 2014 iraqi insurgents executed at least 160 captives earlier this month in the northern city of tikrit human rights watch has said citing an analysis of satellite imagery and grisly photosgraphs released by the militants the usbased group said militants from the islamic state of iraq and the levant isis killed between 160 and 190 men in two locations in tikrit between 1114 june the number of victims may well be much higher but the difficulty of locating bodies and accessing the area has prevented a full investigation it said after overrunning large swaths of northern iraq and capturing the cities of mosul and tikrit earlier this month the islamic extremist group posted graphic photos on a militant website that appeared to show fighters loading dozens of captured soldiers on to flatbed trucks before forcing them to lie in a shallow ditch with their hands tied behind their backs a final set of photos shows what appear to be dead bodies the photos and satellite images from tikrit provide strong evidence of a horrible war crime that needs further investigation peter bouckaert emergencies director at human rights watch said in a statement the militants apparently executed at the very least 160 people in tikrit chief iraqi military spokesman lt gen qassim almoussawi confirmed the photos authenticity after they surfaced on 15 june and said he was aware of cases of mass murder of captured iraqi soldiers in areas held by isis he said at the time that an examination of the images by military experts showed that about 170 soldiers were shot to death by the militants after their capture captions on the photos showing the soldiers after they were shot say hundreds have been liquidated but the total could not immediately

as the younger producers wanted to change the world hannah furness telegraph 26th june 2014 the bbcs flagship politics programme newsnight is made by 13yearolds its former host jeremy paxman has said as he suggests his conservative leanings made him a lone voice on the show paxman who made his last appearance on the flagship bbc programme earlier this month said the makers of the programme were still young idealists wanting to change the world he added his experience in politics had led him to be a onenation tory with youthful idealism being a fools errand speaking at the chalke valley history festival about his book on the first world war he answered questions from the audience about his memorable tandem bike ride through the streets of london with boris johnson which featured on the final programme footage broadcast on newsnight saw the mayor of london call paxman the last onenation tory working at the bbc i have to be frank i suppose i am a onenation tory yes paxman admitted look newsnight is made by 13yearolds its perfectly normal when youre young that you want to change the world the older you get the more you realise what a fools errand much of that is and that the thing to do is to manage the best you can to the advantage of as many people as possible paxman who has had to be politically impartial throughout his journalism career added of the interview its complete bs of course typical boris on the question of whether he truly was the last conservative at the bbc he began to answer before stopping himself if i had toare there any members of the press here he said at the soldout event i think ill plead the fifth on that one his comments may be viewed by critics of the bbc as giving an insight into recent years at newsnight which has been plagued by mistakes made during the savile scandal and accusations of dumbing down paxmans latter encounters include an interview with comedian russell brand while his colleague kirsty wark performed a dance to michael jacksons thriller and emily maitlis interviewed the cookie monster its new editor ian katz joined from the guardian newspaper a year ago the public event also saw paxman share his opinion of modern politics saying i am in favour of governments getting out of peoples lives particularly foreign government the closer you can take decisionmaking to the people affected by those decisions the better europe he said had been the source of nothing but trouble for us and joked belgium as a pointless little country when asked if he had relaxed his rule about never drinking before a show for his final appearance he said no i didnt have a drink beforehand but perhaps i should have done paxman who spent 25 years working on newsnight will continue to work for the bbc as the presenter of

are put on display and made available for purchase in central shopping malls michael malay aje 27th june 2014 go to the bukit timah shopping centre a 1970s mall in central singapore and you will find five levels of brightly lit rooms and galleries called homekeeper and budget maid inside these rooms dozens of women sit in a listless artificial silence they nod respectfully as you enter and some watch closely as you speak to staff you might take one home with you for two years or longer the women domestic workers come from indonesia the philippines and myanmar they sit beneath garish signs and posters testifying to their friendliness and industriousness or advertising super promo rates and special discounts some maid agencies as theyre known locally display women at work along one aisle domestic workers push each other around in wheelchairs as though theyre taking care of the elderly in another gallery a woman cradles a baby doll and pretends to change its diapers others stand in mock living rooms ironing the same shirt or making the same bed scenes enacted elsewhere in singapore at malls like katong shopping centre on mountbatten road jolovan wham executive director of the humanitarian organisation of migration economics home a migrant workers advocacy group based in singapore said that some agencies market their domestic workers like commodities he adds that racial stereotypes are sometimes used in transactions with patrons some of the stereotypes include filipinos as smarter indonesians as less bright and burmese as sweetnatured and compliant there have also been complaints of women being underfed at certain employment agencies according to ummai ummairoh president of the indonesian family network ifn we always receive calls about agencies not giving enough food in one case an agency was spending 20 to feed 40 people ummairoh who also worked as a maid added that the shopping centres made women look like dolls at a supermarket for anandha nurul a domestic worker who spent seven years in singapore her time at the shopping malls was marked by boredom and long hours they did not treat me very nicely she said recalling that she was fed instant noodles for the three days she was at her agency we didnt even boil the noodles properly we just used warm water but standards vary considerably within the industry and other agencies claim to afford female domestic workers more dignified conditions we should be fair and treat these workers as human beings said dawn sng of primechoice maid agency who claims that her agency provides domestic workers with inhouse training free meals and counselling we should not put them into a lower category of people a multimillion dollar industry bukit timah and other shopping centres like it are the culmination of networks and organisations extending from singapore to various parts of southeast asia from brokers who recruit women from poor countries to training centres that prepare women for life abroad to runners who ferry domestic workers from airports to shopping centres and finally to the employment agencies themselves of which there are hundreds in singapore competing in what is effectively a multimillion dollar industry wham says that there are currently 215000 domestic workers in singapore we have continually advocated that the livein requirement is unsatisfactory because it easily leads to abuse shelley thio transient workers count too for most women according to wham the shopping centres are fleeting experiences that last no longer than a week before coming to singapore most domestic workers have already found their employers after a phone or webcam interview from their home countries the malls are essentially transition points and the women are soon sent to their employers after completing a settlingin programme and a mandatory heath check but some maids return to the malls and can end up staying there for as long as a month in the language of employment agencies these women are transfer maids and have either been released by their original employers or have requested to leave after experiencing problems at work shelley thio executive member of transient workers count too twc2 attributes most problems to working conditions and cites verbal abuse nonpayment of wages and excessive work hours as among the most common reasons domestic workers request formal transfers thio also raised concerns over singapores livein requirement by which a fulltime domestic worker is legally obliged to live in the home of her employer we have continually advocated that the livein requirement is unsatisfactory because it easily leads to abuse thio said adding that some women become vulnerable because of the removal of mobile phones which isolates them from friends and organisations such as home and twc2 the livein requirement can leave women vulnerable to sexual abuse earlier this year a cambodian domestic worker was sexually harassed by her employers father with whom she was made to share a room although the woman had complained about this arrangement both to her employers and employment agency nothing was done to change her situation prior to the abuse poor monitoring and high debts problems in singapore are sometimes compounded by unscrupulous practises and weak oversight in the female workers underdeveloped home countries in indonesian training centres for instance women commonly complain that dormitories are overcrowded and that they are not given enough food according to wahyu susilo of the advocacy group migrant care we are always finding migrant workers in cramped rooms and living with poor sanitary conditions in one case we found 200 migrant workers sharing two or three toilets he adds that monitoring by the indonesian government is generally weak which has led to exploitative conditions at a number of centres including unreasonable fees and deceptive recruitment practises in some cases monitoring of training centres in originating countries is limited due to corruption according to the managing director of one centre in indonesia who spoke to al jazeera on the condition of anonymity local police accept bribes from the training centres they are tasked with inspecting most domestic workers who come to singapore have large debts in the form of placement fees paid to agencies as monthly salary deductions thio at twc2 said that she has come across instances where domestic workers end up owing 4500 to their agencies adding that the average debts women accumulate are between 2500 and 3000 high placement fees are charged to the worker because the agencies can get away with it according to wham who said that some agencies disguise these fees as loans the worker pays these fees because she feels that she doesnt have a choice and our laws do not make it mandatory for employers to bear the bulk of the fees some domestic maids also work in singapore illegally a number of women are employed even though they are underage according to thio and some will be brought into the country under conditions indicative of trafficking but at shopping centres where clients stroll past homekeeper and budget maid and where domestic workers continue their unending simulation of household work little of this is expressed or known i watched all those things recounts istiana an indonesian domestic worker who has recently come to work in singapore those signs that say cheap price and discount maid but these are people she added top global warming study ridiculed after temperatures drop nick hallett breitbart news network 26th june 2014 a uk met office study that predicted temperatures would rise by up to half a degree centigrade over the past 10 years faces ridicule after it was revealed that temperatures actually dropped over that period the peerreviewed study by doug m smith et al entitled improved surface temperature prediction for the coming decade from a global climate model – and which featured in the journal science – also incorrectly predicted that several years over the past decade would see record heat the paper says predict further warming during the coming decade with the year 2014 predicted to be 030° ± 021°c 5 to 95 confidence interval ci warmer than the observed value for 2004 furthermore at least half of the years after 2009 are predicted to be warmer than 1998 the warmest year currently on record however now we are able to analyse the data on how temperatures really changed we can see that there was actually a cooling of 0014 degrees over the past 10 years which is below even the lowest estimate also not a single year was warmer than 1998 despite the paper predicting that at least three years would be the above chart credit kalte sonne shows the met offices observed data thin grey line with the smith et al predictions red and blue lines and the real trend thick black line overlaid we can clearly see that not only does to real trend fall well outside the range of smith et als predictions it actually drops slightly writing for the german climate blog die kalte sonne scientist frank bosse says that the smith et al study failed to take into account known ocean cycles and other natural factors smith has since written another paper taking more factors into account but bosse writes that the range of

coverage has too many fluffy badgers bbcs coverage of rural issues is squeamish simplistic and has too many pictures of fluffy badgers anita singh telegraph 26th june 2014 the bbcs coverage of countryside issues is too squeamish ignoring the gritty realities of rural life and favouring images of fluffy badgers a report has found there is a deficit in reporting on rural affairs with important stories overlooked according to the independent review commissioned by the bbc trust issues of health education and employment in rural areas are rarely covered the report concluded with the corporation preferring to focus on protests or animal stories with a feelgood ending coverage of the badger cull provoked the greatest anger amongst rural dwellers the report noted the predominant use of images of healthy badgers to open or conclude a report was felt to weight the argument in favour of the anticull lobby people asked where were the pictures of sick badgers with tb or infected cows being shot or a distraught farming family coming to terms with the loss of their animals to some people it felt like the images asked which do you like most the cow or the badger the audience research picked up criticism of the number of fluffy badgers in pictures and said it was never going to result in an impartial impression in their opinion the emotional response of protesters was readily captured by reporters but the same was not the case for farmers farmers said it felt like the images asked which do you like most the cow or the badger farmers complained they had been portrayed as villains some said they had been reluctant to show their faces on television because they feared retribution from protesters but one rural landowner remarked if it was some issue like female genital mutilation the bbc would go to some effort to help the person speak – disguise voices and things like that the issue of feelgood reporting was mentioned in relation to a piece about snow on the isle of arran where thousands of sheep died as a result of the terrible weather it ended with a shot of a lamb in front of an aga in yorkshire mark hedges editor of country life said coverage was often sanitised and did the countryside a real disservice in the process he added the bbc is incredibly squeamish about the countryside the research found that the bbcs use of celebrities to illustrate stories such as brian may discussing the badger cull were not appreciated by rural audiences celebrity contributions on controversial subjects were unwelcome the audience found it irritating and perplexing the report was carried out by heather hancock chair of the bbcs rural affairs committee she was full of praise for countryside programming outside the main news bulletins applauding countryfile farming today and even the archers in addition to specials including lambing live and springwatch viewers said they were impressed by pieces on bbc breakfast and discussions on jeremy vines radio 2 show coverage in scotland wales and northern ireland is also impressive she said and across the board the reporting was generally impartial however she expressed significant concerns over coverage in england audiences feel network news coverage can be simplistic and on contentious stories too often focused on protest rather than the underlying issues she said concentrating on two extremes – a rosetinted view or extreme hardship – was felt to obscure the gritty realities of rural life on the issue of country pursuits many i spoke to felt there was a gulf in understanding between the bbc and a significant segment of the rural community rural audiences detected a lack of understanding and a squeamishness stories are too often viewed through the lens of environmentalism and there is too narrow a range of voices on air with the rspb nfu and national trust given a disproportionate amount of airtime audiences also perceive a metropolitan bias despite the fact that 12 million people live in the countryside – twice the population of london one example given was last years flooding with the bbc perceived by some to have ignored the issue until it reached the thames valley in the words of one respondent it changed when the effluent met the affluent julie nelson rural officer for the church of england said rural audiences were largely left out of the bbcs output the countryside is only interesting when its dramatic or beautiful but the ordinary everyday life isnt i think shown when theres a murder or floods suddenly a village becomes news you get the story and then it moves on the research also found that those who live in metropolitan areas have little understanding or interest in rural affairs according to the report both in london and glasgow living in rural areas was seen as a lifestyle choice in glasgow it was largely seen as just a rather impractical lifestyle in london on the whole it was seen as an inexplicably and baffling one one audience member taking part in the london group could not comprehend why anyone living in the countryside would even want a good broadband connection responding to the trust report a bbc management spokesman said we take our commitment to the reporting of rural affairs very seriously and welcome the reports endorsement of our programming and overall impartiality whilst the report finds overall we do a good job reflecting and reporting rural affairs there are areas where we can do better and we have committed to a range of steps to help improve the coverage further top north korea claims to have tested precision guided missile announcement comes after south korea said it detected three shortrange projectiles coming down in the sea of japan the guardian 27th june 2014 north korea claims to have successfully tested a new precision guided missile at the same time as its army threatens a devastating retaliation against south korea for carrying out live fire drills near their maritime border the launch was watched by the north korean leader kim jongun according to the norths official kcna news agency which hailed the test as a breakthrough in national defence capability north korea is not known to possess a tactical guided missile but analysis of a recent propaganda film suggested it may have acquired a variant of a russian cruise missile the kh35 kcna did not specify the timing of the test but it appeared to coincide with the firing on thursday of what south korea described as three shortrange projectiles into the sea of japan the rodong sinmun the official newspaper of the norths ruling party published pictures on friday of the new missile being tested with kim in attendance south koreas defence ministry related the latest test to pyongyangs efforts to improve its largecalibre multiple rocket launching mrl systems the mrl ranges have been extended and guidance capabilities added to the projectiles spokesman kim minseok said washington said it was looking into the technical specifics to determine the threat level technically obviously any launch of anything is problematic is escalatory in nature is threatening said us state department spokeswoman marie harf on thursday the korean peoples army kpa released a statement on kcna condemning recent south korean live fire exercises near their disputed maritime border in the yellow sea the souths defence ministry declined to confirm that any particular drills had taken place but said routine exercises in the area of the maritime border were common yun dukmin a professor at the institute of foreign affairs and national security in seoul said the development of a tactical guided missile would be an obvious military hazard to south korea and the us bases it hosts a precision weapon would also be a response to south koreas homegrown development of a cruise missile that was displayed during a military parade in seoul last october according to the souths defence ministry the hyeonmu 3s accuracy made it capable of striking the office window of the norths command headquarters in pyongyang interkorean relations have been tense for some months following annual south koreaus military exercises

mainly nonlethal support has been cleared for the rebels since march 2011 and the cia has participated in a secret military training programme in neighbouring jordan for the moderate oppositionthe 500m in aid is part of a proposed 15bn regional stabilisation initiative to bolster syrian neighbours jordan lebanon turkey and iraq and to support communities hosting refugeeshayden said us officials believe that there is no military solution to this crisis and that the united states should not put american troops into combatbut she said that the request for the rebels would help syrians push back against the growing number of extremists like isil who find safehaven in the chaos and take their future into their own hands by enhancing security and stability at local levelsmeanwhile the iraqi prime minister nouri almaliki has said he welcomed air attacks by syria against isil targets on iraqi soil after raids on the border town of alqaim on tuesdaymaliki told the bbc arabic that baghdad did not request the air raidsthere was no coordination involved but we welcome this action we welcome any syrian strike because this group targets both iraq and syria but we didnt make any request from syria they carry out their strikes and we carry out ours the final winners are our two countries he said in the bbc interviewbritain can not educate the world a senior judge said as he rejected a bid by a filipino family living in kent to stay in the country so their children could recieve a good educationthe familyoffive were challenging a ruling denying them indefinite leave to remain in the uk on the basis that it would be best for the three childrenbut lord justice lewison and two senior colleagues said the best thing for them would be to stay with their parents who have no right to stay in the countryi can not see that the desirability of being educated at public expense in the uk can outweigh the benefit to the children of remaining with their parents he saidjust as we can not provide medical treatment for the world so we can not educate the worldthe appeal court was rejecting a challenge by the mother to a decision by the home office immigration authorities upheld by immigration tribunal judges not to renew her familys permission to remain after her work permit ran outlawyers for the care home nurse who for legal reasons can only be referred to as ev launched a lastditch argument that the best interests of her children and their education in the uk ranked above all immigration control considerationsthey contended it would not be proportionate to send them back to the philippines but would breach article 8 of the european convention on human rights which safeguards the right to private and family liferejecting the argument lord justice lewison said in the real world parents relied on the bests interests of their children in order to piggyback on their rightsin evs case the mother had no right to remain in the uk and the interests of the family members had to be considered in the light of the real world factsthe judge said in our case none of the family is a british citizen none has a right to remain in this countryif the parents are removed then it is entirely reasonable to expect the children to go with themthe judge also observed that the immigration judge whose decision the court was upholding had weighed the best interests of the children without explicitly considering the cost to the public purse in providing education to these childrenhe said the courts had ruled that the cost would have been an appropriate considerationif anything therefore the immigration judge adopted an approach too favourable to the appellantlord justice clarke said ev was a skilled care worker who entered the uk with a work permit and was given permission to stay until february 2011she worked at a care home in kent and was joined by her husband bv in april 2008 and then by the couples three children a daughter now aged 15 a son aged 12 and daughter aged nine in july 2009evs application for indefinite leave to remain was rejected by the home office immigration authorities leading to a complex series of legal challenges involving the first tier immigration tribunal and the upper tribunalafter losing her case against removal before both tribunals the mother was given permission to test in the appeal court whether her childrens rights not to have their education disrupted should take precedencelord justice clarke said evs job did not involve the requisite level of skill and she was not earning enough to be allowed to remain in the country under the immigration rulesan immigration tribunal judge had accepted she had been defrauded and underpaid by the care home owner who employed her she had not at first informed the home office authorities of this but the issue had now been taken into consideration and she was still being refused permission to remainlord justice clarke said the question for the appeal court was whether it would be proportionate to remove the children as they had received an excellent report from the deputy head of their school in kentall family members had formed friendships in their local community and it was in the best interests of the children that their education was not disruptedbut said the judge the education system in the philippines was sufficiently good ev herself had obtained an msc degree in nursing there and the childrens interests did not outweigh the need for immigration controlev and her husband would be employable in the philippines the family which had only been in the uk for a limited time would also have access to an extended family and not be homelessthe children would not be without education in the philippines although it would not be as good as in the uk and secondary education was not free in that countryschoolchildren from white workingclass homes should be entitled to the same kind of remedial language support as pupils who have english as a second language because without extra help they are falling behind their foreignspeaking classmates research has foundsome workingclass children are arriving at school unable to recognise their own names and need just as much help to allow them to communicate with their peers a conference will be told todaymembers of staff felt that the school grants needed to be rethought as there is currently no money to support the language deficit within the white workingclass community argues the study by dr feyisa demie head of research and statistics at lambeth council and dr kirstin lewis from goldsmiths collegeit said school ethnic minority achievement coordinators had found many students with english as a second language are articulate by the time they reach year 6 the last year in primary school due to the level of support they have hadfurthermore many schools reflected on the fact that pupils with english as an additional language eal needs arriving new to a school receive a thorough induction process it addedbut when it came to white workingclass pupils the coordinators said their hands were tied and that as much as some white workingclass pupils needed specific language support to progress and access the curriculum they were not in a position to give this supportone told researchers i was with some children the other day in a classroom – it was the eal children who had the necessary comparative language bigger biggest the white children did not have the vocabularythe report added governors believe the current system of additional funding means some schools serving white workingclass estates do not receive adequate financial support the consequences of an ability to express oneself either verbally or in writing can lead to low selfesteem and often aggressionone primary school teacher said many of the white children as do others come into school well below average they havent got the skills they cant recognise their own namethe report is due to be presented at a conference at london universitys institute for education todayit confirmed the findings of a commons select committee on education report last week in which mps revealed that white workingclass pupils were the poorest performers of any ethnic group in exams and testsprofessor alan smithers head of the centre for education and employment at buckingham university said we tend to provide very good tuition for students who come from abroad there is a whole profession build up around english as a second language but really english is to some extent a second language to a lot of young people born in this countryone of the ways of raising the performance of white workingclass pupils is to give them help as if english was a foreign languagein contrast to todays findings black pupils are now the fastest improving ethnic group after years languishing as the poorest performers as the independent revealed yesterdaydr tony sewell who founded the charity generating genius – set up to help disadvantaged black youths but now widened in scope to cover white workingclass pupils as well – said a child from a west african background that is lower middleclass might better be able to access english than a white workingclass boy on an estatetodays report also concluded that social deprivation and housing conditions play their part in limiting the achievements of whiteworking class pupilsone of the main reasons for pupil underachievement is a perceived lack of aspiration amongst parents for their childrens future and a lack of engagement in their schooling it saidone headteacher told the authors many of our parents are young with a legacy of hostility to schoolanother teacher added that white workingclass parents did not possess the immigrant mentalitythe report concluded that the main obstacle in raising achievement is the governments failure to recognise that this group has particular needs that are not being met by the school systemhowever the government argues that – with its pupil premium giving schools extra cash to take in disadvantaged pupils – schools now have the wherewithal to deal with underperformanceiraqi insurgents executed at least 160

of locating bodies and accessing the area has prevented a full investigation it saidafter overrunning large swaths of northern iraq and capturing the cities of mosul and tikrit earlier this month the islamic extremist group posted graphic photos on a militant website that appeared to show fighters loading dozens of captured soldiers on to flatbed trucks before forcing them to lie in a shallow ditch with their hands tied behind their backs a final set of photos shows what appear to be dead bodiesthe photos and satellite images from tikrit provide strong evidence of a horrible war crime that needs further investigation peter bouckaert emergencies director at human rights watch said in a statement the militants apparently executed at the very least 160 people in tikritchief iraqi military spokesman lt gen qassim almoussawi confirmed the photos authenticity after they surfaced on 15 june and said he was aware of cases of mass murder of captured iraqi soldiers in areas held by isishe said at the time that an examination of the images by military experts showed that about 170 soldiers were shot to death by the militants after their capturecaptions on the photos showing the soldiers after they were shot say hundreds have been liquidated but the total could not immediately be verifiedthe massacre appeared to be aimed at instilling fear in iraqs demoralised armed forces – which melted away as militants seized much of the north in a matter of days – as well as the countrys shia majority whom isis views as apostateshuman rights watch said its analysis of the photos showed two

myanmar they sit beneath garish signs and posters testifying to their friendliness and industriousness or advertising super promo rates and special discountssome maid agencies as theyre known locally display women at work along one aisle domestic workers push each other around in wheelchairs as though theyre taking care of the elderly in another gallery a woman cradles a baby doll and pretends to change its diapers others stand in mock living rooms ironing the same shirt or making the same bed scenes enacted elsewhere in singapore at malls like katong shopping centre on mountbatten roadjolovan wham executive director of the humanitarian organisation of migration economics home a migrant workers advocacy group based in singapore said that some agencies market their domestic workers like commodities he adds that racial stereotypes are sometimes used in transactions with patrons some of the stereotypes include filipinos as smarter indonesians as less bright and burmese as sweetnatured and compliantthere have also been complaints of women being underfed at certain employment agencies according to ummai ummairoh president of the indonesian family network ifn we always receive calls about agencies not giving enough food in one case an agency was spending 20 to feed 40 peopleummairoh who also worked as a maid added that the shopping centres made women look like dolls at a supermarketfor anandha nurul a domestic worker who spent seven years in singapore her time at the shopping malls was marked by boredom and long hours they did not treat me very nicely she said recalling that she was fed instant noodles for the three days she was at her agency we didnt even boil the noodles properly we just used warm waterbut standards vary considerably within the industry and other agencies claim to afford female domestic workers more dignified conditions we should be fair and treat these workers as human beings said dawn sng of primechoice maid agency who claims that her agency provides domestic workers with inhouse training free meals and counselling we should not put them into a lower category of peoplebukit timah and other shopping centres like it are the culmination of networks and organisations extending from singapore to various parts of southeast asia from brokers who recruit women from poor countries to training centres that prepare women for life abroad to runners who ferry domestic workers from airports to shopping centres and finally to the employment agencies themselves of which there are hundreds in singapore competing in what is effectively a multimillion dollar industry wham says that there are currently 215000 domestic workers in singaporewe have continually advocated that the livein requirement is unsatisfactory because it easily leads to abuse shelley thio transient workers count toofor most women according to wham the shopping centres are fleeting experiences that last no longer than a week before coming to singapore most domestic workers have already found their employers after a phone or webcam interview from their home countries the malls are essentially transition points and the women are soon sent to their employers after completing a settlingin programme and a mandatory heath checkbut some maids return to the malls and can end up staying there for as long as a month in the language of employment agencies these women are transfer maids and have either been released by their original employers or have requested to leave after experiencing problems at workshelley thio executive member of transient workers count too twc2 attributes most problems to working conditions and cites verbal abuse nonpayment of wages and excessive work hours as among the most common reasons domestic workers request formal transfersthio also raised concerns over singapores livein requirement by which a fulltime domestic worker is legally obliged to live in the home of her employerwe have continually advocated that the livein requirement is unsatisfactory because it easily leads to abuse thio said adding that some women become vulnerable because of the removal of mobile phones which isolates them from friends and organisations such as home and twc2the livein requirement can leave women vulnerable to sexual abuse earlier this year a cambodian domestic worker was sexually harassed by her employers father with whom she was made to share a room although the woman had complained about this arrangement both to her employers and employment agency nothing was done to change her situation prior to the abuseproblems in singapore are sometimes compounded by unscrupulous practises and weak oversight in the female workers underdeveloped home countries in indonesian training centres for instance women commonly complain that dormitories are overcrowded and that they are not given enough food according to wahyu susilo of the advocacy group migrant carewe are always finding migrant workers in cramped rooms and living with poor sanitary conditions in one case we found 200 migrant workers sharing two or three toiletshe adds that monitoring by the indonesian government is generally weak which has led to exploitative conditions at a number of centres including unreasonable fees and deceptive recruitment practisesin some cases monitoring of training centres in originating countries is limited due to corruption according to the managing director of one centre in indonesia who spoke to al jazeera on the condition of anonymity local police accept bribes from the training centres they are tasked with inspectingmost domestic workers who come to singapore have large debts in the form of placement fees paid to agencies as monthly salary deductionsthio at twc2 said that she has come across instances where domestic workers end up owing 4500 to their agencies adding that the average debts women accumulate are between 2500 and 3000high placement fees are charged to the worker because the agencies can get away with it according to wham who said that some agencies disguise these fees as loansthe worker pays these fees because she feels that she doesnt have a choice and our laws do not make it mandatory for employers to bear the bulk of the feessome domestic maids also work in singapore illegally a number of women are employed even though they are underage according to thio and some will be brought into the country under conditions indicative of traffickingbut at shopping centres where clients stroll past homekeeper and budget maid and where domestic workers continue their unending simulation of household work little of this is expressed or knowni watched all those things recounts istiana an indonesian domestic worker who has recently come to work

bosse concludesthe bbcs coverage of countryside issues is too squeamish ignoring the gritty realities of rural life and favouring images of fluffy badgers a report has foundthere is a deficit in reporting on rural affairs with important stories overlooked according to the independent review commissioned by the bbc trustissues of health education and employment in rural areas are rarely covered the report concluded with the corporation preferring to focus on protests or animal stories with a feelgood endingcoverage of the badger cull provoked the greatest anger amongst rural dwellersthe report noted the predominant use of images of healthy badgers to open or conclude a report was felt to weight the argument in favour of the anticull lobby people asked where were the pictures of sick badgers with tb or infected cows being shot or a distraught farming family coming to terms with the loss of their animalsto some people it felt like the images asked which do you like most the cow or the badgerthe audience research picked up criticism of the number of fluffy badgers in pictures and said it was never going to result in an impartial impression in their opinionthe emotional response of protesters was readily captured by reporters but the same was not the case for farmersfarmers said it felt like the images asked which do you like most the cow or the badgerfarmers complained they had been portrayed as villains some said they had been reluctant to show their faces on television because they feared retribution from protesters but one rural landowner remarked if it was some issue like female genital mutilation the bbc would go to some effort to help the person speak – disguise voices and things like thatthe issue of feelgood reporting was mentioned in relation to a piece about snow on the isle of arran where thousands of sheep died as a result of the terrible weatherit ended with a shot of a lamb in front of an aga in yorkshiremark hedges editor of country life said coverage was often sanitised and did the countryside a real disservice in the process he added the bbc is incredibly squeamish about the countrysidethe research found that the bbcs use of celebrities to illustrate stories such as brian may discussing the badger cull were not appreciated by rural audiencescelebrity contributions on controversial subjects were unwelcome the audience found it irritating and perplexingthe report was carried out by heather hancock chair of the bbcs rural affairs committeeshe was full of praise for countryside programming outside the main news bulletins applauding countryfile farming today and even the archers in addition to specials including lambing live and springwatch viewers said they were impressed by pieces on bbc breakfast and discussions on jeremy vines radio 2 showcoverage in scotland wales and northern ireland is also impressive she said and across the board the reporting was generally impartial however she expressed significant concerns over coverage in englandaudiences feel network news coverage can be simplistic and on contentious stories too often focused on protest rather than the underlying issues she saidconcentrating on two extremes – a rosetinted view or extreme hardship – was felt to obscure the gritty realities of rural lifeon the issue of country pursuits many i spoke to felt there was a gulf in understanding between the bbc and a significant segment of the rural community rural audiences detected a lack of understanding and a squeamishnessstories are too often viewed through the lens of environmentalism and there is too narrow a range of voices on air with the rspb nfu and national trust given a disproportionate amount of airtimeaudiences also perceive a metropolitan bias despite the fact that 12 million people live in the countryside – twice the population of londonone example given was last years flooding with the bbc perceived by some to have ignored the issue until it reached the thames valley in the words of one respondent it changed when the effluent met the affluentjulie nelson rural officer for the church of england said rural audiences were largely left out of the bbcs output the countryside is only interesting when its dramatic or beautiful but the ordinary everyday life isnt i think shown when theres a murder or floods suddenly a village becomes news you get the story and then it moves onthe research also found that those who live in metropolitan areas have little understanding or interest in rural affairsaccording to the report both in london and glasgow living in rural areas was seen as a lifestyle choice in glasgow it was largely seen as just a rather impractical lifestyle in london on the whole it was seen as an inexplicably and baffling oneone audience member taking part in the london group could not comprehend why anyone living in the countryside would even want a good broadband connectionresponding to the trust report a bbc management spokesman said we take our commitment to the reporting of rural affairs very seriously and welcome the reports endorsement of our programming and overall impartialitywhilst the report finds overall we do a good job reflecting and reporting rural affairs there are areas where we can do better and we have committed to a range of steps to help improve the coverage furthernorth korea claims

that the fez cell had managed to send 10 jihadists to syria these were sent out to different camps for intensive military training on the use of various weapons guerilla warfare kidnapping as well as rigging vehicles with explosives for later terrorist operations the sources said moroccan jihadists in syria were being trained to execute suicide attacks in their home country the cell was luring moroccans from the cities of fez and taza in central morocco in terms of funding the cell depended on direct assistance from six of its executive members who dealt in smuggling for additional funds in order to send fighters to syria the cell also collected money from the jihadist salafist movement in fez and from sympathizers from the northwest of the country in an unprecedented statement ahmad toufi the minister of islamic affairs revealed that there was perfect coordination between the religious and security authorities on the matter of the moroccan fighters in syria the youngest member of

brutalized the libyan people for more than forty years now they are about to elect a new parliament for the second time since his fall enthusiasm is limited wednesday 25062014 was a hot day in the libyan capital tripoli 44 degrees celsius 111 fahrenheit in the shade but mohammed akila went out to vote anyway the libyans want security stability and a wellrun state like the rest of the developed world he said akila hopes that electing a new parliament will help to achieve that munira ashour a teacher has also cast her ballot i voted so that we can build libya up again but akila and ashour are in a minority it was already clear ahead of the election that peoples expectations of politics had dropped significantly only 15 million of the 34 million libyans have registered to vote at the first election of the general national congress two years ago it was 27 million this time according to the electoral commission 630000 libyans cast their vote on wednesday not even half of those who registered the commission blamed the hot weather but that can only partially explain libyans reluctance many people are frustrated three years after the fall of dictator moammar gadhafi the country has fallen into a vortex of violence and political power games vote counting is currently underway and first results are expected soon the security situation is so tense that polling stations in certain regions were not even opened according to official statements this happened in the eastern city of darnah a center for islamists alkufra in the southeast the scene of regular battles between tribal militias and the southern city of sabha the revolutionaries divided among themselves have not succeeded in forming a functioning democracy in a country that for decades was under an authoritarian regime a new democratically legitimate power structure was supposed to be put in place in spring 2013 but libyans are still waiting for the constitution that they voted for by referendum to be implemented the united nations urged the parliamentary elections to take place as soon as possible in the hope that this would prevent another escalation of violence these elections are an important step in libyas transformation to a stable democracy the un security council declared this week the interim parliaments mandate ran out in february when parliamentarians tried to extend their tenure until december there were street protests with people accusing the parliamentarians of tolerating islamist militias and being obsessed with internal divisions militia power mattia toaldo libya expert at the european council on foreign relations ecfr thinks the parliamentary elections are little more than a partial solution to the crisis in libya much more important would be to find a consensus between all the different power factions in the country the power in libya he says doesnt lie in the parliament but with the various militia leaders and they mainly pursue their own interests following gadhafis fall hardly any of the militias gave up their weapons according to the international crisis group around 125000 of the approximately six million libyans are still armed and the central government and the official army are still too weak to offer the militias any resistance libyan political scientist salem soltan fears that the new parliamentarians do not have the necessary political weight to change the situation in the country the risk is too great that warlords and militia chiefs will continue to hold the reins of power in the future enemies of balance a lot of the warlords says toaldo have absolutely no interest in a peaceful solution to the power struggle one example would be retired major general khalifa haftar who is currently conducting military operations against islamist forces in the port town of benghazi in eastern libya these forces dont believe in talks or powersharing toaldo said they believe they can win the upper hand militarily on the other hand extremist groups like ansar alsharia arent known for their great love of democracy either the threat of a civil war is great in eastern libya and yet it is still too early to suggest that the arab spring has failed according to toaldo its a transitional process and we still dont know where it will end he said we shouldnt forget how destructive 42 years of gadhafis reign were the country has no institutions no parties no independent media no civil society all that takes time he says what libya does have is natural resources and i dont just mean oil but also the large welleducated and dynamic diaspora so we should remain optimistic you can read top that she would sleep with 1012 men a night if she had toa nigerian pop singer and peace ambassador has sent shock

Francois Hollande, David Cameron and Angela Merkel in Belgium yesterday\n\n \n\n Mr Cameron said he was “completely unapologetic” in his opposition to the appointment, believing that the former Luxembourg premier will provide an obstacle to EU reform.\n\n \n\n Britain now cuts a lonely figure among its peers after Germany stated that it will fully back Mr Juncker, while both the Netherlands and Sweden changed tack and have also now claimed they will support him.\n\n \n\n Mr Cameron says his appointment will not address the growing EU scepticism in the UK or the \"pro reform message\" that he says voters gave in the European elections last month.\n\n \n\n Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stub, however, said today that some people in the UK \"really seriously need to wake up and smell the coffee.\"\n\n \n\n Speaking to reporters at the EU Summit, Mr Stub added: \"The EU is a very good thing for the UK.

Francois Hollande, David Cameron and Angela Merkel in Belgium yesterdayMr Cameron said he was “completely unapologetic” in his opposition to the appointment, believing that the former Luxembourg premier will provide an obstacle to EU reform.Britain now cuts a lonely figure among its peers after Germany stated that it will fully back Mr Juncker, while both the Netherlands and Sweden changed tack and have also now claimed they will support him.Mr Cameron says his appointment will not address the growing EU scepticism in the UK or the \"pro reform message\" that he says voters gave in the European elections last month.Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stub, however, said today that some people in the UK \"really seriously need to wake up and smell the coffee.\"Speaking to reporters at the EU Summit, Mr Stub added: \"The EU is a very good thing for the UK. Over 50 per cent of the trade of the UK goes to the EU.

There is no military solution to this crisis and ... the United States should not put American troops into combat in Syria \n\n Caitlin Hayden, National Security Council spokeswoman \n\n \n\n \n\n The National Security Council's spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the funding \"would build on the administration's long-standing efforts to empower the moderate Syrian opposition\".\n\n \n\n About $287m in mainly non-lethal support has been cleared for the rebels since March 2011, and the CIA has participated in a secret military training programme in neighbouring Jordan for the 'moderate' opposition.\n\n \n\n The $500m in aid is part of a proposed $1.5bn \"regional stabilisation initiative\" to bolster Syrian neighbours Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq, and to support communities hosting refugees.\n\n \n\n Hayden said US officials \"believe that there is no military solution to this crisis and that the United States should not put American troops into combat.\"\n\n \n\n But she said that the request for the rebels would help Syrians \"push back against the growing number of extremists like ISIL, who find safe-haven in the chaos, and take their future into their own hands by enhancing security and stability at local levels.\"\n\n \n\n Meanwhile the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has said he \"welcomed\" air attacks by Syria against ISIL targets on Iraqi soil, after raids on the border town of al-Qaim on Tuesday.\n\n \n\n Maliki told the BBC Arabic that Baghdad did not request the air raids.\n\n \n\n \"There was no coordination involved, but we welcome this action. We welcome any Syrian strike ... because this group targets both Iraq and Syria ... But we didn't make any request from Syria. They carry out their strikes and we carry out ours.

None has a right to remain in this country....\n\n \n\n \"If the parents are removed, then it is entirely reasonable to expect the children to go with them.\"\n\n \n\n The judge also observed that the immigration judge whose decision the court was upholding had weighed the best interests of the children without explicitly considering \"the cost to the public purse in providing education to these children\".\n\n \n\n He said the courts had ruled that the cost would have been an \"appropriate\" consideration.\n\n \"If anything, therefore, the immigration judge adopted an approach too favourable to the appellant.\"\n\n \n\n Lord Justice Clarke said EV was a skilled care worker who entered the UK with a work permit and was given permission to stay until February 2011.\n\n \n\n She worked at a care home in Kent and was joined by her husband, BV, in April 2008, and then by the couple's three children - a daughter now aged 15, a son aged 12 and daughter aged nine - in July 2009.\n\n \n\n EV's application for indefinite leave to remain was rejected by the Home Office immigration authorities, leading to a complex series of legal challenges involving the First Tier immigration tribunal and the Upper Tribunal.\n\n \n\n After losing her case against removal before both tribunals, the mother was given permission to test in the appeal court whether her children's rights not to have their education disrupted should take precedence.\n\n \n\n Lord Justice Clarke said EV's job did not involve the requisite level of skill and she was not earning enough to be allowed to remain in the country under the immigration rules.\n\n \n\n An immigration tribunal judge had accepted she had been defrauded and underpaid by the care home owner who employed her. She had not at first informed the Home Office authorities of this, but the issue had now been taken into consideration, and she was still being refused permission to remain.\n\n \n\n Lord Justice Clarke said the question for the appeal court was whether it would be \"proportionate\" to remove the children as they had received \"an excellent report\" from the deputy head of their school in Kent.\n\n \n\n All family members had formed friendships in their local community and it was in the best interests of the children that their education was not disrupted.\n\n \n\n But, said the judge, the education system in the Philippines was sufficiently good - EV herself had obtained an M.Sc degree in nursing there - and the children's interests did not outweigh the need for immigration control.\n\n \n\n EV and her husband would be employable in the Philippines. The family, which had only been in the UK for a limited time, would also have access to an extended family and not be homeless.\n\n \n\n The children would not be without education in the Philippines, although it would not be as good as in the UK and secondary education was not free in that country.\n\n \n\n [top]\n\n \n\n Poor white pupils need extra help with English \n\n Richard Garner - Independent - 27th June 2014 \n\n \n\n Schoolchildren from white working-class homes should be entitled to the same kind of remedial language support as pupils who have English as a second language, because without extra help they are falling behind their foreign-speaking classmates, research has found.\n\n \n\n Some working-class children are arriving at school unable to recognise their own names, and need just as much help to allow them to communicate with their peers, a conference will be told today.\n\n \n\n “Members of staff felt that the school grants needed to be rethought as there is currently no money to support the language deficit within the white working-class community,” argues the study by Dr Feyisa Demie, head of research and statistics at Lambeth Council, and Dr Kirstin Lewis, from Goldsmith’s College.\n\n \n\n It said school ethnic minority achievement co-ordinators had found many students with English as a second language “are articulate by the time they reach Year 6 [the last year in primary school] due to the level of support they have had”.\n\n \n\n “Furthermore, many schools reflected on the fact that pupils with English as an additional language [EAL] needs arriving new to a school receive a thorough induction process,” it added.\n\n \n\n But when it came to white working-class pupils, the co-ordinators said their “hands were tied and that, as much as some white working-class pupils needed specific language support to progress and access the curriculum, they were not in a position to give this support”.\n\n \n\n One told researchers: “I was with some children the other day in a classroom – it was the EAL children who had the necessary comparative language: bigger, biggest. The white children did not have the vocabulary.”\n\n \n\n The report added: “Governors believe the current system of additional funding means some schools serving white working-class estates do not receive adequate financial support... The consequences of an ability to express oneself either verbally or in writing can lead to low self-esteem and often aggression.”\n\n \n\n One primary school teacher said: “Many of the white children, as do others, come into school well below average; they haven’t got the skills; they can’t recognise their own name.”\n\n \n\n The report is due to be presented at a conference at London University’s Institute for Education today.\n\n \n\n It confirmed the findings of a Commons Select Committee on Education report last week in which MPs revealed that white working-class pupils were the poorest performers of any ethnic group in exams and tests.\n\n \n\n Professor Alan Smithers, head of the Centre for Education and Employment at Buckingham University, said: “We tend to provide very good tuition for students who come from abroad. There is a whole profession build up around English as a second language, but really English is to some extent a second language to a lot of young people born in this country.\n\n \n\n “One of the ways of raising the performance of white working-class pupils is to give them help as if English was a foreign language.”\n\n \n\n In contrast to today’s findings, black pupils are now the fastest improving ethnic group after years languishing as the poorest performers as The Independent revealed yesterday.\n\n \n\n Dr Tony Sewell, who founded the charity Generating Genius – set up to help disadvantaged black youths but now widened in scope to cover white working-class pupils as well – said: “A child from a West African background that is lower middle-class might better be able to access English than a white working-class boy on an estate.”\n\n \n\n Today’s report also concluded that social deprivation and housing conditions play their part in limiting the achievements of white-working class pupils.\n\n \n\n “One of the main reasons for pupil underachievement is a perceived lack of aspiration amongst parents for their children’s future and a lack of engagement in their schooling”, it said.\n\n \n\n One headteacher told the authors: “Many of our parents are young, with a legacy of hostility to school.”\n\n \n\n Another teacher added that white working-class parents did not “possess the immigrant mentality”.\n\n \n\n The report concluded that “The main obstacle in raising achievement is the Government’s failure to recognise that this group has particular needs that are not being met by the school system.”\n\n \n\n However, the Government argues that – with its “pupil premium” giving schools extra cash to take in disadvantaged pupils – schools now have the wherewithal to deal with underperformance.\n\n \n\n [top]\n\n \n\n Isis execution site revealed by satellite images, claims human rights group \n\n Grisly photos and satellite images provide evidence of 'horrible war crime' in which at least 160 died, says Human Rights Watch\n\n \n\n The Guardian - 27th June 2014 \n\n \n\n Iraqi insurgents executed at least 160 captives earlier this month in the northern city of Tikrit, Human Rights Watch has said, citing an analysis of satellite imagery and grisly photosgraphs released by the militants.\n\n \n\n The US-based group said militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) killed between 160 and 190 men in two locations in Tikrit between 11-14 June.\n\n \n\n \"The number of victims may well be much higher, but the difficulty of locating bodies and accessing the area has prevented a full investigation,\" it said.\n\n \n\n After overrunning large swaths of northern Iraq and capturing the cities of Mosul and Tikrit earlier this month, the Islamic extremist group posted graphic photos on a militant website that appeared to show fighters loading dozens of captured soldiers on to flatbed trucks before forcing them to lie in a shallow ditch with their hands tied behind their backs. A final set of photos shows what appear to be dead bodies.\n\n \n\n \"The photos and satellite images from Tikrit provide strong evidence of a horrible war crime that needs further investigation,\" Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. The militants \"apparently executed at the very least 160 people in Tikrit\".\n\n \n\n Chief Iraqi military spokesman Lt Gen Qassim al-Moussawi confirmed the photos' authenticity after they surfaced on 15 June and said he was aware of cases of mass murder of captured Iraqi soldiers in areas held by Isis.\n\n \n\n He said at the time that an examination of the images by military experts showed that about 170 soldiers were shot to death by the militants after their capture.\n\n \n\n Captions on the photos showing the soldiers after they were shot say \"hundreds have been liquidated\", but the total could not immediately be verified.\n\n \n\n The massacre appeared to be aimed at instilling fear in Iraq's demoralised armed forces – which melted away as militants seized much of the north in a matter of days – as well as the country's Shia majority, whom Isis views as apostates.\n\n \n\n Human Rights Watch said its analysis of the photos showed two trenches in the same location, and that using satellite imagery from 2013 and publicly available photos taken earlier it was able to pinpoint the execution site in a field near a former palace of late dictator Saddam Hussein next to the Tigris river.\n\n \n\n It said satellite imagery of the site from 16 June did not reveal bodies but showed indications of vehicles and earth movement consistent with the two shallow trenches visible in the photos.\n\n \n\n [top]\n\n \n\n Putin's senior aide brands Poroshenko a 'Nazi' ahead of 'illegitimate' EU deal signing \n\n Comments come as thousands lined up to cross the border into Russia\n\n as a shaky cease fire is due to end today\n\n \n\n Heather Saul - Independent - 27th June 2014 \n\n \n\n Sergei Glazyev’s comments came shortly before the Ukrainian president signed the full association agreement at the EU summit in Brussels amid a precarious ceasefire between government troops and pro-Russian rebels.\n\n \n\n Mr Glazyev, Mr Putin's presidential adviser on regional economic integration, also described Mr Poroshenko’s endorsement of the deal as “illegitimate” and accused Europe of attempting to push Ukraine to sign the agreement, which is expected to take place later today “by force”.\n\n \n\n He told the BBC: \"They organised [a] military coup in Ukraine, they helped Nazis to come to power. This Nazi government is bombing the largest region in Ukraine.\"\n\n \n\n When asked if he believed Mr Poroshenko was a Nazi, he replied \"of course\", adding: \"I think after the signing of the agreement with EU, [the] European public will be... surprised when this Nazi Frankenstein, which was born by the Euro bureaucrats and some politicians, will knock on the European countries' doors.\"\n\n \n\n His inflammatory remarks follow news that four members of the Vienna-based Organisation for the Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) had been released in what Alexander Borodai, head of the Donetsk People's Republic, claimed was part of a goodwill gesture.\n\n \n\n \"We don't expect anything in return - we freed them without any pre-conditions,\" he said.\n\n \n\n The OSCE said four other members were also kidnapped by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine a month ago. Spokesman Steffen Seibert said leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France had agreed on Wednesday in a telephone call that the hostages should be freed without delay.\n\n \n\n Thousands of Ukrainians are reported to have lined up at the border with cars stuffed with their belongings to cross into Russia as the shaky cease fire entered its final hours today.\n\n \n\n Russia claims tens of thousands of Ukrainians have come in the two-and-a-half months since Ukraine's government began fighting separatists in the east, a heavily industrial region with a large population of ethnic Russians, many of whom feel strong ties to Moscow.\n\n \n\n Air strikes and artillery attacks by the Ukrainian military have infuriated many residents. Many crossing the border said they were fleeing the fighting, which has killed more than 400 people since mid-April by the United Nations' estimate.\n\n \n\n Talks to possibly extend the truce in Donetsk and Luhansk are set to take place on Friday. It will be the second round of talks since Monday in which the rebel leaders have participated.\n\n \n\n Mr Poroshenko has urged Russia to support his peace plan \"with deeds, not words\" a call echoed by the US Secretary of State John Kerry ahead of the summit of EU leaders, who will be considering a new round of sanctions against Russia.\n\n \n\n [top]\n\n \n\n Newsnight is 'made by 13-year-olds', says Jeremy Paxman \n\n The former host says his Conservative leanings made him a lone voice on the show as the younger producers wanted to change the world\n\n Hannah Furness - Telegraph - 26th June 2014 \n\n \n\n The BBC's flagship politics programme Newsnight is made by \"13-year-olds\", its former host Jeremy Paxman has said, as he suggests his Conservative leanings made him a lone voice on the show.\n\n \n\n Paxman, who made his last appearance on the flagship BBC programme earlier this month, said the makers of the programme were still young idealists, wanting to \"change the world\".\n\n \n\n He added his experience in politics had led him to be a \"one-nation Tory\", with youthful idealism being a \"fools' errand\".\n\n \n\n Speaking at the Chalke Valley History Festival, about his book on the First World War, he answered questions from the audience about his memorable tandem bike ride through the streets of London with Boris Johnson, which featured on the final programme.\n\n \n\n Footage broadcast on Newsnight saw the Mayor of London call Paxman the \"last\" one-nation Tory working at the BBC.\n\n \n\n \"I have to be frank, I suppose I am a one-nation Tory, yes,\" Paxman admitted. \"Look, Newsnight is made by 13-year-olds. It's perfectly normal when you're young that you want to change the world.\n\n \n\n \"The older you get, the more you realise what a fools' errand much of that is and that the thing to do is to manage the best you can to the advantage of as many people as possible.\"\n\n \n\n Paxman, who has had to be politically impartial throughout his journalism career, added of the interview: \"It's complete b------s, of course, typical Boris.\"\n\n \n\n On the question of whether he truly was the last Conservative at the BBC, he began to answer before stopping himself.\n\n \n\n \"If I had to...are there any members of the press here?\" he said, at the sold-out event. \"I think I'll plead the fifth on that one.\"\n\n \n\n His comments may be viewed by critics of the BBC as giving an insight into recent years at Newsnight, which has been plagued by mistakes made during the Savile scandal and accusations of \"dumbing down\".\n\n \n\n Paxman's latter encounters include an interview with comedian Russell Brand, while his colleague Kirsty Wark performed a dance to Michael Jackson's Thriller and Emily Maitlis interviewed the Cookie Monster.\n\n \n\n Its new editor, Ian Katz, joined from the Guardian newspaper a year ago.\n\n \n\n The public event also saw Paxman share his opinion of modern politics, saying: \"I am in favour of governments getting out of people's lives. Particularly foreign government.\n\n \n\n \"The closer you can take decision-making to the people affected by those decisions, the better.\"\n\n Europe, he said, had been the source of \"nothing but trouble for us\", and joked Belgium as a \"pointless little country\".\n\n \n\n When asked if he had relaxed his rule about never drinking before a show for his final appearance, he said: \"\"No I didn't have a drink beforehand, but perhaps I should have done.\"\n\n \n\n Paxman, who spent 25 years working on Newsnight, will continue to work for the BBC as the presenter of University Challenge, and is due to appear in a one-man show at the Edinburgh Festival this summer.\n\n \n\n His book, Britain's Great War, is out now.\n\n \n\n [top]\n\n \n\n Buy a discount maid at Singapore's malls \n\n In Singapore, maids are put on display and made available for 'purchase' in central shopping malls.\n\n Michael Malay - AJE - 27th June 2014 \n\n \n\n Go to the Bukit Timah Shopping Centre, a 1970s mall in central Singapore, and you will find five levels of brightly lit rooms and galleries called \"Homekeeper\" and \"Budget Maid\". Inside these rooms, dozens of women sit in a listless, artificial silence. They nod respectfully as you enter, and some watch closely as you speak to staff. You might take one home with you - for two years, or longer.\n\n \n\n The women, domestic workers, come from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar. They sit beneath garish signs and posters, testifying to their friendliness and industriousness, or advertising \"super promo\" rates and \"special discounts\".\n\n \n\n Some \"maid agencies\", as they're known locally, display women at work. Along one aisle, domestic workers push each other around in wheelchairs, as though they're taking care of the elderly. In another gallery, a woman cradles a baby doll and pretends to change its diapers. Others stand in mock living rooms ironing the same shirt, or making the same bed - scenes enacted elsewhere in Singapore at malls like Katong Shopping Centre on Mountbatten Road.\n\n \n\n Jolovan Wham, executive director of the Humanitarian Organisation of Migration Economics (HOME), a migrant workers advocacy group based in Singapore, said that some agencies market their domestic workers like \"commodities\". He adds that racial stereotypes are sometimes used in transactions with patrons. \"Some of the stereotypes include Filipinos as 'smarter', Indonesians as 'less bright' and Burmese as 'sweet-natured and compliant'.\"\n\n \n\n There have also been complaints of women being underfed at certain employment agencies, according to Ummai Ummairoh, president of the Indonesian Family Network (IFN). \"We always receive calls about agencies not giving enough food. In one case, an agency was spending $20 to feed 40 people.\"\n\n \n\n Ummairoh, who also worked as a maid, added that the shopping centres made women look like \"dolls at a supermarket\".\n\n \n\n For Anandha Nurul, a domestic worker who spent seven years in Singapore, her time at the shopping malls was marked by boredom and long hours. \"They did not treat me very nicely,\" she said, recalling that she was fed instant noodles for the three days she was at her agency. \"We didn't even boil the noodles properly. We just used warm water.\"\n\n \n\n But standards vary considerably within the industry, and other agencies claim to afford female domestic workers more dignified conditions. \"We should be fair and treat these workers as human beings,\" said Dawn Sng of PrimeChoice Maid Agency, who claims that her agency provides domestic workers with in-house training, free meals, and counselling. \"We should not put them into a lower category of people.\"\n\n \n\n A multimillion dollar industry\n\n Bukit Timah and other shopping centres like it are the culmination of networks and organisations extending from Singapore to various parts of Southeast Asia: from brokers who recruit women from poor countries, to training centres that prepare women for life abroad, to \"runners\" who ferry domestic workers from airports to shopping centres, and finally to the employment agencies themselves, of which there are hundreds in Singapore, competing in what is effectively a multimillion dollar industry. Wham says that there are currently 215,000 domestic workers in Singapore.\n\n \n\n We have continually advocated that the 'live-in' requirement is unsatisfactory because it easily leads to abuse.\n\n - Shelley Thio, Transient Workers Count Too\n\n \n\n For most women, according to Wham, the shopping centres are fleeting experiences that last no longer than a week. Before coming to Singapore, most domestic workers have already found their employers after a phone or webcam interview from their home countries. The malls are essentially transition points, and the women are soon sent to their employers after completing a \"settling-in programme\" and a mandatory heath check.\n\n \n\n But some maids return to the malls and can end up staying there for as long as a month. In the language of employment agencies, these women are \"transfer maids\", and have either been released by their original employers, or have requested to leave after experiencing problems at work.\n\n \n\n Shelley Thio, executive member of Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), attributes most problems to \"working conditions\", and cites verbal abuse, non-payment of wages, and excessive work hours as among the most common reasons domestic workers request formal transfers.\n\n \n\n Thio also raised concerns over Singapore's \"live-in\" requirement, by which a full-time domestic worker is legally obliged to live in the home of her employer.\n\n \n\n \"We have continually advocated that the live-in requirement is unsatisfactory because it easily leads to abuse,\" Thio said, adding that some women become vulnerable because of the removal of mobile phones, which isolates them from friends and organisations such as HOME and TWC2.\n\n \n\n The live-in requirement can leave women vulnerable to sexual abuse. Earlier this year, a Cambodian domestic worker was sexually harassed by her employer's father, with whom she was made to share a room. Although the woman had complained about this arrangement, both to her employers and employment agency, nothing was done to change her situation prior to the abuse.\n\n \n\n Poor monitoring and high debts\n\n Problems in Singapore are sometimes compounded by unscrupulous practises and weak oversight in the female workers' underdeveloped home countries. In Indonesian training centres, for instance, women commonly complain that dormitories are overcrowded and that they are not given enough food, according to Wahyu Susilo of the advocacy group Migrant Care.\n\n \n\n \"We are always finding migrant workers in cramped rooms and living with poor sanitary conditions. In one case we found 200 migrant workers sharing two or three toilets.\"\n\n \n\n He adds that monitoring by the Indonesian government is generally weak, which has led to exploitative conditions at a number of centres, including unreasonable fees and deceptive recruitment practises.\n\n \n\n In some cases, monitoring of training centres in originating countries is limited due to corruption. According to the managing director of one centre in Indonesia, who spoke to Al Jazeera on the condition of anonymity, local police accept bribes from the training centres they are tasked with inspecting.\n\n \n\n Most domestic workers who come to Singapore have large debts in the form of placement fees paid to agencies as monthly salary deductions.\n\n \n\n Thio at TWC2 said that she has come across instances where domestic workers end up owing $4,500 to their agencies, adding that the average debts women accumulate are between $2,500 and $3,000.\n\n \n\n \"High placement fees are charged to the worker because the agencies can get away with it,\" according to Wham, who said that some agencies disguise these fees as \"loans\".\n\n \n\n \"The worker pays these fees because she feels that she doesn't have a choice. And our laws do not make it mandatory for employers to bear the bulk of the fees.\"\n\n \n\n Some domestic maids also work in Singapore illegally. A number of women are employed even though they are underage, according to Thio, and some will be brought into the country under conditions indicative of trafficking.\n\n \n\n But at shopping centres, where clients stroll past \"Homekeeper\" and \"Budget Maid\", and where domestic workers continue their unending simulation of household work, little of this is expressed or known.\n\n \n\n \"I watched all those things\", recounts Istiana, an Indonesian domestic worker who has recently come to work in Singapore. \"Those signs that say 'cheap price' and 'discount maid'. But these are people,\" she added.\n\n \n\n [top]\n\n \n\n Global warming study ridiculed after temperatures drop \n\n Nick Hallett - Breitbart News Network -  26th June 2014 \n\n \n\n A UK Met Office study that predicted temperatures would rise by up to half a degree centigrade over the past 10 years faces ridicule after it was revealed that temperatures actually dropped over that period.\n\n \n\n The peer-reviewed study by Doug M. Smith et al, entitled “Improved Surface Temperature Prediction for the Coming Decade from a Global Climate Model” – and which featured in the journal Science – also incorrectly predicted that several years over the past decade would see record heat.\n\n \n\n The paper says:\n\n \n\n “…predict further warming during the coming decade, with the year 2014 predicted to be 0.30° ± 0.21°C [5 to 95% confidence interval (CI)] warmer than the observed value for 2004. Furthermore, at least half of the years after 2009 are predicted to be warmer than 1998, the warmest year currently on record.”\n\n \n\n However, now we are able to analyse the data on how temperatures really changed, we can see that there was actually a cooling of 0.014 degrees over the past 10 years, which is below even the lowest estimate.\n\n \n\n Also, not a single year was warmer than 1998, despite the paper predicting that at least three years would be.\n\n \n\n The above chart (credit: Kalte Sonne) shows the Met Office’s observed data (thin grey line) with the Smith et al predictions (red and blue lines) and the real trend (thick black line) overlaid. We can clearly see that not only does to real trend fall well outside the range of Smith et al’s predictions, it actually drops slightly.\n\n \n\n Writing for the German climate blog Die Kalte Sonne, scientist Frank Bosse says that the Smith et al study failed to take into account known ocean cycles and other natural factors.\n\n \n\n Smith has since written another paper, taking more factors into account, but Bosse writes that the range of uncertainty in it makes it “more or less useless”.\n\n \n\n In a translation by NoTricksZone, Bosse concludes:\n\n \n\n “As long as man is unable to determine with the needed precision the role natural variability plays in our observed climate, calculating the impact of greenhouse gases will remain prophecy. Do you feel guilty that you are still using incandescent light bulbs? Don’t fret over it!”\n\n \n\n [top]\n\n \n\n BBC rural affairs coverage 'has too many fluffy badgers'\n\n \n\n BBC's coverage of rural issues is squeamish, simplistic and has too many pictures of 'fluffy badgers'\n\n \n\n Anita Singh - Telegraph - 26th June 2014\n\n \n\n The BBC’s coverage of countryside issues is too “squeamish”, ignoring the gritty realities of rural life and favouring images of “fluffy badgers”, a report has found.\n\n \n\n There is a deficit in reporting on rural affairs, with important stories overlooked, according to the independent review commissioned by the BBC Trust.\n\n \n\n Issues of health, education and employment in rural areas are rarely covered, the report concluded, with the corporation preferring to focus on protests or animal stories with a “feelgood” ending.\n\n \n\n Coverage of the badger cull provoked the greatest anger amongst rural dwellers.\n\n \n\n The report noted: “The predominant use of images of healthy badgers to open or conclude a report was felt to weight the argument in favour of the anti-cull lobby. People asked where were the pictures of sick badgers with TB, or infected cows being shot, or a distraught farming family coming to terms with the loss of their animals.\n\n \n\n \"To some people, it felt like the images asked, 'Which do you like most: the cow or the badger?'\n\n \n\n “The audience research picked up criticism of the number of ‘fluffy badgers’ in pictures and said it was never going to result in an impartial impression in their opinion.\n\n \n\n “The emotional response of protesters was readily captured by reporters, but the same was not the case for farmers.”\n\n \n\n Farmers said \"it felt like the images asked, 'Which do you like most: the cow or the badger?'\"\n\n \n\n Farmers complained they had been portrayed as “villains”. Some said they had been reluctant to show their faces on television because they feared retribution from protesters. But one rural landowner remarked: “If it was some issue like female genital mutilation, [the BBC] would go to some effort to help the person speak – disguise voices and things like that.”\n\n \n\n The issue of “feelgood” reporting was mentioned in relation to a piece about snow on the Isle of Arran, where thousands of sheep died as a result of the terrible weather.\n\n \n\n It ended with a shot of a lamb in front of an Aga in Yorkshire.\n\n \n\n Mark Hedges, editor of Country Life, said coverage was often sanitised and “did the countryside a real disservice in the process”. He added: \"The BBC is incredibly squeamish about the countryside.\"\n\n \n\n The research found that the BBC’s use of celebrities to illustrate stories, such as Brian May discussing the badger cull, were not appreciated by rural audiences.\n\n \n\n “Celebrity contributions on controversial subjects were unwelcome. The audience found it irritating and perplexing.”\n\n \n\n The report was carried out by Heather Hancock, chair of the BBC’s rural affairs committee.\n\n \n\n She was full of praise for countryside programming outside the main news bulletins, applauding Countryfile, Farming Today and even The Archers, in addition to specials including Lambing Live and Springwatch. Viewers said they were impressed by pieces on BBC Breakfast and discussions on Jeremy Vine's Radio 2 show.\n\n \n\n Coverage in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is also impressive she said, and across the board the reporting was \"generally impartial\". However, she expressed “significant concerns” over coverage in England.\n\n \n\n “Audiences feel network news coverage can be simplistic and, on contentious stories, too often focused on protest rather than the underlying issues,” she said.\n\n \n\n “Concentrating on two extremes – a rose-tinted view or extreme hardship – was felt to obscure the gritty realities of rural life.\"\n\n \n\n On the issue of country pursuits, “many I spoke to felt there was a gulf in understanding between the BBC and a significant segment of the rural community”. Rural audiences detected \"a lack of understanding\" and a \"squeamishness\".\n\n \n\n Stories are “too often viewed through the lens of environmentalism”, and there is too narrow a range of voices on air with the RSPB, NFU and National Trust given a disproportionate amount of airtime.\n\n \n\n Audiences also perceive a metropolitan bias despite the fact that 12 million people live in the countryside – twice the population of London.\n\n \n\n One example given was last year’s flooding, with the BBC perceived by some to have ignored the issue until it reached the Thames Valley. In the words of one respondent: “It changed when the effluent met the affluent.”\n\n \n\n Julie Nelson, rural officer for the Church of England, said rural audiences were largely left out of the BBC's output: \"The countryside is only interesting when it's dramatic or beautiful - but the ordinary, everyday life isn't, I think, shown. When there's a murder, or floods, suddenly a village becomes news. You get the story and then it moves on.\"\n\n \n\n The research also found that those who live in metropolitan areas have little understanding or interest in rural affairs.\n\n \n\n According to the report: “Both in London and Glasgow, living in rural areas was seen as a lifestyle choice. In Glasgow it was largely seen as just a rather impractical lifestyle. In London, on the whole, it was seen as an inexplicably and baffling one.\n\n \n\n “One audience member taking part in the London group could not comprehend why anyone living in the countryside would even want a good broadband connection.”\n\n \n\n Responding to the Trust report, a BBC management spokesman said: \"We take our commitment to the reporting of rural affairs very seriously and welcome the report's endorsement of our programming and overall impartiality.\n\n \n\n \"Whilst the report finds overall we do a good job reflecting and reporting rural affairs, there are areas where we can do better and we have committed to a range of steps to help improve the coverage further.\"\n\n \n\n [top]\n\n \n\n North Korea claims to have tested precision guided missile \n\n Announcement comes after South Korea said it detected three short-range projectiles coming down in the Sea of Japan\n\n The Guardian - 27th June 2014 \n\n \n\n North Korea claims to have successfully tested a new precision guided missile, at the same time as its army threatens a \"devastating\" retaliation against South Korea for carrying out live fire drills near their maritime border.\n\n \n\n The launch was watched by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, according to the North's official KCNA news agency, which hailed the test as a breakthrough in national defence capability.\n\n \n\n North Korea is not known to possess a tactical guided missile but analysis of a recent propaganda film suggested it may have acquired a variant of a Russian cruise missile, the KH-35.\n\n \n\n KCNA did not specify the timing of the test but it appeared to coincide with the firing on Thursday of what South Korea described as three short-range projectiles into the Sea of Japan.\n\n \n\n The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North's ruling party, published pictures on Friday of the new missile being tested with Kim in attendance.\n\n \n\n South Korea's defence ministry related the latest test to Pyongyang's efforts to improve its large-calibre multiple rocket launching (MRL) systems. \"The MRL ranges have been extended and guidance capabilities added to the projectiles,\" spokesman Kim Min-Seok said.\n\n \n\n Washington said it was looking into the technical specifics to determine the threat level. \"Technically, obviously any launch of anything is problematic, is escalatory in nature, is threatening,\" said US state department spokeswoman Marie Harf.\n\n \n\n On Thursday the Korean People's Army (KPA) released a statement on KCNA condemning recent South Korean live fire exercises near their disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea.\n\n \n\n The South's defence ministry declined to confirm that any particular drills had taken place, but said routine exercises in the area of the maritime border were common.\n\n \n\n Yun Duk-Min, a professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul, said the development of a tactical guided missile would be an \"obvious military hazard\" to South Korea and the US bases it hosts.\n\n \n\n A precision weapon would also be a response to South Korea's home-grown development of a cruise missile that was displayed during a military parade in Seoul last October. According to the South's defence ministry the Hyeonmu 3's accuracy made it capable of striking the \"office window\" of the North's command headquarters in Pyongyang.\n\n \n\n Inter-Korean relations have been tense for some months following annual South Korea-US military exercises that Pyongyang regularly condemns as provocative rehearsals for invasion.\n\n \n\n Before the new missile test there had been hopes that the atmosphere was calming as the two sides held their first talks for six months on running their joint industrial zone in Kaesong.\n\n \n\n [top]\n\n \n\n Nigerian singer offers her virginity to Boko Haram in exchange for kidnapped schoolgirls \n\n • Adokiye says she wishes she could be exchanged for the schoolgirls\n\n Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, however said that the US plan was a step in the wrong direction. “I am sure that it is possible to spend it for something more useful,” he said.The National Security Council's spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the funding \"would build on the administration's long-standing efforts to empower the moderate Syrian opposition\".About $287m in mainly non-lethal support has been cleared for the rebels since March 2011, and the CIA has participated in a secret military training programme in neighbouring Jordan for the 'moderate' opposition.The $500m in aid is part of a proposed $1.5bn \"regional stabilisation initiative\" to bolster Syrian neighbours Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq, and to support communities hosting refugees.Hayden said US officials \"believe that there is no military solution to this crisis and that the United States should not put American troops into combat.\"But she said that the request for the rebels would help Syrians \"push back against the growing number of extremists like ISIL, who find safe-haven in the chaos, and take their future into their own hands by enhancing security and stability at local levels.\"Meanwhile the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has said he \"welcomed\" air attacks by Syria against ISIL targets on Iraqi soil, after raids on the border town of al-Qaim on Tuesday.Maliki told the BBC Arabic that Baghdad did not request the air raids.\"There was no coordination involved, but we welcome this action. We welcome any Syrian strike ... because this group targets both Iraq and Syria ... But we didn't make any request from Syria. They carry out their strikes and we carry out ours. The final winners are our two countries,\" he said in the BBC interview.Britain cannot \"educate the world\", a senior judge said as he rejected a bid by a Filipino family living in Kent to stay in the country so their children could recieve a good education.The family-of-five were challenging a ruling, denying them indefinite leave to remain in the UK, on the basis that it would be best for the three children.But Lord Justice Lewison and two senior colleagues said the best thing for them would be to stay with their parents, who have no right to stay in the country.\"I cannot see that the desirability of being educated at public expense in the UK can outweigh the benefit to the children of remaining with their parents,\" he said.\"Just as we cannot provide medical treatment for the world, so we cannot educate the world.\"The appeal court was rejecting a challenge by the mother to a decision by the Home Office immigration authorities, upheld by immigration tribunal judges, not to renew her family's permission to remain after her work permit ran out.Lawyers for the care home nurse, who for legal reasons can only be referred to as EV, launched a last-ditch argument that the best interests of her children and their education in the UK ranked above all immigration control considerations.They contended it would not be proportionate to send them back to the Philippines but would breach Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which safeguards the right to private and family life.Rejecting the argument, Lord Justice Lewison said \"in the real world\" parents relied on the bests interests of their children \"in order to piggy-back on their rights\".In EV's case, the mother had no right to remain in the UK, and the interests of the family members had to be considered \"in the light of the real world facts\".The judge said: \"In our case, none of the family is a British citizen. None has a right to remain in this country....\"If the parents are removed, then it is entirely reasonable to expect the children to go with them.\"The judge also observed that the immigration judge whose decision the court was upholding had weighed the best interests of the children without explicitly considering \"the cost to the public purse in providing education to these children\".He said the courts had ruled that the cost would have been an \"appropriate\" consideration.\"If anything, therefore, the immigration judge adopted an approach too favourable to the appellant.\"Lord Justice Clarke said EV was a skilled care worker who entered the UK with a work permit and was given permission to stay until February 2011.She worked at a care home in Kent and was joined by her husband, BV, in April 2008, and then by the couple's three children - a daughter now aged 15, a son aged 12 and daughter aged nine - in July 2009.EV's application for indefinite leave to remain was rejected by the Home Office immigration authorities, leading to a complex series of legal challenges involving the First Tier immigration tribunal and the Upper Tribunal.After losing her case against removal before both tribunals, the mother was given permission to test in the appeal court whether her children's rights not to have their education disrupted should take precedence.Lord Justice Clarke said EV's job did not involve the requisite level of skill and she was not earning enough to be allowed to remain in the country under the immigration rules.An immigration tribunal judge had accepted she had been defrauded and underpaid by the care home owner who employed her. She had not at first informed the Home Office authorities of this, but the issue had now been taken into consideration, and she was still being refused permission to remain.Lord Justice Clarke said the question for the appeal court was whether it would be \"proportionate\" to remove the children as they had received \"an excellent report\" from the deputy head of their school in Kent.All family members had formed friendships in their local community and it was in the best interests of the children that their education was not disrupted.But, said the judge, the education system in the Philippines was sufficiently good - EV herself had obtained an M.Sc degree in nursing there - and the children's interests did not outweigh the need for immigration control.EV and her husband would be employable in the Philippines. The family, which had only been in the UK for a limited time, would also have access to an extended family and not be homeless.The children would not be without education in the Philippines, although it would not be as good as in the UK and secondary education was not free in that country.Schoolchildren from white working-class homes should be entitled to the same kind of remedial language support as pupils who have English as a second language, because without extra help they are falling behind their foreign-speaking classmates, research has found.Some working-class children are arriving at school unable to recognise their own names, and need just as much help to allow them to communicate with their peers, a conference will be told today.“Members of staff felt that the school grants needed to be rethought as there is currently no money to support the language deficit within the white working-class community,” argues the study by Dr Feyisa Demie, head of research and statistics at Lambeth Council, and Dr Kirstin Lewis, from Goldsmith’s College.It said school ethnic minority achievement co-ordinators had found many students with English as a second language “are articulate by the time they reach Year 6 [the last year in primary school] due to the level of support they have had”.“Furthermore, many schools reflected on the fact that pupils with English as an additional language [EAL] needs arriving new to a school receive a thorough induction process,” it added.But when it came to white working-class pupils, the co-ordinators said their “hands were tied and that, as much as some white working-class pupils needed specific language support to progress and access the curriculum, they were not in a position to give this support”.One told researchers: “I was with some children the other day in a classroom – it was the EAL children who had the necessary comparative language: bigger, biggest. The white children did not have the vocabulary.”The report added: “Governors believe the current system of additional funding means some schools serving white working-class estates do not receive adequate financial support... The consequences of an ability to express oneself either verbally or in writing can lead to low self-esteem and often aggression.”One primary school teacher said: “Many of the white children, as do others, come into school well below average; they haven’t got the skills; they can’t recognise their own name.”The report is due to be presented at a conference at London University’s Institute for Education today.It confirmed the findings of a Commons Select Committee on Education report last week in which MPs revealed that white working-class pupils were the poorest performers of any ethnic group in exams and tests.Professor Alan Smithers, head of the Centre for Education and Employment at Buckingham University, said: “We tend to provide very good tuition for students who come from abroad. There is a whole profession build up around English as a second language, but really English is to some extent a second language to a lot of young people born in this country.“One of the ways of raising the performance of white working-class pupils is to give them help as if English was a foreign language.”In contrast to today’s findings, black pupils are now the fastest improving ethnic group after years languishing as the poorest performers as The Independent revealed yesterday.Dr Tony Sewell, who founded the charity Generating Genius – set up to help disadvantaged black youths but now widened in scope to cover white working-class pupils as well – said: “A child from a West African background that is lower middle-class might better be able to access English than a white working-class boy on an estate.”Today’s report also concluded that social deprivation and housing conditions play their part in limiting the achievements of white-working class pupils.“One of the main reasons for pupil underachievement is a perceived lack of aspiration amongst parents for their children’s future and a lack of engagement in their schooling”, it said.One headteacher told the authors: “Many of our parents are young, with a legacy of hostility to school.”Another teacher added that white working-class parents did not “possess the immigrant mentality”.The report concluded that “The main obstacle in raising achievement is the Government’s failure to recognise that this group has particular needs that are not being met by the school system.”However, the Government argues that – with its “pupil premium” giving schools extra cash to take in disadvantaged pupils – schools now have the wherewithal to deal with underperformance.Iraqi insurgents executed at least 160 captives earlier this month in the northern city of Tikrit, Human Rights Watch has said, citing an analysis of satellite imagery and grisly photosgraphs released by the militants.The US-based group said militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) killed between 160 and 190 men in two locations in Tikrit between 11-14 June.\"The number of victims may well be much higher, but the difficulty of locating bodies and accessing the area has prevented a full investigation,\" it said.After overrunning large swaths of northern Iraq and capturing the cities of Mosul and Tikrit earlier this month, the Islamic extremist group posted graphic photos on a militant website that appeared to show fighters loading dozens of captured soldiers on to flatbed trucks before forcing them to lie in a shallow ditch with their hands tied behind their backs. A final set of photos shows what appear to be dead bodies.\"The photos and satellite images from Tikrit provide strong evidence of a horrible war crime that needs further investigation,\" Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. The militants \"apparently executed at the very least 160 people in Tikrit\".Chief Iraqi military spokesman Lt Gen Qassim al-Moussawi confirmed the photos' authenticity after they surfaced on 15 June and said he was aware of cases of mass murder of captured Iraqi soldiers in areas held by Isis.He said at the time that an examination of the images by military experts showed that about 170 soldiers were shot to death by the militants after their capture.Captions on the photos showing the soldiers after they were shot say \"hundreds have been liquidated\", but the total could not immediately be verified.The massacre appeared to be aimed at instilling fear in Iraq's demoralised armed forces – which melted away as militants seized much of the north in a matter of days – as well as the country's Shia majority, whom Isis views as apostates.Human Rights Watch said its analysis of the photos showed two trenches in the same location, and that using satellite imagery from 2013 and publicly available photos taken earlier it was able to pinpoint the execution site in a field near a former palace of late dictator Saddam Hussein next to the Tigris river.It said satellite imagery of the site from 16 June did not reveal bodies but showed indications of vehicles and earth movement consistent with the two shallow trenches visible in the photos.Sergei Glazyev’s comments came shortly before the Ukrainian president signed the full association agreement at the EU summit in Brussels amid a precarious ceasefire between government troops and pro-Russian rebels.Mr Glazyev, Mr Putin's presidential adviser on regional economic integration, also described Mr Poroshenko’s endorsement of the deal as “illegitimate” and accused Europe of attempting to push Ukraine to sign the agreement, which is expected to take place later today “by force”.He told the BBC: \"They organised [a] military coup in Ukraine, they helped Nazis to come to power. This Nazi government is bombing the largest region in Ukraine.\"When asked if he believed Mr Poroshenko was a Nazi, he replied \"of course\", adding: \"I think after the signing of the agreement with EU, [the] European public will be... surprised when this Nazi Frankenstein, which was born by the Euro bureaucrats and some politicians, will knock on the European countries' doors.\"His inflammatory remarks follow news that four members of the Vienna-based Organisation for the Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) had been released in what Alexander Borodai, head of the Donetsk People's Republic, claimed was part of a goodwill gesture.\"We don't expect anything in return - we freed them without any pre-conditions,\" he said.The OSCE said four other members were also kidnapped by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine a month ago. Spokesman Steffen Seibert said leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France had agreed on Wednesday in a telephone call that the hostages should be freed without delay.Thousands of Ukrainians are reported to have lined up at the border with cars stuffed with their belongings to cross into Russia as the shaky cease fire entered its final hours today.Russia claims tens of thousands of Ukrainians have come in the two-and-a-half months since Ukraine's government began fighting separatists in the east, a heavily industrial region with a large population of ethnic Russians, many of whom feel strong ties to Moscow.Air strikes and artillery attacks by the Ukrainian military have infuriated many residents. Many crossing the border said they were fleeing the fighting, which has killed more than 400 people since mid-April by the United Nations' estimate.Talks to possibly extend the truce in Donetsk and Luhansk are set to take place on Friday. It will be the second round of talks since Monday in which the rebel leaders have participated.Mr Poroshenko has urged Russia to support his peace plan \"with deeds, not words\" a call echoed by the US Secretary of State John Kerry ahead of the summit of EU leaders, who will be considering a new round of sanctions against Russia.The BBC's flagship politics programme Newsnight is made by \"13-year-olds\", its former hosthas said, as he suggests his Conservative leanings made him a lone voice on the show.Paxman, who made his last appearance on the flagship BBC programme earlier this month, said the makers of the programme were still young idealists, wanting to \"change the world\".He added his experience in politics had led him to be a \"one-nation Tory\", with youthful idealism being a \"fools' errand\".Speaking at the Chalke Valley History Festival, about his book on the First World War, he answered questions from the audience about his memorable tandem bike ride through the streets of London with Boris Johnson, which featured on the final programme.Footage broadcast on Newsnight saw the Mayor of London call Paxman the \"last\" one-nation Tory working at the BBC.\"I have to be frank, I suppose I am a one-nation Tory, yes,\" Paxman admitted. \"Look, Newsnight is made by 13-year-olds. It's perfectly normal when you're young that you want to change the world.\"The older you get, the more you realise what a fools' errand much of that is and that the thing to do is to manage the best you can to the advantage of as many people as possible.\"Paxman, who has had to be politically impartial throughout his journalism career, added of the interview: \"It's complete b------s, of course, typical Boris.\"On the question of whether he truly was the last Conservative at the BBC, he began to answer before stopping himself.\"If I had to...are there any members of the press here?\" he said, at the sold-out event. \"I think I'll plead the fifth on that one.\"His comments may be viewed by critics of the BBC as giving an insight into recent years at Newsnight, which has been plagued by mistakes made during the Savile scandal and accusations of \"dumbing down\".Paxman's latter encounters include an interview with comedian Russell Brand, while his colleague Kirsty Wark performed a dance to Michael Jackson's Thriller and Emily Maitlis interviewed the Cookie Monster.Its new editor, Ian Katz, joined from the Guardian newspaper a year ago.The public event also saw Paxman share his opinion of modern politics, saying: \"I am in favour of governments getting out of people's lives. Particularly foreign government.\"The closer you can take decision-making to the people affected by those decisions, the better.\"Europe, he said, had been the source of \"nothing but trouble for us\", and joked Belgium as a \"pointless little country\".When asked if he had relaxed his rule about never drinking before a show for his final appearance, he said: \"\"No I didn't have a drink beforehand, but perhaps I should have done.\"Paxman, who spent 25 years working on Newsnight, will continue to work for the BBC as the presenter of University Challenge, and is due to appear in a one-man show at the Edinburgh Festival this summer.His book, Britain's Great War, is out now.Go to the Bukit Timah Shopping Centre, a 1970s mall in central Singapore, and you will find five levels of brightly lit rooms and galleries called \"Homekeeper\" and \"Budget Maid\". Inside these rooms, dozens of women sit in a listless, artificial silence. They nod respectfully as you enter, and some watch closely as you speak to staff. You might take one home with you - for two years, or longer.The women, domestic workers, come from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Myanmar. They sit beneath garish signs and posters, testifying to their friendliness and industriousness, or advertising \"super promo\" rates and \"special discounts\".Some \"maid agencies\", as they're known locally, display women at work. Along one aisle, domestic workers push each other around in wheelchairs, as though they're taking care of the elderly. In another gallery, a woman cradles a baby doll and pretends to change its diapers. Others stand in mock living rooms ironing the same shirt, or making the same bed - scenes enacted elsewhere in Singapore at malls like Katong Shopping Centre on Mountbatten Road.Jolovan Wham, executive director of the Humanitarian Organisation of Migration Economics (HOME), a migrant workers advocacy group based in Singapore, said that some agencies market their domestic workers like \"commodities\". He adds that racial stereotypes are sometimes used in transactions with patrons. \"Some of the stereotypes include Filipinos as 'smarter', Indonesians as 'less bright' and Burmese as 'sweet-natured and compliant'.\"There have also been complaints of women being underfed at certain employment agencies, according to Ummai Ummairoh, president of the Indonesian Family Network (IFN). \"We always receive calls about agencies not giving enough food. In one case, an agency was spending $20 to feed 40 people.\"Ummairoh, who also worked as a maid, added that the shopping centres made women look like \"dolls at a supermarket\".For Anandha Nurul, a domestic worker who spent seven years in Singapore, her time at the shopping malls was marked by boredom and long hours. \"They did not treat me very nicely,\" she said, recalling that she was fed instant noodles for the three days she was at her agency. \"We didn't even boil the noodles properly. We just used warm water.\"But standards vary considerably within the industry, and other agencies claim to afford female domestic workers more dignified conditions. \"We should be fair and treat these workers as human beings,\" said Dawn Sng of PrimeChoice Maid Agency, who claims that her agency provides domestic workers with in-house training, free meals, and counselling. \"We should not put them into a lower category of people.\"Bukit Timah and other shopping centres like it are the culmination of networks and organisations extending from Singapore to various parts of Southeast Asia: from brokers who recruit women from poor countries, to training centres that prepare women for life abroad, to \"runners\" who ferry domestic workers from airports to shopping centres, and finally to the employment agencies themselves, of which there are hundreds in Singapore, competing in what is effectively a multimillion dollar industry. Wham says that there are currently 215,000 domestic workers in Singapore.We have continually advocated that the 'live-in' requirement is unsatisfactory because it easily leads to abuse.- Shelley Thio, Transient Workers Count TooFor most women, according to Wham, the shopping centres are fleeting experiences that last no longer than a week. Before coming to Singapore, most domestic workers have already found their employers after a phone or webcam interview from their home countries. The malls are essentially transition points, and the women are soon sent to their employers after completing a \"settling-in programme\" and a mandatory heath check.But some maids return to the malls and can end up staying there for as long as a month. In the language of employment agencies, these women are \"transfer maids\", and have either been released by their original employers, or have requested to leave after experiencing problems at work.Shelley Thio, executive member of Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), attributes most problems to \"working conditions\", and cites verbal abuse, non-payment of wages, and excessive work hours as among the most common reasons domestic workers request formal transfers.Thio also raised concerns over Singapore's \"live-in\" requirement, by which a full-time domestic worker is legally obliged to live in the home of her employer.\"We have continually advocated that the live-in requirement is unsatisfactory because it easily leads to abuse,\" Thio said, adding that some women become vulnerable because of the removal of mobile phones, which isolates them from friends and organisations such as HOME and TWC2.The live-in requirement can leave women vulnerable to sexual abuse. Earlier this year, a Cambodian domestic worker was sexually harassed by her employer's father, with whom she was made to share a room. Although the woman had complained about this arrangement, both to her employers and employment agency, nothing was done to change her situation prior to the abuse.Problems in Singapore are sometimes compounded by unscrupulous practises and weak oversight in the female workers' underdeveloped home countries. In Indonesian training centres, for instance, women commonly complain that dormitories are overcrowded and that they are not given enough food, according to Wahyu Susilo of the advocacy group Migrant Care.\"We are always finding migrant workers in cramped rooms and living with poor sanitary conditions. In one case we found 200 migrant workers sharing two or three toilets.\"He adds that monitoring by the Indonesian government is generally weak, which has led to exploitative conditions at a number of centres, including unreasonable fees and deceptive recruitment practises.In some cases, monitoring of training centres in originating countries is limited due to corruption. According to the managing director of one centre in Indonesia, who spoke to Al Jazeera on the condition of anonymity, local police accept bribes from the training centres they are tasked with inspecting.Most domestic workers who come to Singapore have large debts in the form of placement fees paid to agencies as monthly salary deductions.Thio at TWC2 said that she has come across instances where domestic workers end up owing $4,500 to their agencies, adding that the average debts women accumulate are between $2,500 and $3,000.\"High placement fees are charged to the worker because the agencies can get away with it,\" according to Wham, who said that some agencies disguise these fees as \"loans\".\"The worker pays these fees because she feels that she doesn't have a choice. And our laws do not make it mandatory for employers to bear the bulk of the fees.\"Some domestic maids also work in Singapore illegally. A number of women are employed even though they are underage, according to Thio, and some will be brought into the country under conditions indicative of trafficking.But at shopping centres, where clients stroll past \"Homekeeper\" and \"Budget Maid\", and where domestic workers continue their unending simulation of household work, little of this is expressed or known.\"I watched all those things\", recounts Istiana, an Indonesian domestic worker who has recently come to work in Singapore. \"Those signs that say 'cheap price' and 'discount maid'. But these are people,\" she added.A UK Met Office study that predicted temperatures would rise by up to half a degree centigrade over the past 10 years faces ridicule after it was revealed that temperatures actually dropped over that period.The peer-reviewed study by Doug M. Smith et al, entitled “Improved Surface Temperature Prediction for the Coming Decade from a Global Climate Model” – and which featured in the journal Science – also incorrectly predicted that several years over the past decade would see record heat.The paper says:However, now we are able to analyse the data on how temperatures really changed, we can see that there was actually a cooling of 0.014 degrees over the past 10 years, which is below even the lowest estimate.Also, not a single year was warmer than 1998, despite the paper predicting that at least three years would be.The above chart (credit: Kalte Sonne) shows the Met Office’s observed data (thin grey line) with the Smith et al predictions (red and blue lines) and the real trend (thick black line) overlaid. We can clearly see that not only does to real trend fall well outside the range of Smith et al’s predictions, it actually drops slightly.Writing for the German climate blog Die Kalte Sonne, scientist Frank Bosse says that the Smith et al study failed to take into account known ocean cycles and other natural factors.Smith has since written another paper, taking more factors into account, but Bosse writes that the range of uncertainty in it makes it “more or less useless”.In a translation by NoTricksZone, Bosse concludes:The BBC’s coverage of countryside issues is too “squeamish”, ignoring the gritty realities of rural life and favouring images of “fluffy badgers”, a report has found.There is a deficit in reporting on rural affairs, with important stories overlooked, according to the independent review commissioned by the BBC Trust.Issues of health, education and employment in rural areas are rarely covered, the report concluded, with the corporation preferring to focus on protests or animal stories with a “feelgood” ending.Coverage of the badger cull provoked the greatest anger amongst rural dwellers.The report noted: “The predominant use of images of healthy badgers to open or conclude a report was felt to weight the argument in favour of the anti-cull lobby. People asked where were the pictures of sick badgers with TB, or infected cows being shot, or a distraught farming family coming to terms with the loss of their animals.\"To some people, it felt like the images asked, 'Which do you like most: the cow or the badger?'“The audience research picked up criticism of the number of ‘fluffy badgers’ in pictures and said it was never going to result in an impartial impression in their opinion.“The emotional response of protesters was readily captured by reporters, but the same was not the case for farmers.”Farmers said \"it felt like the images asked, 'Which do you like most: the cow or the badger?'\"Farmers complained they had been portrayed as “villains”. Some said they had been reluctant to show their faces on television because they feared retribution from protesters. But one rural landowner remarked: “If it was some issue like female genital mutilation, [the BBC] would go to some effort to help the person speak – disguise voices and things like that.”The issue of “feelgood” reporting was mentioned in relation to a piece about snow on the Isle of Arran, where thousands of sheep died as a result of the terrible weather.It ended with a shot of a lamb in front of an Aga in Yorkshire.Mark Hedges, editor of Country Life, said coverage was often sanitised and “did the countryside a real disservice in the process”. He added: \"The BBC is incredibly squeamish about the countryside.\"The research found that the BBC’s use of celebrities to illustrate stories, such as Brian May discussing the badger cull, were not appreciated by rural audiences.“Celebrity contributions on controversial subjects were unwelcome. The audience found it irritating and perplexing.”The report was carried out by Heather Hancock, chair of the BBC’s rural affairs committee.She was full of praise for countryside programming outside the main news bulletins, applauding Countryfile, Farming Today and even The Archers, in addition to specials including Lambing Live and Springwatch. Viewers said they were impressed by pieces on BBC Breakfast and discussions on Jeremy Vine's Radio 2 show.Coverage in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is also impressive she said, and across the board the reporting was \"generally impartial\". However, she expressed “significant concerns” over coverage in England.“Audiences feel network news coverage can be simplistic and, on contentious stories, too often focused on protest rather than the underlying issues,” she said.“Concentrating on two extremes – a rose-tinted view or extreme hardship – was felt to obscure the gritty realities of rural life.\"On the issue of country pursuits, “many I spoke to felt there was a gulf in understanding between the BBC and a significant segment of the rural community”. Rural audiences detected \"a lack of understanding\" and a \"squeamishness\".Stories are “too often viewed through the lens of environmentalism”, and there is too narrow a range of voices on air with the RSPB, NFU and National Trust given a disproportionate amount of airtime.Audiences also perceive a metropolitan bias despite the fact that 12 million people live in the countryside – twice the population of London.One example given was last year’s flooding, with the BBC perceived by some to have ignored the issue until it reached the Thames Valley. In the words of one respondent: “It changed when the effluent met the affluent.”Julie Nelson, rural officer for the Church of England, said rural audiences were largely left out of the BBC's output: \"The countryside is only interesting when it's dramatic or beautiful - but the ordinary, everyday life isn't, I think, shown. When there's a murder, or floods, suddenly a village becomes news. You get the story and then it moves on.\"The research also found that those who live in metropolitan areas have little understanding or interest in rural affairs.According to the report: “Both in London and Glasgow, living in rural areas was seen as a lifestyle choice. In Glasgow it was largely seen as just a rather impractical lifestyle. In London, on the whole, it was seen as an inexplicably and baffling one.“One audience member taking part in the London group could not comprehend why anyone living in the countryside would even want a good broadband connection.”Responding to the Trust report, a BBC management spokesman said: \"We take our commitment to the reporting of rural affairs very seriously and welcome the report's endorsement of our programming and overall impartiality.\"Whilst the report finds overall we do a good job reflecting and reporting rural affairs, there are areas where we can do better and we have committed to a range of steps to help improve the coverage further.\"North Korea claims to have successfully tested a new precision guided missile, at the same time as its army threatens a \"devastating\" retaliation against South Korea for carrying out live fire drills near their maritime border.The launch was watched by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, according to the North's official KCNA news agency, which hailed the test as a breakthrough in national defence capability.North Korea is not known to possess a tactical guided missile but analysis of a recent propaganda film suggested it may have acquired a variant of a Russian cruise missile, the KH-35.KCNA did not specify the timing of the test but it appeared to coincide with the firing on Thursday of what South Korea described as three short-range projectiles into the Sea of Japan.The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North's ruling party, published pictures on Friday of the new missile being tested with Kim in attendance.South Korea's defence ministry related the latest test to Pyongyang's efforts to improve its large-calibre multiple rocket launching (MRL) systems. \"The MRL ranges have been extended and guidance capabilities added to the projectiles,\" spokesman Kim Min-Seok said.Washington said it was looking into the technical specifics to determine the threat level. \"Technically, obviously any launch of anything is problematic, is escalatory in nature, is threatening,\" said US state department spokeswoman Marie Harf.On Thursday the Korean People's Army (KPA) released a statement on KCNA condemning recent South Korean live fire exercises near their disputed maritime border in the Yellow Sea.The South's defence ministry declined to confirm that any particular drills had taken place, but said routine exercises in the area of the maritime border were common.Yun Duk-Min, a professor at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul, said the development of a tactical guided missile would be an \"obvious military hazard\" to South Korea and the US bases it hosts.A precision weapon would also be a response to South Korea's home-grown development of a cruise missile that was displayed during a military parade in Seoul last October. According to the South's defence ministry the Hyeonmu 3's accuracy made it capable of striking the \"office window\" of the North's command headquarters in Pyongyang.Inter-Korean relations have been tense for some months following annual South Korea-US military exercises that Pyongyang regularly condemns as provocative rehearsals for invasion.Before the new missile test there had been hopes that the atmosphere was calming as the two sides held their first talks for six months on running their joint industrial zone in Kaesong.• Adokiye says she wishes she could be exchanged for the schoolgirls That she would sleep with 10-12 men a night if she had to\n\n \n\n Steve Hopkins - Daily Mail - 27th June 2014 \n\n \n\n A Nigerian pop singer and peace ambassador has sent shock waves across social media by offering her virginity to Islamic militants in exchange for the return of hundreds of kidknapped schoolgirls.

These were sent out to different camps for intensive military training on the use of various weapons, guerilla warfare, kidnapping, as well as rigging vehicles with explosives for later terrorist operations.\n\n \n\n The sources said Moroccan jihadists in Syria were being trained to execute suicide attacks in their home country.\n\n \n\n The cell was luring Moroccans from the cities of Fez and Taza in central Morocco.\n\n \n\n In terms of funding, the cell depended on direct assistance from six of its executive members who dealt in smuggling for additional funds in order to send fighters to Syria.\n\n \n\n The cell also collected money from the jihadist Salafist movement in Fez and from sympathizers from the northwest of the country.\n\n \n\n In an unprecedented statement, Ahmad Toufi, the minister of Islamic Affairs, revealed that there was “perfect coordination between the religious and security authorities” on the matter of the Moroccan fighters in Syria.\n\n \n\n The youngest member of the cell was allegedly a high-school student aged 17.\n\n \n\n Other members included a spare parts vendor for cars aged 30, a medical sales representative aged 34, a goldsmith aged 38, an unemployed man aged 39, and an Imam 34 who is a former detainee who has been previously charged in terrorism cases.\n\n \n\n [top]\n\n \n\n Frustrated Libyans vote amid violence \n\n Nils Naumann - Deutsche Welle - 27th June 2014\n\n \n\n Moammar Gadhafi brutalized the Libyan people for more than forty years. Now they are about to elect a new parliament for the second time since his fall. Enthusiasm is limited.\n\n \n\n Wednesday (25.06.2014) was a hot day in the Libyan capital Tripoli: 44 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit) in the shade. But Mohammed Akila went out to vote anyway.\n\n \n\n \"The Libyans want security, stability, and a well-run state, like the rest of the developed world,\" he said. Akila hopes that electing a new parliament will help to achieve that.\n\n \n\n Munira Ashour, a teacher, has also cast her ballot. \"I voted so that we can build Libya up again.\"\n\n \n\n But Akila and Ashour are in a minority. It was already clear ahead of the election that people's expectations of politics had dropped significantly. Only 1.5 million of the 3.4 million Libyans have registered to vote. At the first election of the General National Congress two years ago, it was 2.7 million.\n\n \n\n This time, according to the electoral commission, 630,000 Libyans cast their vote on Wednesday - not even half of those who registered. The commission blamed the hot weather - but that can only partially explain Libyans' reluctance.\n\n \n\n Many people are frustrated. Three years after the fall of dictator Moammar Gadhafi, the country has fallen into a vortex of violence and political power games. Vote counting is currently underway, and first results are expected soon.\n\n \n\n The security situation is so tense that polling stations in certain regions were not even opened. According to official statements, this happened in the eastern city of Darnah, a center for Islamists, al-Kufra in the southeast, the scene of regular battles between tribal militias, and the southern city of Sabha.\n\n \n\n The revolutionaries, divided among themselves, have not succeeded in forming a functioning democracy in a country that for decades was under an authoritarian regime. A new, democratically legitimate power structure was supposed to be put in place in spring 2013, but Libyans are still waiting for the constitution that they voted for by referendum to be implemented.\n\n \n\n The United Nations urged the parliamentary elections to take place as soon as possible, in the hope that this would prevent another escalation of violence. \"These elections are an important step in Libya's transformation to a stable democracy,\" the UN Security Council declared this week.\n\n \n\n The interim parliament's mandate ran out in February. When parliamentarians tried to extend their tenure until December, there were street protests, with people accusing the parliamentarians of tolerating Islamist militias and being obsessed with internal divisions.\n\n \n\n Militia power\n\n Mattia Toaldo, Libya expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), thinks the parliamentary elections are little more than a partial solution to the crisis in Libya. Much more important would be to find a consensus between all the different power factions in the country. The power in Libya, he says, doesn't lie in the parliament, but with the various militia leaders - and they mainly pursue their own interests.\n\n \n\n Following Gadhafi's fall, hardly any of the militias gave up their weapons. According to the International Crisis Group, around 125,000 of the approximately six million Libyans are still armed, and the central government and the official army are still too weak to offer the militias any resistance.\n\n \n\n Libyan political scientist Salem Soltan fears that the new parliamentarians do not have the necessary political weight to change the situation in the country. The risk is too great that warlords and militia chiefs will continue to hold the reins of power in the future.\n\n \n\n Enemies of balance\n\n A lot of the warlords, says Toaldo, have absolutely no interest in a peaceful solution to the power struggle. One example would be retired Major General Khalifa Haftar, who is currently conducting military operations against Islamist forces in the port town of Benghazi in eastern Libya.\n\n \n\n \"These forces don't believe in talks or power-sharing,\" Toaldo said. \"They believe they can win the upper hand militarily.\"\n\n \n\n On the other hand, extremist groups like Ansar al-Sharia aren't known for their great love of democracy either. The threat of a civil war is great in eastern Libya.\n\n \n\n And yet it is still too early to suggest that the \"Arab Spring\" has failed, according to Toaldo.\n\n \"It's a transitional process and we still don't know where it will end,\" he said. \"We shouldn't forget how destructive 42 years of Gadhafi's reign were.\"\n\n \n\n The country has no institutions, no parties, no independent media, no civil society. All that takes time, he says.\n\n \n\n \"What Libya does have is natural resources. And I don't just mean oil, but also the large, well-educated, and dynamic diaspora. So we should remain optimistic.\"\n\n \n\n You can read \n\n \n\n [top]\n\n That she would sleep with 10-12 men a night if she had toA Nigerian pop singer and peace ambassador has sent shock waves across social media by offering her virginity to Islamic militants in exchange for the return of hundreds of kidknapped schoolgirls., 23, made the proposal to Boko Haram members to help free the 276 Nigerian girls which they snatched in April from the largely Christian north-eastern town of Chibok.The singer and actress from the country's Imo State told Nigerian newspaper Vanguard: 'This is 11pm in the night and do you know what I am thinking about?

But a decision this week by India’s government to ratify a related, long-delayed, international protocol offers some hope. The 2008 agreement was opposed both by the left (Communists) and right (the Bharatiya Janata Party or BJP, then in opposition), furious at such cosying up to America.

Meanwhile, the Kim Jong Un government has initiated a process of economic opening up and tentative diplomatic engagement. These two realities call for the EU to focus on two areas on which it has the potential to have considerable impact – WMD non-proliferation activities and economic reform support. The EU’s approach should include both carrots and sticks. Mixing proactive and punitive measures would not undermine Brussels’ normative agenda or support for peace and security in the Korean Peninsula. On the contrary, the EU could be perceived in East Asia as an independent and engaged actor with strong knowledge of regional dynamics and willing to engage when necessary.\n\nAgenda for nuclear diplomacy\n\n Rakesh Sood for the Hindu\n\nOn June 22, the Narendra Modi government announced that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Additional Protocol had been ratified. It is a welcome step marking the new government’s foray into nuclear diplomacy. However, by itself, it will not pave the way to the successful conclusion of negotiations with Westinghouse or GE or, for that matter, even AREVA. For that, more initiatives need to be taken, particularly if progress on the nuclear issue is to be registered during the Prime Minister’s visit to Washington.",

capture videos of yourself snowboarding scuba diving parasailing and more pick up the new quikpod sport japans collective selfdefense just what is north korea doing and china faces large protests these stories and more are on the july 4th edition of asia news weekly welcome to asia news weekly im your host steve miller before we begin with this weeks digest id like to welcome our new listeners from asia pundits i hope youll enjoy the podcast and share your thoughts and opinions this week our first story is from japan japans collective selfdefense since the end of the second world war japan has operated under what many have called a pacifist constitution previous administrations interpreted elements of article 9 to mean japan could not carry out military operations abroad the world has changed a lot since 1945 and when current japanese prime minister shinzo abe came into office he made known his intention to lift that barrier abes original plan was to change the nations constitution to rewrite the provision in article 9 however there was insufficient support for that effort he shifted gears and worked with cabinet members to reinterpret the article to allow for collective selfdefense an inherent right given to all sovereign nations andrew horvat a visiting professor at josai international university in chiba who researches postwar reconciliation in europe and asia said a lot of japanese people think its article 9 that has brought them peace people identify with this and its difficult to suddenly accept the idea that peace is purchased at a price ― and that price is vigilance and vigilance requires armed forces or a credible response to countries that dont buy into the idea of peace horvart makes an excellent point many opposed to the notion of reinterpreting the article only look at one provision the ability to deploy troops abroad however whats been often overlooked and what the abe administration did a poor job of explaining was how limiting the provisions were in protecting japanese citizens in the face of increased piracy in south east asia and chinas expansion in the china sea tuesday abe announced the cabinet agreed to revise its understanding of article 9 and allow a policy change by improving deterrence and contributing more to regional and global peace and stability i believe we can better assure japans own peace and security abe said tuesday in tokyo we will continue to defend the pacifism contained in the constitution there will be absolutely no change to the path of peace japan has walked since the war instead this will make that path even more certain the united states has been fervent supporter of the change when abe made the announcement us defense secretary chuck hagel said it would make more effective the working relationship between the us and japan this decision is an important step for japan as it seeks to make a greater contribution to regional and global peace and security the new policy also complements our ongoing efforts to modernize our alliance through the revision of our bilateral guidelines for defense cooperation while japans allies may be applauding the change all is not well domestically as opposition to the change came to a head this week june 29 th a man selfimmolated while sitting atop a pedestrian bridge in shinjuku a central part of tokyo he was sitting cross legged and was just talking so i thought it would end without incident he was yelling against the government about collective selfdefense but when i came back to the same place 30 minutes later he was still there then all of a sudden his body was enveloped in fire said ryuichiro nakatsu who witnessed the incident thousands even protested outside the office of prime minister abe on monday demanding the plan to reinterpret article 9 be abandoned protect the constitution they shouted stop war stop abe abe quit right now yoshifu arita from the democratic party of japan joined the protesters calling the cabinets decision a coup attempt its a sentiment echoed by ryo irie from kyushu i heard a lot from my grandfather about the war how he was in manchuria and his superiors killed chinese people i learned about the importance of article 9 through those tragic stories the constitution is supposed to be a means for the people to restrain the government abe is trying to overturn that completely this plan is a coup detat against the japanese people recent polls including some as recent as wednesday place more than half the population against the policy shift darthjf commented on our wednesday asia now podcast i think japan has a right to collective selfdefense like any other country but abe is just arbitrarily changing the interpretation of constitution with a cabinet decision in a democracy there are procedures that you should follow and i dont think the abe cabinet simply going around them is good for democracy in japan many others simply asked why do you want to make war japan in korea which has strongly opposed the move protesters outside the japanese embassy said the move was tantamount to declaring a return to militarism national assembly floor leader lee onekoo said japan is walking on a path deviating from what normal countries should do in the 21st century china for its part also chimed in due to historical reasons the policy move of japan in the fields of military and security has been highly watched by its asian neighbors and the international community said chinas foreign ministry spokesman hong lei he continued we also noted some strong opposition within japan against the right to exercise collective selfdefense we oppose japans move of deliberately fabricating the threat of china so as to serve its domestic political purposes south koreas president park geunhye said korea should not view japans decision too emotionally korea should receive japans promise that it will not adopt policies of militarism or territorial expansion in the future pentagon spokesman rear admiral john kirby now there is a lot of work left to do inside the japanese government on this on this policy change that theyre seeking its a democracy theyve got a diet that needs to vote on this i mean theres a lot of work left to do we frankly think its a very encouraging sign and will help inform the revision of the defense guidelines a bilateral defense guidelines that we have with japan so it helps inform that process which as you know is ongoing so for us we find it very very helpful and there is not going to be there is no reason from our perspective to believe or to worry that it would that itd make tensions worse and quite the contrary we think it will help with security and stability in the region kirbys right so is abe in pushing for the change what everyone has done is do a bad job of selling it too many are focusing on the troop deployment and combat aspects of the policy shift which is important but not whats driving abe if a submarine say from china enters japanese waters the sdf can do virtually nothing if pirates highjack a ship with japanese citizens japan cant take any action to rescue them and must rely on another nation collective selfdefense isnt about raging war its about protecting yourself the limits on the previous interpretation would be analogous to a bully pushing you around in school and being unable to respond because your hands were tied behind your back just because one can lift a rifle and fire a shot doesnt mean one choses to do so leaving article 9 the way it was also wont prevent other elements from taking shots at japan the world has evolved since the creation of the sdf and so must it besides without collective selfdefense how long do you think the united states would be willing to be japans defender defense partner yes but not the strong arm of the nation this divisive issue is sure to grip japan for months to come and i welcome your comments on the subject listen to mondays asia now of one residents view and concern about the policy shift later updates from thailand as the junta moves forward with its plan to restore democracy sources asia now asia news weekly korea

visit with south korean president park geunhye its the first time in twenty years a sitting chinese leader has visited south korea before visiting the north and that may be the reason behind the dprks sudden onslaught of missile launches and other inflammatory remarks towards their southern neighbor last week the command of the southwestern front of the north korean peoples army said south korea committed such a grave military provocation as firing shells at the waters of the dprk side when it carried out a livefire drills near the countrys border islands in the yellow sea including yeonpyeong which was the scene of a deadly shelling in 2010 the following day north korea announced a successful test of a new highprecision tactical guided missile its not believed that north korea has such a weapon but has probably obtained a missile similar to the russian kh35 south korea detected three missiles fired into the east seasea of japan technically obviously any launch of anything is problematic is escalatory in nature is threatening said us state department spokeswoman marie harf north korea then fired more missiles on the 28 th of june those appeared to be scud class mediumrange missiles the dprk is prohibited from firing such weapons under un sanctions michael miner a scholar at harvard university and a fellow with pacific forum of the center for strategic and international studies said the launch was a show of strength unpredictability and instability is so critical to playing a strong hand for the leadership they are pushing the peace and stability angle to remind everyone things can stay as is or relatively stable but if that balance is upset in any way heres what we could do if we wanted at the drop of a hat again the actions were nothing more than kim jongun trying to grab headlines stay relevant and act out as xis south korean visit approached something he proved when on july 2 nd when he ordered two additional shortrange kn09 missiles fired chinas foreign ministry spokesman hong lei dismissed that notion saying i dont see any basis for this link however north korea did call china its sworn enemy and according to an unnamed source that provided the information to koreas chosun ilbo a signboard at a cadets school read china is a betrayer and our enemy the source even added if theyre driven into a corner they wont hesitate to go to war against china since kim carried out north koreas third nuclear test last year china has slowly been distancing itself this weeks meeting with park is expected to cover a wide variety of topics one of which will how to deal with north korea since china has been moving away kim has been looking for other regional partners most notably russia with north korea preparing its fourth nuclear test what park needs to secure from this meeting is a clear idea of how china will respond and thats the question i have for you with north korea vying for attention when it finally does carry out the next

everyone who is thai and is qualified can take part in that election — even the family of thaksin shinawatra we are not hunting thaksin as we did before we would like to see him come back and fight the legal charges against him if he is confident he can win then he will be able to return to politics i dont for one minute believe that will happen since the junta has summoned and detained several red shirt thaksin supporters the ncpo has also set up numerous panels to monitor news organizations and social media each panel will have representatives from the police army navy air force foreign ministry prime ministers office public relations department and other state bodies the creation of these panels constitutes a new stage in the gagging of news and information by the thai military junta said benjamin ismaïl the head of the reporters without borders asiapacific desk that an interim constitution appears to be ready is a good sign things are moving forward especially if he is able to secure the kings endorsement of the new constitution when that occurs countries like the united states that have vocally opposed the coup may find themselves having to backtrack the king has

taiwan affairs office made his first trip to the selfruled island last week to meet with mayor of the proindependence southern port of kaohsiung chen chu protesters met zhang labeling him a communist bandit we know that taiwan people cherish very much the social system and the life style they have chosen we in mainland china respect what taiwanese people have chosen said zhang after the meeting over the past few months taiwan has been riddled with protests which chen explained to zhang were part of their political system chen chu should face the demands of the people and the values of human rights and refrain from the pursuit of economic growth at the expense of taiwans hardearned democratic achievements said chen yinting part of a group of protesters where zhang and chen met the protests in taiwan were tame compared to what occurred in hong kong earlier this week july 1 st is a day of traditional protest in hong kong coinciding with the handover occurred in 1997 and the start of the one country two systems agreement that agreement allows residents civil liberties not seen on the mainland including free speech and the right to protest concerns have been mounting in hong kong that those freedoms are being eroded ever since a white paper was published in june by beijing a 10day unofficial poll providing options for the citys leader was condemned by beijing on monday saying it violated the rule of law and that all candidates must be approved by a nominating committee leading many to fear candidates might be stacked with probeijing nominees chinese universitys hong kong institute of asiapacific studies revealed that nearly 44 of hong kong residents mistrusted the central government at the overnight sitin protest where organizers say up to half a million people attended but the police put the number closer to 100000 500 were arrested for illegal assembly and obstructing police most of those arrested did not struggle but some had to be forcibly removed many of those arrested were released the following day protest groups have threatened to disrupt the financial district if their demands for electoral reforms arent met with increasing dissatisfaction with beijing and calls for more protests what do you think is the future of hong kongs democracy will china respond with force or will they find a way meet in the middle to quell any signs discontent so it doesnt spill over and affect the islands economy before we continue id like to thank quikpod for their support this week if you have a camera and are looking for a monopod head over to quikpodcom ive

voice of america depression in korea a survey released earlier this year showed nearly half of korean teenagers had suicidal thoughts the korean health promotion foundation said one in four survey respondents said they have no one to talk to even more said they turn to friends instead of teachers counselors or parents we have social institutions and counselors at school to help teenagers with stress but what we need is a mindset in which they utilize those resources just like they would go to a pharmacy or hospital when they get cold said mo sanghyun a research fellow at the national youth policy institute in seoul it may be why the number of suicides has risen to 13 in100000 even when other developed nations rates are decreasing generally seeking out psychological treatment in korea is looked negatively upon in the days immediately following the sewol sinking onsite counselors were dispatched but grieving parents opted out of the provided therapy thankfully since the surviving students were moved from the southern tip of korea they have been getting much needed help about 70 secondyear students arrived at danwon high school on june 25th at a press conference held onsite a young male student said we are very tired from the unwanted attention we have been receiving please just treat each of us like any other 18yearold as expected it was an emotionally charged event the student continued we are still suffering at first we couldnt shower we couldnt sleep adults we meet tell us to forget the accident our friends and teachers but we will not forget because its the best we can do the students who had been staying at the ansan small business training institute and undergoing therapy since the sinking were starting classes combining regular curriculum with psychological treatment we consulted with gyeonggi provincial office of education and decided it would be better for the students to return because it would be more difficult for them to adapt to classes again if they kept staying at the training institute explained park seoksun a spokesperson for the parents just over 70 days passed since the sewol sinking when the students returned to school and the semester was just about to finish i question if it was truly the best decision taking students who have endured significant psychological trauma and placing them back into a fish bowl during finals hardly seems the safest approach when even the mere mention of reporter causes some to shake with fear how korea cares for these young men and women will come under great scrutiny since it appears to have failed one conscript on june 20 th sergeant lim of the 22 nd infantry division near goseong killed five of his comrades and then fled what followed was a massive manhunt in which lim was captured only after failing to kill himself immediately following the shooting spree that started everything it was made known that lim was on the list of servicepersons who require special attention as he had difficulties in adapting himself to the military life following lims capture defense minister kim kwanjin apologized saying i sincerely apologize to the people and the bereaved families for such a regretful incident in the eastern frontline general outpost that killed five and wounded seven but how did something like this happen why would the military place an individual under observation in a high stress environment did lim have the requisite skills to effectively cope with the situation and was adequate help available investigators looking into the incident are trying to uncover exactly what caused lim to go on the shooting spree kim minseok ministry spokesperson said lim had expressed regret for his actions and said bullying drove him to despair and that he felt like a squashed insect the statements outraged bereft family members causing them to feel as if their sons were to blame for lims actions i think there was a problem with the way the military looks at each of our children each of them is the one and only for us a bereaved father told media minister kim said what we call bullying is still in existence at the barracks but we are investigating whether it is the only cause of his shooting rampage the military is withholding lims suicide note in its entirety at the request of the victims families some theorize its because its contents may shed light on a military culture of bullying its something the army has been trying to eradicate as the practice has been cited in other suicides and shootings another possible reason to withhold the letter might be to deflect blame from the army while the unit where lim was station had psychological treatments available clearly they were either ineffective or underutilized given lims special status if bullying was the cause of the rampage did the military do enough to end the practice and get lim the help he needed its a question the investigation needs to ask and get a brutally honest answer to if the army truly wishes to end the hazing practice i cant help but wonder what the physiological fitness levels will be of the surviving sewol children when its time for their compulsory service i have often seen children in korea unable to keep their emotions in check when something happens they boil over in anger and lash out sometimes violently could it be that in this testdriven society insufficient time is given for emotional growth that adequate coping mechanisms arent fully developed resulting in suicidal thoughts or fatal acts of violence how do you feel about counseling is it just mumbo jumbo or can it help troubled individuals what do children need to develop strong minds and healthy outlooks on life i hope youll share your thoughts on this important topic sources wall street journal asia now asia news network hankyoreh asia now korea herald channel news asia korea herald peace in mindanao its no secret i love the philippines after all my wifes filipina ive traveled throughout the archipelago and to be sure i have my favorite places while their famous tourism slogan proclaims its more fun in the philippines mindanao has been engaged in armed conflict for five decades resulting in the death of over 120000 philippine president benigno aquino was able to broker a deal with the moro islamic liberation front milf in march of this year and allow for an autonomous government all steps will be done that they can sit already in office by january 2015 he said if all goes to plan it will finally bring much needed stability to the area and more importantly tourists many visiting the philippines stay away from mindanao stagnating the economy of the resource rich region some traveling to the philippines want nontouristy experiences mindanao fits the bill and is beautiful but because of numerous travel advisories warning against going there many opt to visit elsewhere hopefully this peace will last and the region will prosper but that doesnt mean it will happen all at once abu sayyaf heads another muslim group in mindanao one blamed for beheadings bombings and kidnappings the government calls them terrorists and they could still muck things up for a prosperous future sources voice of america reuters remarks those are the stories for this weeks show but lets hear what you had to say about last weeks tyyppis7 writes in response to japans capital punishment laws im no humanitarian but surely a lethal injection would be a better alternative than hanging ghostbusr7 added i dont think japans method of detaining a prisoner on death row is humane and neither is the method of putting the criminal to death august hayek commented on chinese expansion issues the us should recognize the fact the east asian security issues can no longer be dealt with us japan and south korea relationship south korea is going back to where the peninsula always belonged and the china knows this and exploiting the whole situation by far the most divisive comments came from our coverage in the change on japans child pornography law jim mullins from the mullys place podcast echoed many by saying wtf japan when it was made known the country was the last of the oecd and g7 to ban the material with real children but leave manga and animated versions perdomot took up the discussion on the other side of the debate by saying as a manga fan ive been hearing this debate for a long time and my view is that banning any topic in manga is a bad idea it doesnt stop the pedophiles from thinking about such things if you could eliminate it that way wouldnt eliminating gun violence in movies cut down on shootings in real life not waiting for hollywood to do this any time soon underage kids in manga is certainly not the only genre that comes across as negative take guro ntr or straight out rape for example couldnt pay me to look at these genres regardless of how good the art was or how clever the writing but i wouldnt think it a good idea to ban it either since some folks like it bottom line is that people need to be held accountable for their own actions not their thoughts because nobody can control those nobody from our

            "text": "Cardinal Zen has expressed anger at the Beijing-backed church’s decision to consecrate a number of bishops. China’s Catholics are split between those practicing in a state-sanctioned church loyal to the Communist Party, and underground churches that pledge allegiance to the Vatican.\n\nCardinal Zen no longer heads the Diocese of Hong Kong, but as cardinal he remains a prominent Chinese figure in the Vatican hierarchy. His successor, John Tong, has also called for Beijing to stop ordaining bishops not approved by the Vatican.\n\nIn July 2012, Beijing’s patriotic church ordained a bishop despite objections by the Vatican, which excommunicated the man. That same month, Thaddeus Ma, who was ordained by the patriotic church as the auxiliary bishop of Shanghai with the approval of both Beijing and the Vatican, used his ordination ceremony to quit the patriotic church.\n\nBishop Ma was subsequently put under house arrest, where he remains today.\n\nDespite the Vatican’s eagerness to establish ties with Beijing, other significant obstacles remain, including the future role of the mainland’s patriotic church, which would lose power under any detente with the Vatican. The Vatican also maintains diplomatic ties with Taiwan, and Beijing is skittish at the idea of ceding authority to Rome.\n\n“The church is always ready for dialogue — the question is whether the other side is ready for dialogue,” Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said Sunday.\n\nProgress has been made. Beijing granted Pope Francis permission to fly through Chinese airspace en route to Seoul — a courtesy not accorded Pope John Paul II. Pope Francis sent a telegram extending his best wishes to Chinese President Xi Jinping and the Chinese people as he flew overhead.\n\nEdward Ngai contributed to this article.\n\n————————————————————————-\n\nAlso popular on Korea Real Time now:\n\nPop, Punk Stars Spice Up Pope’s Visit\n\nFour Leadership Lessons From the Pope",

What we are waiting for is only the order to be given by the Supreme Command to strike the provocateurs,\" it added.\n\nSouth Korea's Marine Corps carried out a live-fire drill for a second straight day on Thursday near the country's five border islands in the Yellow Sea, including Yeonpyeong and Baengnyeong.\n\n\"The naval drills yesterday and today are regular ones, and we did not fire in a northern direction, but in a southwestern direction. It is absurd to say that the South encroached on North Korean territorial waters,\" a military officer said.\n\nIn May, Pyongyang fired two shells into waters near a South Korean warship on patrol south of the maritime border in the Yellow Sea, prompting the patrol boat to return fire. No casualties or property damage were reported.\n\nHours before issuing the statement Thursday, the North fired three short-range rockets from its east coast. The North's media has not made comment on the firing.\n\ngraceoh@yna.co.kr",
