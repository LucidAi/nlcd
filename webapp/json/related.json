Petroleum coke \u2014 also known as pet coke \u2014 is a black, rock-like substance produced by the petroleum industry and used as a fuel.              Detroit Bulk Storage failed to cart away all the petroleum coke by an Aug. 9 deadline listed last week in an order from Detroit's Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department, Bing's office said Tuesday.              The piles result from Marathon Oil's refining exports from oil sands in Alberta, Canada. Freighters have been taking the piles from the Detroit riverfront to Ohio.

Every day, U.S. oil and gas producers bring to the surface  60 million barrels of waste water, with a salt content up to 20  times higher than sea water and laced with hazardous chemicals.                For the most part, they dispose of it safely, as required by  federal and state laws.                Most of it is re-injected into oil and gas bearing  formations to maintain pressure, or into disposal formations far  below the freshwater aquifers.                Safe disposal of so much hazardous water should put into  perspective some of the recent concerns about water management  raised by opponents of hydraulic fracturing.                                60 MILLION BARRELS                Environmentalists and policymakers have raised concerns  about the massive a", "og:image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/467389/thumbs/s-WASTEWATER-small.jpg", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:site_name": "The Huffington Post", "og:title": "America's Hidden 60 Million Barrel A Day Industry: Dirty Water", "og:type": "article", "og:url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/16/waste-water-barrel_n_1208587.html", "sailthru.date": "Mon, 16 Jan 2012 18:44:00 -0500", "sailthru.expire_date": "Tue, 17 Jan 2012 18:44:00 -0500", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/467389/thumbs/s-WASTEWATER-small.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Green"}]}, "snippet": "Jan 16, 2012 ...
