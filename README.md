========================

This repository contains natural languahe processing library for news detection - `husky`, simple command line pipeline and web application for demostrating final output of the pipeline. This work is prototype, it contains many bug, does not scale and requires special knowlege for using. Our research is in the early stage and we don't provide any useful readme at this point.
