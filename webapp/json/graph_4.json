happening again now you might think so given the talk about a populist revolt on the left but democrats are in fact remarkably united on most issues they agree on everything from increasing the minimum wage to extending unemployment benefits to raising the debt ceiling yes there are divisions emerging over trade and energy but its not anything like the bitter confrontations we used to see among democrats over civil rights and the vietnam war its also not anything like the bitter civil war thats broken out in the republican party no one is threatening to walk out the 1960s was a time of open warfare among democrats the party establishment faced rebellions on two fronts the george wallace voters on the right who objected to the partys embrace of civil rights and antiwar voters on the left who objected to the johnson administrations war in vietnam the wallace voters left the party the antiwar movement left blood on the streets of chicago during the 1968 democratic national convention but it ultimately persuaded the party to its point of view todays democratic party is smaller southern whites are largely gone but far more coherent what was amazing was that democrats held together to pass the new healthcare law without a single republican vote during president barack obamas first two years in office democrats couldnt do that during president bill clintons first two years when they had similar majorities in congress why the sudden surge of democratic party discipline in 2009 and 2010 the answer republicans the tea partys radicalization of the gop ended up splitting republicans and unifying democrats the issues dividing democrats today are over interests rather than values one issue is whether the administration should approve construction of the keystone xl oil pipeline environmental activists are trying to turn the debate into a showdown the president of friends of the earth warned in the washington post that if the president approves this pipeline he reduces what little credibility he has to the rest of the world in showing that the us is going to be a climatechange leader the environmental impact report just released by the state department is far less dire approval or denial of any one crude oil transport project including the pipeline is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the united states an energy consultant told the new york times at the end of the day theres a consensus among most energy experts that the oil will get shipped to market no matter what the obama administration is attempting to reduce this to a debate over interests which approach will risk the least harm to the environment a pew poll taken in september showed nearly two thirds of the public in favor of the pipeline — but democrats were more closely split with 51 percent in favor and 43 percent opposed polling on trade is far more negative obama wants congress to give him fasttrack authority to speed new free trade agreements through the approval process without amendment a poll this month by hart research and chesapeake beach consulting shows the public opposed to fasttrack 62 to 28 percent but guess what democrats are narrowly in favor 52 to 35 percent while republicans — normally strong supporters of free trade — are solidly against 87 to 8 percent a question asking people whether they favor giving the president fasttrack authority elicits views that are more about obama than about trade the debate among democrats over protectionism is not new economists insist that its a debate over economic interests free trade creates jobs in export industries and lowers prices for consumers but at the same time it endangers the jobs of lowwage workers who have to compete with poorly paid foreign workers to most americans however trade is not an economic issue its a moral issue its viewed as wrong for some us workers and consumers to benefit by putting others out of work trade has always divided democrats into probusiness and prolabor factions look at the vote on the north american free trade agreement nafta which president bill clinton submitted to congress in 1993 house democrats voted no on nafta 156 to 102 democratic senators were closely divided — 27 yea and 28 nay clinton got nafta only because of republican support given democrats hostility to free trade and republicans hostility to obama it will be difficult for obama to pull off the same trick fasttrack authority seems to be dead — at least until after the midterm election im against fasttrack senate majority leader harry reid said everyone would be well advised just not to push this right now democrats may be split on energy and trade but there is no indication that liberals will stage a fullscale insurgency like the tea party did theres a reason why liberals are less of a threat to party unity in 2013 according to gallup only 23

conservatives outnumbered republicans 38 to 25 percent last year over the past 20 years conservatives have ranged between 36 and 40 percent of the electorate republicans have ranged between 25 and 34

            "text": "Back in 1901, Finley Peter Dunne’s character Mr. Dooley said, “The Dimmycratic Party ain’t on speakin’ terms with itsilf.” Is that happening again now? You might think so, given the talk about a populist revolt on the left.\n\nBut Democrats are in fact remarkably united on most issues. They agree on everything from increasing the minimum wage, to extending unemployment benefits to raising the debt ceiling.\n\nYes, there are divisions emerging over trade and energy. But it’s not anything like the bitter confrontations we used to see among Democrats over civil rights and the Vietnam War. It’s also not anything like the bitter civil war that’s broken out in the Republican Party. No one is threatening to walk out.\n\nThe 1960s was a time of open warfare among Democrats. The party establishment faced rebellions on two fronts. The George Wallace voters on the right, who objected to the party’s embrace of civil rights; and  antiwar voters on the left, who objected to the Johnson administration’s war in Vietnam. The Wallace voters left the party. The antiwar movement left blood on the streets of Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, but it ultimately persuaded the party to its point of view.\n\nToday’s Democratic Party is smaller (Southern whites are largely gone) but far more coherent.\n\nWhat was amazing was that Democrats held together to pass the new healthcare law without a single Republican vote during President Barack Obama’s first two years in office. Democrats couldn’t do that during President Bill Clinton’s first two years when they had similar majorities in Congress.\n\nWhy the sudden surge of Democratic Party discipline in 2009 and 2010? The answer: Republicans. The Tea Party’s radicalization of the GOP ended up splitting Republicans and unifying Democrats.\n\nThe issues dividing Democrats today are over interests rather than values. One issue is whether the administration should approve construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Environmental activists are trying to turn the debate into a showdown. The president of Friends of the Earth warned in The Washington Post that, “If [the president] approves this pipeline, he reduces what little credibility he has to the rest of the world in showing that the U.S. is going to be a climate-change leader.”\n\nThe environmental impact report just released by the State Department is far less dire: “Approval or denial of any one crude oil transport project, including [the pipeline], is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the United States.”\n\nAn energy consultant told The New York Times, “At the end of the day, there’s a consensus among most energy experts that the oil will get shipped to market no matter what.”\n\nThe Obama administration is attempting to reduce this to a debate over interests: Which approach will risk the least harm to the environment? A Pew poll taken in September showed nearly two thirds of the public in favor of the pipeline — but Democrats were more closely split with 51 percent in favor and 43 percent opposed.\n\nPolling on trade is far more negative. Obama wants Congress to give him “fast-track authority” to speed new free trade agreements through the approval process without amendment. A poll this month by Hart Research and Chesapeake Beach Consulting shows the public opposed to fast-track, 62 to 28 percent. But guess what? Democrats are narrowly in favor (52 to 35 percent), while Republicans — normally strong supporters of free trade — are solidly against (87 to 8 percent). A question asking people whether they favor “giving the president fast-track authority” elicits views that are more about Obama than about trade.\n\nThe debate among Democrats over protectionism is not new. Economists insist that it’s a debate over economic interests: free trade creates jobs in export industries and lowers prices for consumers, but at the same time it endangers the jobs of low-wage workers who have to compete with poorly paid foreign workers.\n\nTo most Americans, however, trade is not an economic issue. It’s a moral issue. It’s viewed as wrong for some U.S. workers and consumers to benefit by putting others out of work.\n\nTrade has always divided Democrats into pro-business and pro-labor factions. Look at the vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which President Bill Clinton submitted to Congress in 1993. House Democrats voted no on NAFTA, 156 to 102. Democratic senators were closely divided — 27 yea and 28 nay. Clinton got NAFTA only because of Republican support.\n\nGiven Democrats’ hostility to free trade and Republicans’ hostility to Obama, it will be difficult for Obama to pull off the same trick. Fast-track authority seems to be dead — at least until after the midterm election.\n\n“I’m against fast-track,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said. “Everyone would be well advised just not to push this right now.”\n\nDemocrats may be split on energy and trade, but there is no indication that liberals will stage a full-scale insurgency like the Tea Party did. There’s a reason why liberals are less of a threat to party unity. In 2013, according to Gallup, only 23 percent of Americans considered themselves liberal. Democrats accounted for 31 percent.\n\nOver the last 20 years, the percentage of Americans identifying as liberal ranged between 16 and 23 percent. Those who identified as Democrat ranged between 31 and 36 percent. The message? Democrats outnumber liberals.  It is to liberals’ advantage to remain loyal to the party.\n\nAt the same time, self-described conservatives outnumbered Republicans 38 to 25 percent last year. Over the past 20 years, conservatives have ranged between 36 and 40 percent of the electorate. Republicans have ranged between 25 and 34 percent. That gives conservatives a strong incentive to go their own way.\n\nAlmost all the Republican candidates lining up to run in 2016 come out of the conservative insurgency. Until recently, the establishment favorite was New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. But Christie is now damaged goods. Establishment Republicans are desperately looking for a new champion to save the party. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker? Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush? Somebody? Anybody?\n\nIf Republicans win control of the Senate this year, the pressure on Hillary Clinton to run will be irresistible. Because if Democrats don’t hold the White House, the legacies of the last two Democratic presidents will be obliterated. And Hillary Clinton was part of both administrations.\n\nPolls of Democrats show Clinton getting nearly unanimous support for the 2016 nomination. Liberal Democrats back her by 74 percent, according to this month’s Washington Post-ABC News poll. Moderate and conservative Democrats are close, with 73 percent for Clinton. College-educated Democrats back her 74 percent and non-college Democrats support her 73 percent.\n\nThat doesn’t sound like a party about to come apart.\n\nThis piece was originally published via Reuters.",

            "text": "Environmentalists have made the Keystone XL Pipeline project a litmus test for President Barack Obama and anyone else with an opinion on climate change.\n\nApprove this dirty project, they argue, and you can't possibly be with us. The Keystone XL is a symbol, they say.\n\nBut here's the thing: Obama has to deal with the world as it is, not the world that he or his supporters in the green movement desire.\n\nThe president should approve the pipeline. Doing so is not inconsistent with his values or his desire to reduce carbon emissions as long as his administration continues to aggressively push for alternative energy.\n\nThe long march toward a decision on the Keystone project took a big step forward last week after a State Department report concluded that the pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution. The rationale: Oil in the Alberta, Canada, tar sands will be extracted whether the pipeline is built or not. It's only a matter of how it is transported. If it is not moved by pipeline, then it will be moved by rail, which may well be more dangerous.\n\nThe United States needs to move deliberately toward alternative sources of energy, and the federal government must take the lead by supporting emerging technologies and providing dollars for research. But the U.S. and the world remain oil dependent. While that must change, such massive shifts in energy mix take time. In the meantime, the world benefits from oil produced by friendly, democratic nations such as Canada, which reduces its dependence on unstable regimes in the Middle East. The pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada to the Gulf Coast.\n\nBecause this is a transnational project, Secretary of State John Kerry is next in line to decide. He will make a recommendation to Obama. But in the end, this is Obama's call.\n\nProvided Obama is convinced that the pipeline can be built and operated safely, there is no reason to say no. And there are reasons to say yes. The pipeline project would strengthen relations with Canada, and it would create nearly 2,000 construction jobs in Kansas, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota. It also creates about 50 full-time jobs in the U.S. once in operation.\n\nThe pipeline has become an important political symbol for opponents, but the State Department report makes clear that its actual impact on the environment is very limited. The report concludes that while the process for extracting the oil from the tar sands produces about 17% more greenhouse gas emissions than traditional oil, that oil will come to market in any case.\n\n\"At the end of the day, there's a consensus among most energy experts that the oil will get shipped to market no matter what,\" Robert McNally, an energy consultant who was a senior energy and economic adviser to President George W. Bush, told The New York Times. \"It's less important than I think it was perceived to be a year ago, both politically and on oil markets.\"\n\nWe agree. Of much greater consequence is another decision on climate change that Obama is expected to make soon. He is moving ahead with a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations that could freeze construction of new coal-fired power plants and close others. While he needs to consider the potential economic impact of such a decision on an industrial state such as Wisconsin, we generally support tougher regulation of the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country.\n\nThe Keystone XL Pipeline may be a powerful symbol for environmentalists, but other decisions likely will have far greater impact. Obama has to deal with reality — and reality in an oil-dependent world says approve the pipeline.",

the state departments environmental review of the keystone xl pipeline is a farce since the beginning of the assessment the oil industry has had a direct pipeline into the agency perhaps most frustrating is the apparent collusion between the state department oil industry and the canadian government in what could be perceived as eagerness to please the oil industry and canadian government

lead to spills or leakage of toxic tar sands crude public citizens texas office director tom smitty smith said the government should investigate and shouldnt let crude flow until that is done given the stakes the potential for a catastrophic spill of hazardous crude along a pipeline that traverses hundreds of streams and rivers and comes within a few miles of some towns and cities it would be irresponsible to allow the pipeline to start operating during construction of keystone i transcanada made 50 special conditions pledges it violated 47 of them in july 2011 its bison natural gas pipeline exploded within six months of startup iroquois pipeline operations is a transcanada subsidiary in the 1990s four senior executives pleaded guilty to knowingly violating environmental and

            "text": "Kerry mocks legitimacy. He represents the worst of America's dark side. He's going all out to be Washington's worst ever Secretary of State.\n\nHe's Obama's war on humanity front man. He blames Syrian President Assad for US-supported death squad crimes. He wants him ousted. He wants Syrian sovereignty destroyed.\n\nHe wants Washington deciding Syria's future. He wants it colonized for profit. He wants Ukraine exploited the same way.\n\nHe supports ultranationalist extremists. He blames Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych for US-supported street thug violence.\n\nHe's Israel's man in Washington. His peace deal is fake. It's entirely one-sided. It demands unconditional Palestinian surrender.\n\nHe's a billionaire. He supports corporate-enriching trade deals. They legitimize selling unsafe foods, medicines and other products.\n\nThey're designed to make him richer. They're at the expense of enormous public harm. They risk ecocide.\n\n1,661-mile Alberta, Canada to Port Arthur, TX pipeline. At issue is transporting toxic tar sands oil from Western Canada to refineries on America's Gulf coast.\n\nDoing so entails passing through environmentally sensitive areas in six states. They include waterways and the Ogallala Aquifer.\n\nIt's one of the world's largest. It supplies about 30% of America's irrigation ground water. It's vital for human consumption.\n\nFriends of the Earth said Keystone XL (KXL) \"will carry one of the world's dirtiest fuels: tar sands oil.\" Its route \"could devastate ecosystems and pollute water sources, and would jeopardize public health.\"\n\nBig Oil wants it. So do Republicans and many Democrats. Expect Obama to rubber-stamp approval.\n\nThe State Department's Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) falsely claimed no risks to health and safety. More on this below.\n\nIt promised its Keystone I pipeline would leak at most once every seven years. In year one, it leaked 12 times. It was once a month on average. It was unprecedented in US pipeline history.\n\nFor many reasons, it states. NASA scientist James Hansen calls it \"a fuse to the largest carbon bomb on the planet.\"\n\nAll pipelines spill. Avoidance is impossible. Large-scale environmental damage is too great a price to pay.\n\nTransCanada said up to 700,000 gallons of tar sands crude could leak without detection. Safeguards are weak and ineffective.\n\nPipeline construction abuses eminent domain. TransCanada \"intimidated landowners\" along planned routes. It did so in previous pipeline construction.\n\nIt contractually forced landowners to accede to its demands. It \"fraudulently steals land from private citizens through eminent domain.\"\n\nWater contamination is certain. The Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer (CWA) is threatened.\n\nRelease of enough tar sands contaminants would make affected water resources unfit for human consumption.\n\nCWA \"is one of the greatest assets of the East-Central region of Texas. It provides water for agriculture, industry, and human consumption and use.\"\n\nIt's far too valuable to contaminate. KXL assures it. Remediation would be hard to impossible to achieve.\n\nAt best up to 4,650 temporary ones will be created. In two years or less they'll be gone. \"KXL will not be a major source of US jobs, nor will it play any substantial role at all in putting Americans back to work.\"\n\nDiverting tar sands oil \"now supplying Midwest refineries, so it can be sold at higher prices to the Gulf Coast and export markets (means) Midwest (consumers) could be paying 10 to 20 cents more per gallon for gasoline and diesel fuel.\"\n\nDoing so will adversely impact other spending and cost jobs. KXL will have \"a chilling effect on green investments and green jobs creation.\"\n\nGreen investments generated \"2.7 million jobs in the US and could generate many more.\"\n\n\"Tar Sands oil and energy independence really do not belong in the same sentence.\"\n\nCornell, the Natural Resources Defense Council and other independent assessments say KXL assures higher gas prices.\n\nExporting tar sands oil won't reduce US dependence on foreign supplies. Prioritizing exports is planned. At issue is selling at the highest possible price.\n\nTransCanada won't disclose an analysis of chemical dilutents used to facilitate transporting tar sands oil through KXL. At issue are human and environmentally destructive substances.\n\nThe Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration told Congress that pipeline regulations weren't crafted with tar sands oil in mind.\n\nThey're woefully inadequate and require strengthening. At a time of business as usual, don't expect it.\n\nResults falsely claimed minimal environmental contamination risk. KXL's southern area \"Gulf Coast Project\" failed to conduct its own environmental assessment.\n\nIssues related to the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer, wild fires, droughts, and others weren't examined.\n\n\"The State Department’s environmental review of the Keystone XL pipeline is a farce. Since the beginning of the assessment, the oil industry has had a direct pipeline into the agency.\"\n\n\"Perhaps most frustrating, is the apparent collusion between the State Department, oil industry and the Canadian government.\"\n\n\"In what could be perceived as eagerness to please the oil industry and Canadian government, the State Department is issuing this report amidst an ongoing investigation into conflicts of interest, and lying, by its contractor.\"\n\n\"It is unacceptable that the oil industry and a foreign government are better informed than the American Congress and its citizenry.\"\n\n\"By letting the oil industry influence this process, Secretary Kerry is undermining his long-established reputation as a leader in the fight against climate change.\"\n\n\"President Obama can end this charade; sufficient scientific data exists to justify denying the Keystone XL pipeline.\"\n\n\"It is a simple matter of having the political will, and courage, to stand up to the oil industry. This decision is a defining moment in his environmental legacy.\"\n\n\"(F)rom day one, the State Department's review of the pipeline (was) polluted by conflicts of interest, insider lobbying and the heavy hand of Big Oil.\"\n\nState Department officials relied on TransCanada-picked contractors for their report. Doing so represents an outrageous conflict of interest.\n\nRelying on Big Oil interests related construction company interests eliminated any chance for responsible analysis.\n\nObama had plenty of evidence without EIS to reject KXL. \"The bottom line,\" said FOE, \"it's not in the national interest. (K)ill \"it now.\"\n\n\"Thousands of people around the country are taking a stand against the import of dirty tar sands oil - from farmers and ranchers in Nebraska who don't want a tar sands pipeline plowed through their property, to families in Texas concerned about their drinking water, to Americans everywhere who want to move towards a clean energy future.\"\n\nNWF \"is working to stop this dangerous project, and your voice is urgently needed. Take a stand against\" KXL!\n\nThe Sierra Club urged \"no more Big Oil pipeline spills that endanger our water.\"\n\nKXL \"threaten(s) the drinking water of two million Americans.\" TransCanada has a deplorable environmental record.\n\nIn 2011 alone, over a quarter million Americans expressed opposition to KXL. Nebraska rancher Susan Luebbe perhaps spoke for others, saying:\n\n\"How can the State Department even think of approving a new tar sands pipeline when the existing one is springing leaks on average once a month.\"\n\n\"Ranchers, farmers and millions of other Americans depend on clean water from the Ogallala Aquifer, which lies directly under the path of\" KXL.\n\nIt highlighted safety issues. Documented problems include \"excessive bending or sagging, and pealing patches of field coating applied to cover damage on pipe about to be placed into the ground.\"\n\n\"Anomolies\" in pipe \"buried for months include \"dents, sags, and other problems that could lead to spills or leakage of toxic tar sands crude.\"\n\n\"The government should investigate, and shouldn’t let crude flow until that is done.\"\n\n\"Given the stakes - the potential for a catastrophic spill of hazardous crude along a pipeline that traverses hundreds of streams and rivers and comes within a few miles of some towns and cities - it would be irresponsible to allow the pipeline to start operating.\"\n\nDuring construction of Keystone I, TransCanada made 50 special conditions pledges. It violated 47 of them.\n\nIn July 2011, its Bison natural gas pipeline exploded within six months of startup.\n\nIroquois Pipeline Operations is a TransCanada subsidiary. In the 1990s, four senior executives pleaded guilty to knowingly violating environmental and safety pipeline construction permit provisions.\n\nThey promised exceptional safety. They willfully failed to deliver. \"TransCanada's history with pipeline problems speaks for itself,\" said Smith.\n\n\"I fear we could be looking at another pipeline whose integrity may be in question.\"\n\nThe Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) urged \"Stopping the Keystone XL.\" Enormous potential environmental damage is risked, it said.\n\nIt'll transport \"the dirtiest oil on the planet.\" It's \"difficult, costly and energy-intensive to produce.\"\n\nConstructing KXL will \"kill more jobs than it creates.\" Oil transported is intended for export, not domestic use.\n\nKXL \"was never in America's national interest. Clean energy and fuel efficiency is the path forward for economic and energy security.\"\n\nReject \"another tar sands pipeline.\" Expect rubber-stamp Obama approval. He's beholden to Big Oil. He's been this way throughout his political career.\n\nHis US Senate voting record was strongly pro-business. He supported strip-mining on public and private land.\n\nHe backed secretly drafted Bush administration energy policy. Rhetorically he opposed it.\n\nHe supported vastly expanding nuclear power, lax industry regulation, billions of dollars in subsidies, and other benefits demanding rejection.\n\nHe voted for biofuels production and other agribusiness interests. He strongly supports GMO foods and ingredients.\n\nHe's a corporate stooge. There's never \"been a bigger con man in the White House than Barack Obama,\" said Ralph Nader. He says one thing. He does another. His rhetoric belies his policies.\n\nHe's a corporatist \"from A to Z.\" So are Kerry and likeminded administration officials.\n\nOn February, the State Department opened a 30 day comment period. Eight US agencies have 90 days to weigh in. They'll offer feedback.\n\nIt's pro forma mumbo jumbo. What corporate America wants it gets. Obama's fully on board. Expect rubber-stamp KXL approval.\n\nLast June, he signaled it saying he'll back construction if \"it does not significantly exacerbate the climate problem.\"\n\nLast week, TransCanada began shipping oil through its southern Keystone pipeline leg. It runs from Cushing, OK to Port Arthur, TX.\n\nTC awaits approval to begin building its 1,179 mile northern pipeline. It'll transport tar sands oil from Hardisty, Alberta through Montana to Steele City, NB.\n\nEnvironmental contamination will follow. Wealth, power and privilege alone matter.\n\nObama is no man of the people. He's a corporatist writ large. Change to believe in works one way.

inflatable replica of a pipeline formed a human chain around the white house yesterday try to convince barack obama to block the controversial keystone xl pipeline project the proposed pipeline by transcanada would transport a very dirty form of crude oil from the alberta tar sands across the american heartland to texas tar sands oil emits three times as much greenhouse gases as a regular

from canadas tar sands field to gulf coast refineries now in new york city to support the occupy wall street protest klein is interviewed by democracy now to discuss the connections between the two struggles and the cozy relationship between the white house the us state department that is considering the proposed pipeline and keystone xl lobbyists naomi klein says i think whats driving people to the streets in new york and around the country now in the occupy together movement and moment is the realization that change is not going to come through the ballot box because the political process has been bought and paid for one thing that i find so inspiring about this moment and i say this of both the keystone xl protests and the occupy wall street protest is that my biggest fear about the obama presidency was that it was going to lead this generation of young people into political cynicism and political apathy because you saw such tremendous hopes raised in 2008 and so many young people really drove that campaign knocking on doors and sleeping on floors for obama many of us saw the betrayals coming and they have come in climate more than any other area but also just in the failure to provide hope for this generation and they could be retreating into cynicism and apathy but instead of retreating into cynicism and apathy they are going to where the power is theyre realizing that the change is not coming in washington because politicians are so controlled by corporate interests and that is the fundamental crisis in this country and thats whats so profound about this so you have paul elliott who was deputy campaign director for hillary clintons campaign gets hired by transcanada which is the company that is building — wants to build this pipeline from the alberta tar sands to texas to carry a very dirty form of oil tar sands oil emits three times as much greenhouse gases as a regular barrel of canadian crude because of course it is in solid form so you have to use all of this energy to get it out and liquefy it and then to put it into that pipeline so its very controversial they know its controversial because theres a huge international movement

was a comparatively warm or cool year this analysis concerns only temperature anomalies not absolute temperature temperature anomalies are computed relative to the base period 19511980 the reason to work with anomalies rather than absolute temperature is that absolute temperature varies markedly in short distances while monthly or annual temperature anomalies are representative of a much larger

not all that much emphasizes james hansen the director of nasas goddard institute for space studies giss in new york city in the giss analysis for example 2010 differed from 2005 by less than 001 °c 0018 °f a difference so small that the temperatures of these two years are indistinguishable given the uncertainty of the calculation meanwhile the third warmest year 2009 is so close to 1998 2002 2003 2006 and 2007 with the maximum difference between the years being a mere 003 °c that all six years are virtually tied even for a near recordbreaking year like 2010 the broader context is more important than a single year certainly it is interesting that 2010 was so warm despite the presence of a la niña and a remarkably inactive sun two factors that have a cooling influence on the planet

            "text": "Those who follow the debate about the Keystone XL Pipeline have very likely formed their own opinion about the project’s merits, or dangers. Further presentations may not change any minds.\n\nThe controversial project is still awaiting approval or rejection by President Obama. Late last month the U.S. State Department issued its final environmental impact statement. As summarized by this Jan 31st article in the New York Times:\n\n\n\nThe State Department released a report on Friday concluding that the Keystone XL pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution, leaving an opening for President Obama to approve the politically divisive project. The department’s long-awaited environmental impact statement appears to indicate that the project could pass the criteria Mr. Obama set forth in a speech last summer when he said he would approve the 1,700-mile pipeline if it would not “significantly exacerbate” the problem of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nPolitical pressure surrounding Keystone is intense and could be especially problematic for this president, as conveyed by the Washington Post:\n\nThe decision remains politically fraught for Democrats. Environmental activists fiercely oppose it, arguing that the pipeline could leak, would accelerate development of the greenhouse gas-intensive oil sands in Alberta and would increase the nation’s dependence on fossil fuels. Wendy Abrams, founder of the Chicago-based nonprofit group Cool Globes and a major Democratic campaign contributor, said she felt a “gut-wrenching pain for my kids” when she read the report. She said it made her question her past support of Obama and Kerry. “If they can’t get it done, what am I hoping for?”\n\nThe New York Times recently gave the topic “Room for Debate” treatment, asking: Is Keystone worth the Fight?\n\nThe yes column was represented by: Bill McKibben, environmentalist; J. David Huges, geoscientist; Jane Kleep from Bold Nebraska and Erich Pica with Friends of the Earth U.S.\n\nMcKibben framed it this way:\n\nAs it turns out, Keystone XL is the issue that has brought more activists into the street than any environmental question in a generation. That’s because they understand that if we’re ever going to tackle global warming we actually have to leave some carbon in the ground. And they understood that this was one place where President Obama, acting by himself, could make an enormous difference. Should he do the right thing, it would be the first time a world leader has said: Here’s a project we won’t build because of its effect on the climate.\n\nThe no column included: Tony Horwitz, author, “Boom”; Burton Richter, physicist; Cindy Schild, American Petroleum Institute and Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger with the Breakthrough Institute. Those arguments range from Keystone XL being a good/necessary project or that its dangers have been overstated in a way that misdirect attention from more important efforts.\n\nHere’s how Burton Richter, author of “Beyond Smoke and Mirrors: Climate Change and Energy in the 21st Century” put it:\n\nThose opposed to Keystone are trying to mobilize support for a cause: combating climate change. I do support that cause, but will not waste time or effort on things that do no real good. Now if the Keystone opponents wanted to mobilize to push through a carbon tax, I would be with them, but that is much harder. The anti-Keystone movement is fundamentally about politics and building support for the “anti-something” organizations.\n\nThis is where a post would normally close with some sage observation. But I can only state the obvious: Canadians and Americans remain divided on the pros and cons of this project. And reasoned arguments seem unable to bridge that fundamental divide.",

has marched up the east coast to terrorize the morning commute thursday more than 150 million people remain under a winter storm warning or advisory as snow falls in some northeast cities at a rate of 12 inches per hour the rate of snowfall will be hard to deal with said kevin roth a forecaster with the the weather channel it will be a very rough commute the may have enough plows to deal with normal storms but with two inches an hour the they drive by and the snow just builds back up this will affect any roadways or airport runways in the region it could be a very long weekend for many parents since monday is a holiday schools may just decide to close tomorrow as well as closing or letting out early today down in new orleans it was a bad day for former mayor ray nagin and former sttammany coroner peter galvin but a good day for a city that has endured more than its share of political corruption from nolacoms james varney ray nagin convicted peter galvan sentenced – a good day for louisiana wednesday was a very good day at us district court in new orleans for those who favor good government in louisiana or maybe simply for justice either way when a former mayor of new orleans gets convicted on 20 of 21 corruption counts in one federal courtroom and a crooked coroner is sentenced to two years in another it at least means the bad guys dont always get away with it who knows what ray nagin new orleans mayor during its darkest hour of katrina will be sentenced to he faces up to 20 years in prison and im hard pressed to come up with many reasons he should get much less meanwhile disgraced former st tammany coroner peter galvan who managed to make himself the highest paid official in the state and sweeten his pension pot while also raking in undeserved sick pay and other goodies got off with a 2year sentence when he could have gotten five from the christian science monitor summarizes the evidence against nagin the case against the former mayor was towering in the nineday trial prosecutors summoned many coconspirators to the stand who testified to the paytoplay schemes nagin orchestrated plus the bribes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that he sought and then redirected to stone age a granite countertop business operated by his sons who were not charged in addition to the witnesses prosecutors presented jurors with a mountain of evidence – email correspondence business contracts credit card and bank statements and more – that they said proved the mayor was a willing participant in wielding power for personal profit nagin was convicted on five counts of bribery nine counts of wire fraud one count of money laundering conspiracy four counts of filing false tax returns and one overarching count of conspiracy jurors acquitted nagin of a single charge of bribery related to a 10000 bribe that prosecutors said he accepted through the family business the physical evidence was so overwhelming that for ray nagin to have successfully defended this case he would have had in some way to refute these documents and use his credibility says michael sherman a political scientist at tulane university in new orleans and a former legal adviser to current mayor mitch landrieu now if we could just get the federal government to stop letting corporations to get away with murder my jaw dropped when i saw this headline at reuters comcast to buy time warner cable for 452 billion comcast corp said on thursday it would buy time warner cable inc for 452 billion in an allstock deal that combines the two largest us cable operators the friendly takeover comes as a surprise after months of public pursuit of time warner cable by smaller rival charter communications inc and immediately raised questions as to whether it would pass regulatory scrutiny comcast will pay 15882 per share which is roughly what time warner cable demanded from charter the combined company would divest 3 million subscribers about a quarter of time warners 12 million customers together with comcasts 22 million video subscribers the roughly 30 million total would represent just under 30 percent of the us pay television video market the new cable giant would tower over its closest video competitor directv which has about 20 million video customers wtf comcast already owns broadcast giant nbc and now they will essential control the distribution of tv and internet cable if the feds let this go through it will be another huge step backward to the robber baron days whatever happened to the sherman antitrust act anyway this news out of kentucky is just unbelievable sinkhole erupts inside national corvette museum from the autoblog a 40foot sinkhole see photo at left developed inside the national corvette museum overnight in bowling green ky swallowing up eight vehicles including two corvette models on loan from general motors no one was in the museum at the time of the incident which happened early this morning according to the ncm motion sensors were set off at 544 am leading museum authorities to discover a 25 to 30foot deep chasm that executive director wendell strode called pretty significant the sinkhole developed in the museums skydome although it cant be seen on any of the museums webcams the enthusiast cam is the closest look we can get to whats going on the louisville courierjournal reports emergency personnel remain on the scene and have only allowed museum employees to remove a single vehicle – the only remaining 1983 corvette which was part of a mere 44vehicle run the two cars on loan from gm were a 1993 zr1 spyder and a 2009 zr1 blue devil while the damanged museumowned cars included a 1962 corvette the millionth vette ever built a 1992 a 2001 mallett hammer z06 and the 15 millionth car produced none of the damaged vehicles were on loan from private individuals the extent of the damage to these vehicles remains unclear at this time finally some science news scientists at lawrence livermore national laboratory claim to have achieved nuclear fusion from the la times nuclear fusion reactions mark a milestone it took 192 lasers and a building big enough to contain three football fields but physicists have finally produced a pair of nuclear fusion reactions that created more energy than was in the fuel to start with the reactions lasted less than a billionth of a second and they released only a few thousand joules — enough to power a 100watt light bulb for less than three minutes but it marks the first time scientists have been able to harness the power of stars here on earth this is really an important milestone said warren mori a plasma physicist at ucla who was not involved in the effort the experiment conducted at lawrence livermore national laboratory in the bay area is still a very long way from ignition the point at which the reaction generates more energy than was required to kick it off with lasers scientists agree that significant hurdles remain before that goal can be reached but the tests described wednesday in the journal nature give researchers a promising sign that theyre finally on the right path to reaching this goal — one that could ultimately lead to cleaner nuclear energy safer weapons arsenals and a more profound understanding of astrophysics so what stories are you following today as always please post your recommended links in the comment

the time it is finally over monday this storm will have multiple waves of snow sleet and freezing rain sweeping west to east across the country first snow will taper off over parts of the southern and central rockies a few additional inches of snow are expected over the mountains of colorado and northern new mexico this storm will drop snow in the west parts of the south and midwest and then move into upstate new york and northern new england its not yet clear what well be getting in the northeast but right now we are expecting a warm weekend and the storm shouldnt interfere with the super

virgina and virginia with several inches of accumulation possible parts of northwest texas and southern oklahoma near the red river could measure up to around six inches of snow maximus will be closely followed by winter storm nika which will bring widespread snow and ice to the plains the great lakes and the northeast tomorrow is ground hog day but whether or not the sleepy rodent sees his

conason provides an example of how government has worked well in two bloodred states universal prek ask republicans in georgia and oklahoma — and then ask grover norquist among the biggest policy mistakes of the past 50 years is our continuing failure to provide quality early childhood education to all of americas kids for children families and society as a whole the benefits of universal prek are not only significant and well documented but offset the financial cost many times over although weve been aware of these basic facts since the early sixties most politicians have preferred to squander billions of dollars on malfunctioning weaponry catastrophic wars and petroleum subsidies even if there were no economic upside to starting the education of every child at three or four years of age the obvious social benefits would vital for any country that aspires to cultivating a vibrant democratic republic citizens who can read and do math and perhaps take an interest in science are more likely to succeed at selfgovernment they are also far more likely to succeed in life enhancing personal opportunity is how universal preschool generates universal public savings — estimated by a large cohort of studies to lie somewhere between 7 and 17 dollars for every single dollar spent human brains mostly develop well before age five so children who attend quality preschool enter kindergarten with social skills confidence and knowledge that boosts achievement for many years so what happened in georgia and oklahoma in oklahoma where every child has been entitled to free

kids to dcs free public preschool program despise his avowed opposition to taxes of any kind maybe some of those right wing congresspeople should have a talk with him about early childhood education its looking more and more like the keystone xl pipeline will be approved according to the nyt the state department released a report on friday concluding that the keystone xl pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution leaving an opening for president obama to approve the politically divisive project the departments longawaited environmental impact statement appears to indicate that the project could pass the criteria mr obama set forth in a speech last summer when he said he would approve the 1700mile pipeline if it would not significantly exacerbate the problem of greenhouse gas emissions although the pipeline would carry 830000 barrels of oil a day from canada to the gulf coast the report appears to indicate that if it were not built carbonheavy oil would still be extracted at the same rate from pristine alberta forest and transported to refineries by rail instead the report sets up a difficult decision for secretary of state john kerry who now must make a recommendation on the international project to mr obama mr kerry who hopes to make action on climate change a key part of his legacy has never publicly offered his personal views on the pipeline aides said mr kerry was preparing to dive into the 11volume report and would give high priority to the issue of global warming in making the decision his aides offered no timetable if so there will be pushback from indigenous americans keystone xl black snake pipeline to face epic opposition from native american alliance a native american alliance is forming to block construction of

article about the winter olympic games and vladimir putins russia sochi or bust the conspicuous dazzle of the games masks a country and a president in deepening trouble february 7th sees the opening of the winter olympics in sochi on the black sea the message of the games is simple russia is back sochi was planned as a celebration of russias resurgence a symbol of international recognition and a crowning moment for vladimir putin its president who for the present seems to have seen off all his challengers appropriately the opening ceremony will include the image of the russian troikabird from nikolai gogols dead souls rus wrote gogol arent you soaring like a spry troika that cant be overtaken the road is smoking under you the bridges thunder everything steps aside and is left behindis this lightning thrown down from heaven other nations and states gaze askance step off the road and give you right of way the quote has long been used to justify russian exceptionalism and moral superiority gogol describes russia as a deeply flawed and corrupt country but it is precisely its misery and sinfulness that entitles it to mystical regeneration his troika carries a swindler chichikov and his drunken coachman but it is transformed into the symbol of a godinspired country that gloriously surpasses all others so too with the sochi olympics this grand enterprise the largest construction project in russias postsoviet history is also a microcosm of russian corruption inefficiencies excesses of wealth and disregard for ordinary citizens the olympics are widely seen as an extravagant caprice of russias rulers especially its flamboyantly macho president rather than a common national effort the cost of the games has more than quadrupled since 2007 making them at 50 billion the most expensive in history one member of the international olympic committee thinks about a third of that money has been stolen russias opposition leaders say the figure is much higher check it out its a long read but worthwhile imo theres some good news out of new york city now that neofacist mayor mike bloomberg is gone it looks like the stop and frisk policy will end soon mayor says new york city will settle suits on stopandfrisk tactics new york city will settle its longrunning legal battle over the police departments practice of stopping questioning and often frisking people on the street — a divisive issue at the heart of the mayoral race last year — by agreeing to reforms that a judge ordered in august mayor bill de blasio announced on thursday in making the announcement which he said he hoped would end a turbulent chapter in the citys racial history mr de blasio offered a sweeping repudiation of the aggressive policing practices that had been a hallmark of his predecessor michael r bloomberg but that had stoked anger and resentment in many black and latino neighborhoods he essentially reversed the course set by mr bloomberg whose administration had appealed the judges ruling were here today to turn the page on one of the most divisive problems in our city mr de blasio said at a news conference we believe in ending the overuse of stopandfrisk that has unfairly targeted young africanamerican and latino men thats great news but i wish he had noted that women have also been targeted often in sexually abusive ways ill wrap this up and put my remaining links in the

yikes what the heck does that mean the story doesnt explain but meteorologists are begging us not to call it a polar vortex temperatures are set to drop again in the midwest and northeast starting sunday a forecast that already is prompting the return of the phrase polar vortex — widely used to describe the blast of cold air that chilled the us earlier this month but while the upper midwest great lakes and the interior northeast will experience belowaverage temperatures in the coming week dont call it a polar vortex meteorologists say the polar vortex is a real weather phenomenon just not one that actually visits the united states they say its actually a circular weather pattern that has always been stationed above the arctic explains weathercom according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the swirling highaltitude system never moves into the us though parts of it can break off and push cold air south the cold experienced in early january was actually a result of the polar vortex weakening becoming warmer and therefore releasing its powerful chill beyond its normal reach through the northern climes noaa says weather experts at noaa said the intense cold air the us has experienced is in fact a result of a warming world and increasing climate variability while researchers can not yet determine whether the fluctuations are a result of natural patterns or environmental effects meteorologists can predict that parts of the us will see freezing weather again in the coming days as a result of a polar vortex breakdown anyway im going to have to

explicit and violent language here are the first few paragraphs i was 12 hours into a summer vacation in palm springs when my phone hummed to life buzzing twice next to me in the dark of my hotel room i squinted at the screen it was 530 am and a friend was texting me from the opposite coast amanda this twitter account freaking out over here she wrote there is a twitter account that seems to have been set up for the purpose of making death threats to you i dragged myself out of bed and opened my laptop a few hours earlier someone going by the username headlessfemalepig had sent me seven tweets i see you are physically not very attractive figured the first said then you suck a lot of drunk and drug fucked guys cocks as a female journalist who writes about sex among other things none of this feedback was particularly out of the ordinary but this guy took it to another level i am 36 years old i did 12 years for manslaughter i killed a woman like you who decided to make fun of guys cocks and then happy to say we live in the same state im looking you up and when i find you im going to rape you and remove your head there was more but the final tweet summed it up you are going to die and i am the one who is going to kill you i promise you this my fingers paused over the keyboard i felt disoriented and terrified then embarrassed for being scared and finally pissed on the one hand it seemed unlikely that id soon be defiled and decapitated at the hands of a serial rapistmurderer on the other hand headlessfemalepig was clearly a deranged individual with a bizarre fixation on me i picked up my phone and dialed 911 read the rest at the link a number of women have written about this issue and particularly about the lack of protection for women who are harassed online from law enforcement–even though the threats sometimes lead to reallife actions a couple more recent examples skepchick wrote in october about being harassed for her participation in the online atheist community why i dont just go to the cops amy wallace wrote about her experiences in a nyt oped over the weekend life as a female journalist hot or not along similar lines i came across this 2010 article in the boston globe that provides some insight into why some people spend so much time and energy writing angry comments on line inside the mind of the anonymous online poster the author got an interview with a frequent commenter to the boston globe website he also discusses the problems newspapers face in dealing with angry and trolling comments from anonymous people heres an excerpt on monday may 17 at 2 pm a breaking news article headlined obamas aunt given ok to stay in united states hits the home page of bostoncom in a matter of seconds the first anonymous online comment appears a reader with the handle of peregrinite writes of course she can can someone appeal certain topics never fail to generate a flood of impassioned reactions online immigration president obama federal

all five of those contentious subjects in the next few minutes several equally innocuous posts follow including a rare comment in favor of the judges decision then the namecalling begins at 203 pm a commenter with the pseudonym of craptulous calls the aunt zeituni onyango a foreign freeloader seconds later comes the lament from redzone 300 just another reason to hate are sic corrupt government news websites from across the country struggle to maintain civility in their online comments forums but given their anonymous nature and anythinggoes ethos these forums can sometimes feel as ungovernable as the tribal lands of pakistan read much more at the link yesterday i also happened upon a fascinating article by national security and tech journalist dan verton in the piece verton tries to come up with a psychological profile of nsa leaker edward snowden what does the history of insider espionage say about edward snowden he wasnt the first and will certainly not be the last member of the us intelligence community to betray the trust of his nation but what do we really know about edward snowden the former national security agency contractor who leaked thousands of documents detailing nsas domestic and global eavesdropping programs the truth is we know very little about snowden beyond what the media outlets that have a vested interest in protecting him choose to report but when viewed through the prism of the last 25 years of insider espionage the edward snowden we do know seems to fit the typical profile of the trusted insider struggling to overcome personal and professional shortcomings and suffering from a warped sense of moral superiority more than a decade worth of studies into the psychological profiles of malicious insiders have revealed several common characteristics that make information technology professionals — particularly system administrators like edward snowden — an at risk population for malicious insider activity verton discusses snowdens history in the light of a study of it administrators who eventually sabotaged their employers in some way inside the mind of the insider by eric d shaw jerrold m post and keven g ruby these are both fairly long pieces but if you have any interest in the ongoing snowden saga they are must reads a bit more from verton born in 1983 snowden grew up in north carolina and maryland his father was a coast guard officer and his mother worked as a court administrator they divorced in 2001 and snowden went to live with his mother his parents claim snowden was ill as a teenager and failed to graduate high school he eventually studied at a local community college to obtain a ged snowden was 17 when alqaida launched its attacks against the united states on sept 11 2001 at that time he adopted an online persona he called the one true hooha at the website ars technica where he participated in chat forums for gamers and hackers his studies at a local community college would once again fall short of a degree in 2003 snowden decided to join the army reserve and requested a chance to undergo evaluation training for special forces to in his words fight to help free people from oppression yet again the young snowden would fall short he was dropped from the program and discharged from the army four months later snowden claims to have broken both of his legs during training but to date has provided no evidence the army has confirmed his service but would not release his service record summary known as a dd214 he comes from a family that has a high need for achievement but his experience is one disaster after another stock said lots more educated speculation on snowdens motives at the link in other news heres a spy story i hadnt heard about in the mainstream media report israel passes us military technology to china secret us missile and electrooptics technology was transferred to china recently by israel prompting anger from the us and causing a senior israeli defense official to resign the head of defense exports for the israeli defense ministry resigned after a us investigation concluded that technology including a miniature refrigeration system manufactured by ricor and used for missiles and in electrooptic equipment was sent to china according to the israeli newspaper maariv another israeli news site aretz sheva reports the us is concerned the technology could ultimately find its way to iran which last year sought to buy military equipment from china for its nuclear program that sounds scarier than the stuff glenn greenwald has been

it is not sitting right on the pole as it usually does laden writes we are not seeing an expansion of cold an ice age or an antiglobal warming phenomenon we are seeing the usual cold polar air taking

magic spell that caused a teacher to become sick lawyers for the student said on friday the american civil liberties union said it had filed a lawsuit in the us district court in tulsa oklahoma on behalf of student brandi blackbear charging that the assistant principal of union intermediate high school in broken arrow oklahoma suspended her for 15 days last december for supposedly casting a spell the suit also charged the tulsaarea union public schools with repeatedly violating blackbears civil rights by seizing notebooks she used to write horror stories and barring her from drawing or wearing signs of the pagan religion wicca its hard for me to believe that in the year 2000 i am walking into court to defend my daughter against charges of witchcraft brought by her own school said timothy blackbear brandis father wtf so what were learning is that at least a teacher and presumably members of the administration of a school in oklahoma believes it is possible to cast magic spells

by the hardware store to get ice melt crystals and then headed to the grocery store to drop off a prescription and a few things ill need in case i cant get my car out of the driveway for a couple of days i had an appointment in the afternoon and then i made a fruitless attempt to find a parking space in the giant whole foods parking lot in cambridge then back to my regular grocery store to pick up my prescription and a few refrigerated items the store was even more packed this time so i was glad i had stopped earlier finally i went home to stash my purchases and scatter ice melt on the all the icy surfaces left over from winter storm dion so now im in hibernation mode until monday i just hope i can handle the shoveling myself the weather folks are predicting anything from 5 to 12 inches of snow for my area it was 11 degrees here when i woke up and its only 12 degrees right now its hard to believe it can even snow when its so cold but the weather people say its going to snow if it starts this afternoon i plan to shovel before it gets dark–then there wont be so much to do tomorrow its way too early for this it wont even be officially winter until next week those of you in the midwest are probably already getting the storm–how is it going there is it still cold down south we can commiserate in the comments now to the news its hard to believe its been a year since newtown but today is the anniversary of that awful day it still breaks my heart when i think about it i cant even begin to imagine the pain of the families who lost children from cnn horror struck newtown connecticut in such a disturbing way that the nation still struggles with its impact a year later the legacy of the seconddeadliest mass shooting in us history is so profound that it can not hold just

after the morning bell and kills six adult women 12 girls and eight boys in 11 minutes the children were 6 or 7 years old the heavily armed adam lanza who first killed his mother before taking her car to the school also killed himself in a classroom on the anniversary of the december 14 slaughter — under the shadow of another school shooting this time at arapahoe high school in centennial colorado — country and community alike pause and reflect on an event known simply as newtown or sandy hook and what it says about america on the matters of guns mental health healing and the human spirit a whole year after the slaughter of 20 firstgraders and 6 adults and our donothing congress has done exactly nothing to control the purchase of weapons of war for everyday use cbs news reports not a single federal law curbing gun violence has passed in the year since a young man from newtown conn whod long exhibited signs of mental instability got a hold of his mothers ar15style bushmaster rifle and two of her handguns and gunned down 20 firstgraders and six of their educators at sandy hook elementary school before taking his own life capping a year that saw the most mass shootings in us history newtown seemed to mark a turning point in national conversation about gun control within a month of the shooting president obama promising to make the issue a hallmark of his secondterm agenda had signed several executive orders to make schools safer and gun purchases more transparent but real reform he said would require bipartisan backing from lawmakers on capitol hill six months after the dec 14 2012 tragedy sen joe manchin dwva insisted the push for tougher gun laws and bolstered support for mental health in america was still on the front burner but foundation for that statement was flimsy manchins own amendment to strengthen background checks for gun purchases – cosponsored by sen pat toomey rpa and seen by many in congress to be the most realistic hope for immediate reform to gun laws – had collapsed in the senate two months earlier senate majority leader harry reid dnev had hit pause on debate over firearms altogether pulling the legislation from the floor indefinitely the emotions surrounding newtown it seemed were no longer driving the conversation about gun control is anyone really surprised that something a huge majority of americans support can not get through congress of course not we cant even get them to stop hurting the economy with their obsessive and idiotic push for unnecessary austerity we should turn every one of them out of office–democrats and republicans and start from scratch and is anyone shocked that there was another school shooting the day before this horrible anniversary why should we be our socalled leaders dont seem to care how

            "text": "Snow began falling here before 7AM, and there is already a coating over everything. Of course we already had a around a foot of the stuff on the ground, so whatever we get will pile on top of that. Depending on where the rain/snow line falls, everything may be coated with ice by tonight.\n\nOnce again the South has been hit hard with winter weather. The Washington Post reports: Winter storm headed toward D.C. knocks out power across the Southeast U.S.\n\nA powerful winter storm dropped a coat of snow and freezing rain across the Southeast on Wednesday, leaving almost 300,000 customers without power, forcing the cancellation ofmore than 3,600 flights, and creating gridlock on roadways in North Carolina. In Atlanta, where another recent snowstorm had caused massive traffic jams, people seemed to have learned their lesson. Schools were closed. Workers stayed home. The city turned into a kind of wintry ghost town. But in North Carolina, drivers didn’t seem to have learned the lesson at all. In both Charlotte and Raleigh, news outlets reported that people headed out onto ice-covered roads in mid-afternoon. The result was the same it had been in Atlanta two weeks ago: creeping traffic, abandoned cars and folks offering stranded motorists a place to stay the night…. As Wednesday went on, the storm swept from Alabama, across Georgia and up into the Carolinas on its way toward Virginia and the Washington area.\n\nCBS Atlanta warned Georgians to stay off the roads today if possible.\n\nGeorgia Department of Transportation officials said they are expecting road conditions to remain treacherous into Thursday morning as sleet and freezing rain is expected to continue. GDOT is urging the public to avoid all but emergency travel until at least mid-day Thursday Forecasters at the National Weather Service said they are expecting falling pieces of melting ice to pose threats to drivers and pedestrians near overpasses and tall structures on Thursday. Forecasters are also anticipating wet roads to refreeze Thursday night, which could lead to patches of black ice. Several inches of snow could accumulate in North Georgia while the area across the state between a line just north of Columbus, Macon, Warner Robins and Statesboro and extending northward to above Interstate Highway 20 are experiencing icing roadways, power lines and trees. Moreover, winds gusting to as much as 30 m.p.h. could cause limbs and trees to fall on power lines and roads. A State of Emergency remains in effect for 91 counties in this region.\n\nThey knew it was coming. But drivers in North Carolina still fell prey to the winter storm that the National Weather Service predicted would be “potentially crippling” to the area. Even those who left just after noon have been trapped by the heavy snow that arrived today. “Snow arrives in the Triangle as expected but causes gridlock anyway,” reads the headline in the Raleigh News Observer, referring to the Research Triangle of the cities Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill. The intense traffic came one day after Gov. Pat McCrory declared a state of emergency ahead of the winter storm. From what we’re seeing, people are blaming the problem on two factors: The snow came on fast and immediately stuck to roads; and most commuters who worked Wednesday tried to leave at the same time, adding to the gridlock. The worst of the conditions may be yet to come, as officials expect freezing rain and sleet to hit the area as the storm moves out.\n\nFrom NBC News: ‘Very Rough Commute’ Looms as Snow Blankets Much of Northeast.\n\nThe winter storm that tore through the American South, knocking out power to a half-million people, has marched up the East Coast to terrorize the morning commute Thursday. More than 150 million people remain under a winter storm warning or advisory as snow falls in some Northeast cities at a rate of 1-2 inches per hour. “The rate of snowfall will be hard to deal with,” said Kevin Roth, a forecaster with the The Weather Channel. “It will be a very rough commute. The may have enough plows to deal with normal storms but with two inches an hour the they drive by and the snow just builds back up. This will affect any roadways or airport runways in the region.”\n\nIt could be a very long weekend for many parents. Since Monday is a holiday, schools may just decide to close tomorrow as well as closing or letting out early today.\n\nDown in New Orleans, it was a bad day for former Mayor Ray Nagin and former St.Tammany coroner Peter Galvin, but a good day for a city that has endured more than it’s share of political corruption. From Nola.com’s James Varney: Ray Nagin convicted, Peter Galvan sentenced – a good day for Louisiana.\n\nWednesday was a very good day at U.S. District Court in New Orleans for those who favor good government in Louisiana. Or maybe simply for justice. Either way, when a former mayor of New Orleans gets convicted on 20 of 21 corruption counts in one federal courtroom, and a crooked coroner is sentenced to two years in another, it at least means the bad guys don’t always get away with it. Who knows what Ray Nagin, New Orleans’ mayor during its darkest hour of Katrina, will be sentenced to? He faces up to 20 years in prison, and I’m hard pressed to come up with many reasons he should get much less…. Meanwhile, disgraced former St. Tammany coroner Peter Galvan, who managed to make himself the highest paid official in the state and sweeten his pension pot while also raking in undeserved sick pay and other goodies, got off with a 2-year sentence when he could have gotten five.\n\nFrom the Christian Science Monitor summarizes the evidence against Nagin:\n\nThe case against the former mayor was towering. In the nine-day trial, prosecutors summoned many co-conspirators to the stand who testified to the pay-to-play schemes Nagin orchestrated, plus the bribes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that he sought and then redirected to Stone Age, a granite countertop business operated by his sons, who were not charged. In addition to the witnesses, prosecutors presented jurors with a mountain of evidence – e-mail correspondence, business contracts, credit card and bank statements, and more – that they said proved the mayor was a willing participant in wielding power for personal profit. Nagin was convicted on five counts of bribery, nine counts of wire fraud, one count of money laundering conspiracy, four counts of filing false tax returns, and one overarching count of conspiracy. Jurors acquitted Nagin of a single charge of bribery related to a $10,000 bribe that prosecutors said he accepted through the family business. “The physical evidence was so overwhelming that for Ray Nagin to have successfully defended this case, he would have had, in some way, to refute these documents and use his credibility,” says Michael Sherman, a political scientist at Tulane University in New Orleans and a former legal adviser to current mayor Mitch Landrieu.\n\nNow if we could just get the Federal government to stop letting corporations to get away with murder. My jaw dropped when I saw this headline at Reuters: Comcast to buy Time Warner Cable for $45.2 billion.\n\nComcast Corp said on Thursday it would buy Time Warner Cable Inc for $45.2 billion in an all-stock deal that combines the two largest U.S. cable operators. The friendly takeover comes as a surprise after months of public pursuit of Time Warner Cable by smaller rival Charter Communications Inc, and immediately raised questions as to whether it would pass regulatory scrutiny. Comcast will pay $158.82 per share, which is roughly what Time Warner Cable demanded from Charter. The combined company would divest 3 million subscribers, about a quarter of Time Warner’s 12 million customers. Together with Comcast’s 22 million video subscribers, the roughly 30 million total would represent just under 30 percent of the U.S. pay television video market. The new cable giant would tower over its closest video competitor, DirecTV, which has about 20 million video customers.\n\nWTF?! Comcast already owns broadcast giant NBC, and now they will essential control the distribution of TV and internet cable? If the feds let this go through, it will be another huge step backward to the Robber Baron days. Whatever happened to the Sherman AntiTrust Act, anyway?\n\nThis news out of Kentucky is just unbelievable: Sinkhole ‘erupts’ inside National Corvette Museum. From the Autoblog:\n\nA 40-foot sinkhole (see photo at left)  developed inside the National Corvette Museum overnight in Bowling Green, KY, swallowing up eight vehicles, including two Corvette models on loan from General Motors. No one was in the museum at the time of the incident, which happened early this morning. According to the NCM, motion sensors were set off at 5:44 AM, leading museum authorities to discover a 25 to 30-foot deep chasm, that Executive Director Wendell Strode called “pretty significant.” The sinkhole developed in the museum’s Skydome, although it can’t be seen on any of the museum’s webcams (the Enthusiast cam is the closest look we can get to what’s going on). The Louisville Courier-Journal reports emergency personnel remain on the scene, and have only allowed museum employees to remove a single vehicle – the only remaining 1983 Corvette, which was part of a mere 44-vehicle run. The two cars on loan from GM were a 1993 ZR-1 Spyder and a 2009 ZR1 “Blue Devil,” while the damanged museum-owned cars included a 1962 Corvette, the millionth Vette ever built (a 1992), a 2001 Mallett Hammer Z06 and the 1.5 millionth car produced. None of the damaged vehicles were on loan from private individuals. The extent of the damage to these vehicles remains unclear at this time.\n\nFinally, some science news: Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory claim to have achieved nuclear fusion. From the LA Times: Nuclear fusion reactions mark a ‘milestone’\n\nIt took 192 lasers and a building big enough to contain three football fields, but physicists have finally produced a pair of nuclear fusion reactions that created more energy than was in the fuel to start with. The reactions lasted less than a billionth of a second, and they released only a few thousand joules — enough to power a 100-watt light bulb for less than three minutes. But it marks the first time scientists have been able to harness the power of stars here on Earth. “This is really an important milestone,” said Warren Mori, a plasma physicist at UCLA who was not involved in the effort. The experiment, conducted at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the Bay Area, is still a very long way from “ignition,” the point at which the reaction generates more energy than was required to kick it off with lasers. Scientists agree that significant hurdles remain before that goal can be reached. But the tests, described Wednesday in the journal Nature, give researchers a promising sign that they’re finally on the right path to reaching this goal — one that could ultimately lead to cleaner nuclear energy, safer weapons arsenals and a more profound understanding of astrophysics.\n\nSo . . . what stories are you following today?

            "text": "A colleague notes that we frequently stumble with the phrase “as such.”\n\nHere’s what The Times’s stylebook says:\n\nWhen “as such” is used correctly, with a clear antecedent, you should be able to substitute that antecedent for “such” and have the sentence make sense. So, in the stylebook example, you could say, “She is an editor; as an editor, she assigns reporters.” In the second example, there is no clear antecedent.\n\nBut we frequently misuse “as such” in a much looser way to connect two thoughts. Often the intended sense is more like “therefore,” “thus” or “and so.” If there’s no clear noun antecedent for “such,” think again and rephrase.\n\nHere are several recent missteps, including two in one day:\n\nMr. Buchanan’s one-year ban did not apply to the committee at large because his government paycheck had come from the House Republican Conference, a leadership arm of the party that Mr. Hensarling led in 2011 and 2012. As such, Mr. Buchanan was restricted from lobbying only Mr. Hensarling and a few other committee members who also belonged to leadership.\n\nThere’s no noun in the preceding sentence that could substitute for “such” — that is, no clear antecedent. Recast with a different connecting expression: “for that reason,” “therefore,” “so” or something else.\n\n“The Bone Season” is a bit hard to summarize in a paragraph or two: It involves clairvoyants, alternate dimensions and a penal colony for those with supernatural powers. As such, it drew comparisons with “Harry Potter” rather than with “The Hunger Games.”\n\nAgain, there’s no antecedent. One solution is to recast the previous sentence to supply one. For example: “It is a story of clairvoyants, etc.” Then “as such” works: “As such [that is, as a story of clairvoyants, etc.], it drew comparisons with ‘Harry Potter.’”\n\nThe settlement terms call for the attorney general to use most of the proceeds to help hard-pressed homeowners and communities fight foreclosures and to bolster efforts to fight financial fraud. As such, the terms were similar to those of a settlement in 2012 with several big banks, in which Mr. Schneiderman garnered $136 million to use for foreclosure relief.\n\nSame problem. A simple solution would be to start the second sentence with “those terms” or “such terms.”\n\nDespite the logistical challenges, Fratello said, he had fond memories. The Hawks developed relationships with several Soviet players who eventually played in the N.B.A. It was global outreach on a small scale.\n\nAs such, Fratello said he admired what Rodman was doing in North Korea.\n\nHere, the simplest fix might be “So Fratello said he admired …”\n\nThis week’s grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.\n\nAhead of making his decision, Mr. Kerry will take counsel from the leaders of eight other government agencies: the Departments of Defense, Justice, Interior, Commerce, Transportation, Energy and Homeland Security and the E.P.A.\n\nMany readers object to the increasing popularity of “ahead of,” saying that it is merely a faddish substitute for “before.” In fact, it does add an additional nuance in some contexts, conveying the sense of “in preparation for” or “in anticipation of.” But here, the straightforward “before” would work perfectly, so let’s use it.\n\nBut Dr. Joffe agreed with the report that the wider use of contraceptives — IUD’s that can prevent pregnancy for up to 10 years and injectable hormonal drugs that do so for months — appears to be an important factor in the reported recent decline.\n\nNo apostrophe necessary for the plural of this abbreviation. Note that our latest stylebook revision also eliminated the apostrophe in plurals of abbreviations with periods: C.E.O.s and M.D.s, not C.E.O.’s and M.D.’s. The only surviving use, for clarity, is in plurals of single letters: He received A’s and B’s on his report card. Mind your p’s and q’s.\n\nAlthough there is debate over who he will face, Mr. Patrick has emerged as a strong contender.\n\nWhom, not who; it’s the direct object of “will face.”\n\nThrongs of police officers blocked streets with buses in a bid to prevent bloody clashes as hundreds of antifascist youths — many concealing their faces with black masks — gathered a quarter of a mile away in Syntagma Square wielding batons and rocks, and spoiling for a fight.\n\nThis story is obviously of interest to many international readers, so we should be alert to small things that might puzzle or annoy them. No, we don’t want to convert “a quarter of a mile” to “0.4 kilometers.” But since the measurement is approximate anyway, we could have considered something universally recognizable like “a few minutes’ walk” or “a few blocks” or some such.\n\nInvestigators also planned to test the substances inside to determine if they had been tainted in anyway, though there was no initial indication that they had been.\n\nIndianapolis was the host for the Super Bowl in 2011, when the Giants, one of the teams that plays its home games at MetLife Stadium in Mr. Cassella’s town, defeated the New England Patriots, 21-17.\n\nThe point is that there are two such teams, of which the Giants are one. The antecedent of “that” is the plural “teams.” Make it, “teams that play their home games.”\n\nAnthony Scott managed to survive in the nooks and crannies of Manhattan for two winters, burrowing under piles of blankets and cardboard on West 31st Street if he could not find a spot at Pennsylvania Station, the Port Authority Bus Terminal or on the E train.\n\nIf the same preposition works for all three elements, you can use it just once, at the beginning of the series. But if you need to use a different preposition for the third element — in this case, switching to “on” — then you need a preposition with each of the three elements. Make it “at Pennsylvania Station, at the Port Authority Bus Terminal or on the E train.”\n\nThe Taliban’s involvement, and their brutal efficiency, was an embarrassment for the government.\n\nDespite the commas, treat this as a plural, compound subject, and make the verb “were.” (If we want to convey that the second element is parenthetical or secondary, we could say something like “along with their brutal efficiency.” In that case, the subject and verb are singular.)\n\nThe square itself was bustling and noisy, and much of the racket was contributed by about 14 cigarette sellers, most of whom were orphaned boys and girls hiding their Jewish identities and sleeping either on the streets, in cemeteries or with nervously accommodating Polish families.\n\nGenerally delete “either” when more than two possibilities follow.\n\nBut the justices split, 6 to 3, over whether the gaps between what the airline had told the authorities and what was strictly true was broad enough to allow the suit.\n\nMake it “whether the gaps … were broad enough.”\n\nFor two weeks, Mr. Paul stood by him amid news media attention, but finally let him go.\n\nThe phrase “For two weeks” is meant to apply only to the “stood by him,” so the second verb needs its own subject to make it a separate clause. A simple fix: “but the senator finally let him go.”\n\nHis choice may now be between an inevitably bloody suppression of antigovernment protesters or a surrender of authority that could leave him as president but empower his opponents to chart a pro-European course.\n\nThe choice is between A and B, not between A or B.\n\n“In the ‘50s and early ‘40s, there wasn’t no garbage trucks, especially out in the country,” he said.\n\nThis may have been a formatting glitch, but these apostrophes were backward (that is, they were single-quotes rather than apostrophes).\n\nThe media blogger Jim Romenesko provided a link to what is purported to be an audio copy of a conference call Patch’s chief operating officer, Leigh Zarelli Lewis, had with selected employees at 10 a.m.\n\nThe stylebook says this:\n\nThe hootenanny movement spurred people to play music instead of passively consume it, and the noncommercial, do-it-yourself spirit — though not the sound of banjos and acoustic guitars — would resound in punk-rock, which had its own kind of protest songs.\n\n“Instead of” functions as a preposition, so we need a gerund (that is, a verbal noun), not a verb: “to play music instead of passively consuming it.”\n\nThe ascendance of mobile, both in use of the site and advertising, was apparent in Facebook’s strong fourth-quarter financial results, which the company reported on Wednesday.\n\nWhat comes after “and” should be parallel to what comes after “both.”\n\nBut the dispute over SodaStream has taken the boycott debate way beyond its usual, relatively limited audiences, and it is likely to simmer on.\n\nThis use of “way” as an adverb meaning “far” is colloquial.\n\nWASHINGTON — The White House said Thursday that it is “deeply concerned” with China’s treatment of foreign journalists and expressed disappointment that Austin Ramzy, a New York Times reporter, had been forced to leave the country.\n\nSequence of tenses.

2 per day would need to spend as much as 50 percent of their monthly income to buy just one vial of insulin additional materials such as syringes needles and glucose monitoring tests push costs even higher there is much to be done to prepare for this global epidemic the sheer size of it means that strategies focused solely on treatment will be far too costly if nothing changes in the next two decades india will need to provide chronic care for more than 100 million people with diabetes — close to the entire adult population of russia the solution in india and other developing countries has to include prevention which means promoting healthy eating and physical activity its not easy we have by no means succeeded in the united states in india it will require better policies that favor fruits and vegetables over refinedfood products one opportunity involves indias mid day meal scheme a program that provides lunches to 120 million children the program has been tainted by corruption and deadly contamination problems but as the indian government addresses these issues it also has a chance to reshape the dietary habits of many young people exercise is the other crucial element taking a jog or even walking to work in indian cities often means choking on exhaust fumes and dodging speeding cars creating more sidewalks and bike paths could go a long way the second step is providing diabetes patients with medicines that are effective safe and affordable on the bright side for at least a decade india has manufactured affordable generic insulin but in recent years pharmaceutical companies sensing the potential for profits have begun to market their products aggressively in one major government hospital i saw lines of pharmaceutical representatives with glossy pamphlets and drug samples waiting to speak with clinicians some classes of drugs theyre pushing such as incretin mimetics — which are injected to lower blood sugars — are very costly and though they are approved for use in both the united states and india we dont know enough about their safety in the long run they dont appear to lower blood sugar levels any better than cheaper alternatives like metformin which comes as a pill and is considered the best first choice for many people with diabetes in america expenditures on diabetes medications have soared as newer drugs have been rapidly adopted india desperately needs to create evidencebased guidelines that take into account costeffectiveness so that marketing doesnt drive treatment but even the best medicines will not work without a wellfunctioning health care system diabetes care is not a quick fix you cant take a pill for 10 days and be cured it means working with a clinical team to control the disease month after month year after year this requires a system that is geared toward chronic care which in many countries simply doesnt exist in india there is now a call for universal health care this is encouraging but is a long way from being realized in the meantime india could leverage the lessons learned from many successful hiv programs throughout the developing world that have empowered communities to deliver complex clinical services to millions of people at low cost in order for policy makers and health officials to bring about these changes we must change how we think about the disease most of us in the west assume we know what the risks and burdens of diabetes are and if were talking about a patient in kansas city or tokyo were probably right but when it comes to diabetes location is everything and much of the world is now vulnerable to the most devastating consequences of this disease if were going to be any help at all we need to make a conceptual shift we think we know diabetes — and thats

            "text": "Twelve years ago, my husband and I packed up all of our belongings and moved to Trivandrum — a steamy, tropical town at the southern tip of India in Kerala. At the time, I was a medical student interested in studying stroke. For the next six months I dressed in a sari and walked to work on jungle roads. At the hospital, I immediately began seeing a steady stream of young patients affected by strokes, many of whom were so severely disabled that they were unable to work. I initially suspected the cause was tuberculosis or dengue fever — after all, this was the developing world, where infections have long been primary culprits for disease. But I soon learned that my hunch was wrong.\n\nOne of my first patients was a woman in her mid-30s who came in with a headache, vomiting and an unsteady gait. Her scan showed a brainstem stroke. Her blood sugars were very high. The underlying cause of her stroke was most likely untreated Type 2 diabetes. Here I was, halfway around the globe, in a vastly foreign culture, but I was looking at a disease — and the lifestyle that fostered it — that was startlingly familiar.\n\nToday, I am an endocrinologist, and diabetes has become a full-blown epidemic in India, China, and throughout many emerging economies.\n\nIn the United States, diabetes tends to be a disease that, while certainly not benign, is eminently manageable. Just this month, federal researchers reported that health risks for the approximately 25 million Americans with diabetes had fallen sharply over the last two decades. Elsewhere on the globe, however, diabetes plays out in a dramatically different fashion. Patients often lack access to care and can’t get insulin, blood pressure pills and other medicines that diminish the risk of complications. As more and more people develop the disease, hospitals may soon be overrun with patients experiencing all of its worst outcomes: blindness, limb amputation, kidney failure (necessitating dialysis), coma and death.\n\nWithin the last few decades, South Asia has experienced a rapid economic transition paralleled by an epidemiological shift in disease patterns. Recently, when I returned to India for a yearlong fellowship, I saw this for myself. Indians are now living more sedentary lives, working in banks, labs and call centers; all the while, their diet is changing, as they eat out more and consume foods higher in calories and saturated fats.\n\nWhat’s more, evidence suggests that Indians may be especially predisposed to diabetes, so even those who are slightly overweight are more likely to be at risk. India also has a high malnutrition rate among children, and poor nutrition in early life appears to trigger metabolic changes that lead to diabetes in adulthood. The result is a perfect storm of commerce, lifestyle and genetics.\n\nAccording to the International Diabetes Federation, there are now an estimated 65 million adults with diabetes in India. That number is projected to increase to 109 million by 2035. China also has a diabetes epidemic — with an estimated 98 million people affected. Indonesia has nearly 9 million, and Pakistan nearly 7 million. All told, 382 million people worldwide are living with diabetes, a vast majority in low- and middle-income countries — places where many cases go undiagnosed and untreated.\n\nThe costs associated with diabetes are enormous; they include expenses related to acute and chronic complications, the costs of therapies to prevent them, and the fact that those affected may be unable to work and support their families. Many patients are pushed into bankruptcy. In India, only 10 percent of people have medical insurance, and patients cover most expenses out of pocket. In some low- and middle-income countries, diabetes patients living on $1 or $2 per day would need to spend as much as 50 percent of their monthly income to buy just one vial of insulin. Additional materials such as syringes, needles and glucose monitoring tests push costs even higher.\n\nThere is much to be done to prepare for this global epidemic. The sheer size of it means that strategies focused solely on treatment will be far too costly. If nothing changes in the next two decades, India will need to provide chronic care for more than 100 million people with diabetes — close to the entire adult population of Russia.\n\nThe solution in India and other developing countries has to include prevention, which means promoting healthy eating and physical activity. It’s not easy: We have by no means succeeded in the United States. In India, it will require better policies that favor fruits and vegetables over refined-food products. One opportunity involves India’s Mid Day Meal Scheme, a program that provides lunches to 120 million children. The program has been tainted by corruption and deadly contamination problems, but as the Indian government addresses these issues, it also has a chance to reshape the dietary habits of many young people. Exercise is the other crucial element. Taking a jog or even walking to work in Indian cities often means choking on exhaust fumes and dodging speeding cars. Creating more sidewalks and bike paths could go a long way.\n\nThe second step is providing diabetes patients with medicines that are effective, safe and affordable. On the bright side, for at least a decade, India has manufactured affordable generic insulin. But in recent years, pharmaceutical companies, sensing the potential for profits, have begun to market their products aggressively.\n\nIn one major government hospital, I saw lines of pharmaceutical representatives with glossy pamphlets and drug samples waiting to speak with clinicians. Some classes of drugs they’re pushing, such as incretin mimetics — which are injected to lower blood sugars — are very costly, and though they are approved for use in both the United States and India, we don’t know enough about their safety in the long run. They don’t appear to lower blood sugar levels any better than cheaper alternatives like metformin, which comes as a pill and is considered the best first choice for many people with diabetes. In America, expenditures on diabetes medications have soared as newer drugs have been rapidly adopted. India desperately needs to create evidence-based guidelines that take into account cost-effectiveness so that marketing doesn’t drive treatment.\n\nBut even the best medicines will not work without a well-functioning health care system. Diabetes care is not a quick fix. You can’t take a pill for 10 days and be cured. It means working with a clinical team to control the disease month after month, year after year. This requires a system that is geared toward chronic care, which in many countries simply doesn’t exist. In India, there is now a call for universal health care. This is encouraging but is a long way from being realized. In the meantime, India could leverage the lessons learned from many successful H.I.V. programs throughout the developing world that have empowered communities to deliver complex clinical services to millions of people at low cost.\n\nIn order for policy makers and health officials to bring about these changes, we must change how we think about the disease. Most of us in the West assume we know what the risks and burdens of diabetes are. And if we’re talking about a patient in Kansas City or Tokyo, we’re probably right. But when it comes to diabetes, location is everything, and much of the world is now vulnerable to the most devastating consequences of this disease. If we’re going to be any help at all, we need to make a conceptual shift. We think we know diabetes — and that’s the problem.\n\nKasia Lipska is an endocrinologist at the Yale School of Medicine.",

            "text": "KUNDUZ, Afghanistan — It was bad enough that the alleged rape took place in the sanctity of a mosque, and that the accused man was a mullah who invoked the familiar defense that it had been consensual sex.\n\nBut the victim was only 10 years old. And there was more: The authorities said her family members openly planned to carry out an “honor killing” in the case — against the young girl. The mullah offered to marry his victim instead.\n\nThis past week, the awful matter became even worse. On Tuesday, local policemen removed the girl from the shelter that had given her refuge and returned her to her family, despite complaints from women’s activists that she was likely to be killed.\n\nThe case has broader repercussions. The head of the Women for Afghan Women shelter here where the girl took refuge, Dr. Hassina Sarwari, was at one point driven into hiding by death threats from the girl’s family and other mullahs, who sought to play down the crime by arguing the girl was much older than 10. One militia commander sent Dr. Sarwari threatening texts and an ultimatum to return the girl to her family. The doctor said she now wanted to flee Afghanistan.\n\nThe head of the women’s affairs office in Kunduz, Nederah Geyah, who actively campaigned to have the young girl protected from her family and the mullah prosecuted, resigned on May 21 and moved to another part of the country.\n\nThe case itself would just be an aberrant atrocity, except that the resulting support for the mullah, and for the girl’s family and its honor killing plans, have become emblematic of a broader failure to help Afghan women who have been victims of violence.\n\nThe result challenges hopes that Western aid and encouragement can make lasting headway on behalf of Afghan women, particularly in remote parts of the country where traditional customs are still stronger than modern law. Here, Taliban insurgents and pro-government elements often make common cause in their hatred of progress in women’s rights, most of which has come about with international funding and pressure.\n\nMost of the anger in Kunduz has been focused not on the mullah but on the women’s activists and the shelter, which is one of seven operated across Afghanistan by W omen for Afghan Women, an Afghan-run charity that is heavily dependent on American aid, from both government and private donors.\n\n“People know this office as the Americans’ office,” Dr. Sarwari said. “They all think the shelter is an American shelter. There isn’t a single American here,” she said.\n\n“W.A.W. is not American-run,” said Manizha Naderi, its executive director. “Every single staff member is an Afghan. They are from the communities we work in. Our only concern is to make sure women and girls are protected and that they get justice.”\n\nAs the Western withdrawal from Afghanistan has accelerated, rights advocates are seeing a sharp difference in their funding. “We already see the signs of losing the support of the international community,” said Ms. Geyah, in an interview before she resigned. “No one’s funding new civil society programs anymore. None of the foreigners show up anymore; they’re all in hiding. And I think what gains we have achieved the last 13 years, we’re slowly losing all of them.”\n\nThe accused mullah, Mohammad Amin, was arrested and confessed to having sex with the girl after Quran recitation classes at the mosque on May 1, but claimed that he thought the girl was older and that she responded to his advances.\n\nThe girl’s own testimony, and medical evidence, supported a rape so violent that it caused a fistula, or a break in the wall between the vagina and rectum, according to the police and the official bill of indictment.

One of their claims was that the girl was actually 17, and thus of marriageable age, not 10.\n\nPhotographs of the girl that Dr. Sarwari took in the hospital clearly show a pre-pubescent child, and the doctor said the girl weighed only 40 pounds. Few Afghans have birth records, and many do not know their precise ages. But the girl’s mother said she was 10, and a forensic examination in the hospital agreed, saying she had not yet started menstruating or developing secondary sexual characteristics.\n\nIn the photographs, which Dr. Sarwari displayed on her laptop computer recently, the girl has beautiful alabaster features and inky black hair cut in a pageboy style. She lay in her hospital bed under a quilted blanket with cartoon characters on it.\n\nMs. Geyah said she showed photos of the girl to government officials and prosecutors to prove that she was much too young to have consented. Dr. Sarwari said, “We wanted to give her a face, to make her real to them.”\n\nMs. Geyah said: “I went to the hospital when they brought her there. I was sitting next to her bed when I overheard her mother and aunt saying that her father was under tremendous pressure by the villagers to kill the girl because she had brought shame to them.”\n\nSuch honor killings in rape cases are common in Afghanistan, and are often more important to the victim’s family than vengeance against the attacker. Human rights groups say about 150 honor killings a year come to light, and many more probably go unreported.\n\nWhen Dr. Sarwari, who is a pediatrician, arrived to pick up the girl at the hospital, a crowd of village elders from Alti Gumbad, the girl’s home village on the outskirts of the city of Kunduz, were gathered outside the hospital; the girl’s brothers, father and uncle were among them. Inside, Dr. Sarwari encountered the girl’s aunt, who told her she had been ordered by her husband to sneak the girl out of the hospital and deliver her to the male relatives outside. “She said they wanted to take her and kill her, and dump her in the river,” Dr. Sarwari said.\n\nEfforts to reach the girl’s relatives by telephone were unsuccessful, and insurgent activity around Alti Gumbad made the village too dangerous for journalists to visit. “The girl’s family gave us a guarantee that they would not harm her,” said Sayed Sarwar Hussaini, head of the Kunduz police criminal investigation division. “We would not hand her back unless we were sure.”\n\nIn the hospital room, the doctor found the girl’s mother holding her child’s hand, and both were weeping. “My daughter, may dust and soil protect you now,” Dr. Sarwari quoted the mother as saying. “We will make you a bed of dust and soil. We will send you to the cemetery where you will be safe.”\n\nEven mothers here often believe that there is no choice but to kill rape victims, who are seen as unmarriageable and therefore a lifelong burden to their families, as well as a constant reminder of dishonor. “Their men feel they have to wash their shame with blood,” Dr. Sarwari said.\n\nThe doctor took the girl away to the shelter. Afterward, Dr. Sarwari and several women’s affairs officials were threatened by the girl’s family, and by other mullahs. “They call me and curse me, and threaten to kill me and my family, and say they know where I live,” Dr. Sarwari said. “They say, once your American husbands leave Afghanistan, we will do what we want to you.” (Her husband is an Afghan doctor and war veteran.)\n\nDr. Sarwari has accused prosecutors and religious officials of siding with the accused rapist and ignoring the child’s plight.\n\n“There are a lot of powerful people behind the mullah,” Dr. Sarwari said. The girl’s family knows they cannot do anything to Mr. Amin, she said, but “the girl is easy. They can get to her; she’s their daughter.” She said she feared the girl would either be killed, or forced to recant her accusations against the mullah.\n\nWomen for Afghan Women arranged for the girl to get medical treatment, and after she healed, she was returned to the shelter in Kunduz, about two weeks ago, until the police returned her to her family last Tuesday. Those caring for the girl said she had been terribly homesick and wanted to return to her family, but no one had the heart to tell her they had been conspiring to kill her.",

            "text": "As the Keystone XL pipeline clears a hurdle, we await word from the Obama administration. A New York Times article sums up the plan well:\n\nEnvironmentalists said they were dismayed at some of the report’s conclusions and disputed its objectivity, but they also said it offered Mr. Obama reasons to reject the pipeline. They said they planned to intensify efforts to try to influence Mr. Kerry’s decision. For more than two years, environmentalists have protested the project and been arrested in demonstrations against it around the country. But many Republicans and oil industry executives, who support the pipeline because they say it creates jobs and increases supplies from a friendly source of oil, embraced the findings.\n\nHere at GWP, we are involved on a local level with 350-Vermont. A review of our new book, So Little Time, was published on the 350-Vermont website:\n\nSo Little Time: Words and Images for a World in Climate Crisis is a new book from an emerging Vermont publishing company, Green Writers Press. The book is a compilation of poetry and images from many authors and photographers, including the editor himself, Greg Delanty. After about ten minutes of reading ,it was clear that it is more than just a “read”; this book is an experience. It affected me, filling me up with deeper awareness and beauty.\n\nThis book is, quite literally, close to home. Greg Delantey, as editor, collected poetry from a wide range of authors and photographers from across the world. John Elder penned the forward of the book, and Dede Cummings founded Green Writers Press and published the compilation. These participants are all local Vermonters, and they are all actively involved in what we do here at 350 Vermont.\n\nBill McKibben, an “envoy” for the book, stated: “Environmentalists long ago won the scientific battle, but we need to reach people’s hearts as well. This superb volume will do exactly that.” His words ring true. The poems and images reach deep to pull our souls and minds into new dimensions, and they have a personal, healing value for me as I follow the activist path and put in daily efforts for 350 Vermont.\n\nRegardless of the $30 price tag, I strongly suggest you buy it. The proceeds go to 350.org (international), and to 350 Vermont! Think of it as a donation! However, if you can’t afford it, I suggest spending time with the book at a friend’s house, the book store, the library (soon!), or even the 350 Vermont office here in Burlington!\n\n —Joan & Bethany\n\n~~~\n\n We have been invited to do a presentation and workshop on green publishing with the Green Writers Press model at The Bread Loaf Orion Environmental Writers’ Conference this summer!\n\nThe new conference is to be an annual, week-long writers’ conference, based on the Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference model, that’s designed to hone the skills of people interested in producing literary writing about the environment and the natural world. The conference is co-sponsored by the Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference, Orion magazine, and Middlebury College’s Environmental Studies Program.\n\n Conference Dates\n\n Monday, June 9 – Sunday, June 15, 2014. The conference will take place at the Bread Loaf Campus of Middlebury College in Ripton, Vermont\n\nDede is scheduled with GWP editor, Robin MacArthur, June 11-12th. We are psyched about this! Here is the website for more information, and to apply! http://www.middlebury.edu/blwc/BLOrion\n\nWe are creating a new events page, one for each book, as we are growing quickly and people want to keep track…\n\n Thanks for liking us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/GreenWritersPress\n\n & following us on Twitter https://twitter.com/GreenWritersPub\n\n & mostly….\n\n helping us spread the word!",

get over on messing with indian treaties parks and the epa httpkeystonexlcomhomekeystonexlkxloilpipelinemaps the baker montana gas storage west of the bakken oil wells could also get oil from bakken to texas refineries a pipeline directly east parallel to route 94 avoiding indian reservations could join with the existing oil pipeline to the south refineries the point is that the xl oil pipeline doesnt have to threaten clean water the gas line that the xl oil line wants to parallel doesnt pose a threat june 29 2014 mcstites yep obama has managed to thwart the will of the us population again june 30 2014 livelonger yeah at least a few hundred oil barons june 30 2014 mcstites nope just looking at the polls all i have seen support building the pipeline in general i would say they should not worry about the polls however in this case not building the pipeline will not reduce pollution and would increases the risk and cost of shipping the oil the state department report said environmental groups have lobbied the white house to kill the proposed pipeline—which would carry oil from canadian tar sands to us gulf coast refineries—arguing that it would contribute to climate change and warning of the risk of spills but the state department assessment said the tar sands oil would be extracted regardless of the pipelines approval and found it to be a safer and more environmentally friendly way to transport the crude oil compared to rail or tanker transport find a route and get on with it june 30 2014 livelonger i agree with that run the pipeline away from the aquafers and reservations and get the oil down to the gulf for sale then see how many people it employs and how much less oil will cost to us citizens june 30 2014 mcstites they could spend the next twenty years messing around looking for the ideal route in the meantime there will be a bigger danger of a spill from a train or truck and it will cause more pollution and cost more all increased risk with no gain june 30 2014 livelonger yeah i know the koch brothers are in their seventies and might not live to see the epa destroyed and the pipeline completed in time to make a few more billion they dont need june 30 2014 mcstites whether the koch brothers have anything to do with it or not the delay will increase risk pollution and cost with no gain in anything but of course you would rather have that than any possibility that the koch brothers might gain from it june 30 2014 mrmacq you dont bother looking into anything others post do you mc syphilis just got ta blame the black dude june 30 2014

educate people on this subject unless they seek it out which is why i prefer to listen to scientists and not some nitwit poster on a forum june 30 2014 mcstites not just the polls the state department said there was no reason not to build the pipeline not building will result in more pollution and a higher risk of a spill it makes no sense not to build the pipeline june 30 2014 mcstites

httpss3amazonawscoms3350orgimageskxlseissummaryv5pdf june 30 2014 mcstites let me see first you said i lied now you say the report is flawed your rebuttal is from an organization that very anti fossil fuel the state department report was prepared by the administrations own state department the logic is simple the oil will be shipped and used the alternative methods of shipping are less environmentally friendly it will consume more fossil fuels to move it and there is more risk to the environment by these other methods june 30 2014 carladanger i didnt say you lied although you are spreading lies i said that is a lie the investigation was ordered after an environmental group obtained documents indicating that some consultants for the firm that wrote the draft report had previously done work for transcanada the company seeking to build the pipeline if investigators determine a conflict of interest in the preparation of that draft the state department may have to conduct a new environmental review hello anybody home june 30 2014 mcstites i repeat the logic is simple the oil will be shipped and used the alternative methods of shipping are less environmentally friendly it will consume more fossil fuels to move it and there is more risk to the environment by these other methods where is that logic flawed june 30 2014 carladanger no youre using simple minded logic canada has tripled the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the past decade and its all due to tar sands and how much landscape do they tear up for one barrel of oil this is not going to be good for our economy and its definitely not good for the environment june 30 2014 mcstites the fact remains that oil will be shipped and it will be burned the only issue at question is how that oil will be shipped and the most environmentally damaging method is being used june 30 2014 gbakere the main point to the entire argument is whether or not the oil should be used as fuel at all global warming is a fact the poles are melting and the oceans are rising to say nothing about the added toxins in our atmosphere that are causing more and more cancer and a plethora of other diseases vast shoreline damage radical changes in weather flooding etc are all attributable to climate change – change caused by byrning fossil fuels if the oil leaks into the aquifer the cost would be astronomical to the breadbasket of america its a mess that would be impossible to clean up it would not only negatively impact farmers but would drive up the price of grain – grain used to manufacture 13 of the food we eat talk about costwow stites you talk about environmental damage caused by shipping oil that pales in comparison to the environmental damage caused by drilling shipping and burning oil june

with his charm june 30 2014 carladanger this disease is contagious the affliction is called ods obama derangement syndrome june 30 2014 carladanger james hansen if released all at once the known tar sands resource is equivalent to 150 parts per million as is the case with other fossil fuel sources the amount in the air declines to about 20 percent after 1000 years of course only a small fraction of the resource is economically recoverable at the moment but if you decide you are going to continue your addiction and build a big pipeline to texas the economically extractable oil will steadily grow over time moreover the known resources would grow because there is plenty more to be discovered every seller will tell you his pile of pollution is small compared to the total pile on earth and that is correct what makes tar sands particularly odious is that the energy you get out in the end per unit carbon dioxide is poor its equivalent to burning coal in your automobile we simply can not be that stupid if we want to preserve a planet for our children and grandchildren june 30 2014 brn2bfree ms danger i bet you got all excited and wet yourself when you heard about the xl pipeline permit expiring maybe those indians are more concerned about the word redskins oil will provide jobs for them june 30 2014 livelonger shoveling dead bodies into ovens will also create jobs for wingnuts june 30 2014 carladanger how about the washington teabaggers that sounds like a nice name i bet the tea party wouldnt mind a bit you want to provide jobs for the indians boy that is rich lol june 30 2014 brn2bfree i thought you hated the rich speaking of indians getting rich dont they have casinos up there more jobs means more people means more gamblers no june 30 2014 carladanger here burnout this is from mcstites link supporters of the pipeline say it will create jobs though the number may be limited a study by the cornell global labor institute concluded that the pipeline would create about 3900 construction jobs over two years thats very few jobs considering the impact on our climate june 30 2014 gbakere and only 30 to 50 permanent jobs june 30 2014 mcstites again you are ignoring the primary reason for building the pipeline the oil will be shipped the oil will be consumed stopping the pipeline will not stop that not building the pipeline will result in more pollution by the trucks and trains delivering the oil in addition those methods pose a higher risk of a spill not building the pipeline has negative results all for the benefit of environmental groups who would rather make a point than improve the environment june 30 2014 brn2bfree wtf are you talking about did you have a shit day jobs are good jobs are needed you dont even have a clue on the impact it will have on our environment its something you heard somewhere stupid ass brainwashed liberal talking point its safer via pipeline vs ships or tankers its a plus think about it less ships spilling in the oceansless tankers crashing and killing people and spilling into creeks btw your farting is hurting the environment i demand that you stop farting see how stupid that sounds you sound like that to me wake up you liberal bleep june 30 2014 carladanger burnout has his panties in a wad what you are experiencing is a brain fart and it seems to have rattled your cage im torn should i listen to real scientists on this subject or should i listen to a nitwit poster on a forum i think ill go with the scientists but thanks for playing july 01 2014 carladanger with one more nail in its coffin is

environmentalists the revisions arent as sweeping as climate advocates had sought several people familiar with the governments review told bloomberg news the report also concludes that the pipeline

Canadian heavy crude reached its strongest level in more than two months on the spot market as a pipeline connection to the U.S. Gulf Coast began filling with crude ahead of its startup next month. Associated Press/Dec. 7\n\nWASHINGTON -- A State Department report has concluded that the Keystone XL pipeline will not significantly worsen climate change, according to congressional aides briefed on the study, in a setback for opponents of the project.\n\nWhile the report deviates from a March draft in some ways to the liking of environmentalists, the revisions aren't as sweeping as climate advocates had sought, several people familiar with the government's review told Bloomberg News.\n\nThe report also concludes that the pipeline won't have a big impact on the pace of oil sands development in Alberta, starting point for the pipeline, according to aides who requested anonymity to discuss the briefing. The report recommends more safety measures, such as sensors to warn of leaks, the people said.\n\nThe much-anticipated findings will influence whether President Barack Obama's approves TransCanada Corp.'s $5.4 billion project, which Republicans are pushing as a way to create thousands of construction jobs and boost North American energy independence. Obama has said he will consider the report's conclusions on climate change in his final decision.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney said release of the report doesn't mean a decision is imminent. He declined to say Friday when Obama will make a final determination, referring to the process for public comment and his speech last June in which he said the pipeline will only serve the national interest if it doesn't \"significantly exacerbate\" carbon emissions.\n\nTransCanada applied more than five years ago for a permit to build the pipeline through the U.S. heartland, connecting the oil sands with refineries along the coast of Texas and Louisiana. The project has spawned a multimillion-dollar lobbying fight and is forcing Obama to choose between angering an ally in Canada or his supporters in the environmental movement.\n\nThe March draft report concluded that the Canada-U.S. oil pipeline would have only a minimal impact on carbon emissions, because the oil sands in Alberta will be developed anyway.\n\nRelease of the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement will kick off a separate review in which Obama must determine whether building the pipeline is in the U.S. national interest.\n\n\"No matter what the SEIS says, it would be premature for either side to tear down the goalposts because there is still a long part of the game left to be played,\" said Daniel J. Weiss, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based research group opposed to the pipeline.\n\nThe updated report is likely to contain some changes, the people said. At the request of the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department asked TransCanada to agree to additional measures to prevent leaks, which it did.\n\nThe agency is updating its analysis of how much greenhouse- gas emissions come from a barrel of tar sands compared to a barrel of heavy crude from Venezuela or Mexico. And analysts are including new information about constraints on railroads to move the same amount of oil if the pipeline weren't built, another person said.\n\nThe State Department is handling the review because the project crosses an international border. Its environmental assessment is important because Obama said in a June speech on climate change that he wouldn't approve Keystone if it would \"significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.\"\n\nThe March draft said the heavy crude from Alberta would be developed and delivered to market by rail or through other pipelines if Obama rejected Keystone, which TransCanada first proposed in 2008 to link Alberta with refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Environmentalists had focused their lobbying push on the capacity of trains to make up for the 830,000-barrel a day capacity of Keystone.\n\n\"We haven't heard anything yet regarding the timing of an announcement, but we are hopeful the report on Keystone XL is released soon,\" Shawn Howard, a TransCanada spokesman, said in an email. \"We don't see how the final report would come to a different conclusion\" than previous drafts.\n\nA State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last night that the environmental review was in its final stages of preparation.\n\nEnvironmental groups, which pushed hard to get the State Department to reverse its conclusion that the pipeline would have a minor climate impact, are now looking to the next step in the process as their chance to defeat Keystone.\n\nEight federal agencies have 90 days to give their views to the State Department as it develops its national interest determination.

The executive order that establishes the process for weighing international pipeline projects doesn't set a deadline for the department to make a final recommendation.\n\nSeparately, the State Department's Inspector General is weighing a complaint from Friends of the Earth that the department's contractor reviewing the project is biased because of its ties to TransCanada and the oil industry. Friends of the Earth, which opposes Keystone, says it hopes that report would undercut any of the State Department's conclusions, and force a re-start of the review process.\n\nDouglas Welty, a spokesman for the inspector general, said no date had been set for the release though it is expected early this year.\n\n\"Since the beginning of the assessment, the oil industry has had a direct pipeline into the agency,\" Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth, said in a statement Friday. \"In what could be perceived as eagerness to please the oil industry and Canadian government, the State Department is issuing this report amidst an ongoing investigation into conflicts of interest, and lying, by its contractor.\"\n\nProduction and refining of Alberta's oil sands release more greenhouse-gas emissions than conventional forms of oil. Canadian supporters have argued that the oil will displace heavy crude from Venezuela and Mexico that has a similar carbon footprint and that the project will create thousands of construction jobs.\n\nA decision by Obama to approve the pipeline would anger the thousands of activists who've held dozens of protests, written hundreds of letters. That won't be the end of the process, though.\n\n\"Let's be honest folks, if State Dep't can't get this right we will sue because ranchers' water is more important then flawed status quo process,\" Jane Kleeb, the head of Bold Nebraska, a local group fighting the pipeline, tweeted.\n\nAnd just Thursday, the Sierra Club and 15 other groups filed a petition to Secretary of State John Kerry asking the Keystone be considered together with a separate pipeline expansion request. That could also provide a reason to sue.\n\nCredo Action, Rainforest Action, and the Other 98 Percent have enlisted about 76,000 volunteers to sign a \"pledge to resistance\" and risk arrest for civil disobedience if the project moves forward.\n\nRejecting Keystone carries its own consequences for Obama.

war on climate change our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner safer planet the president said over the past eight years the united states has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on earth indeed its true that in recent years largely thanks to the dampening effects of the great recession us carbon emissions were in decline though they grew by 2 in 2013 still whatever the president may claim were not heading toward a cleaner safer planet if anything were heading toward a dirtier more dangerous world a series of recent developments highlight the way we are losing ground in the epic struggle to slow global warming this has not been for lack of effort around the world dedicated organizations communities and citizens have been working day by day to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote the use of renewable sources of energy the struggle to prevent construction of the keystone xl tarsands pipeline is a case in point as noted in a recent new york times article the campaign against that pipeline has galvanized the environmental movement around the country and attracted thousands of activists to washington dc for protests and civil disobedience at the white house but efforts like these heroic as they may be are being overtaken by a more powerful force the gravitational pull of cheap accessible carbonbased fuels notably oil coal and natural gas in the past few years the ever more widespread use of new extractive technologies notably hydraulic fracturing to exploit shale deposits and steamassisted gravity drainage for tar sands has led to a significant increase in fossil fuel production especially in north america this has left in the dust the likelihood of an imminent peak in global oil and gas output and introduced an alternative narrative much promoted by the energy industry and its boosters of unlimited energy supplies that will last into the distant future barry smitherman of the texas railroad commission which regulates that states oil industry was typical in hailing a relatively boundless supply of oil and gas worldwide at a recent meeting of the society of exploration geophysicists as oil and gas have proven unexpectedly abundant and affordable major energy consumers are planning to rely on them more and on renewable sources of energy less to meet their future requirements as a result the promises we once heard of a substantial decline in fossil fuel use along with a corresponding boom in renewables are fading according to the most recent projections from the us department of energy global fossil fuel consumption is expected to grow by an astonishing 40 by 2035 jumping from 440 to 615 quadrillion british thermal units while the combined share of total world energy that comes from fossil fuels will decline slightly from 84 to 79 they will still dominate the global energy marketplace for decades to come renewables according to these projections will continue to represent only a small fraction of the total if this proves to be accurate there can be only one plausible outcome vastly increased carbon emissions leading to rising temperatures and the sort of catastrophic climate change scenarios that now seem almost impossible to imagine think of it this way in our world the gravitational pull of carbon exerts itself every minute of every day shaping the energy decisions of individuals companies institutions and governments this pull is leading to defeat in the global struggle to slow the advance of severe climate change and is reflected in three recent developments in the energy news a declaration of surrender by bp a major setback in the european union and a strategic endrun by canadian tar sands companies bp announces the defeat of renewables every year energy giant bp once british petroleum releases its energy outlook for the years ahead an analysis of future trends in global production and consumption the 2014 report extending bps energy forecast to the year 2035 was made public on january 15th typically its release is accompanied by a press conference in which top bp executives offer commentary on the state of world energy usually aimed at the business media this year the companys ceo bob dudley spoke with unbridled optimism about the future market for his companys energy products assuring his audience that the global supply of fossil fuels would remain substantial for years to come dudley took over the helm at bp after his predecessor tony hayward was dumped in the wake of the 2010 deepwater horizon disaster in the gulf of mexico the picture in terms of resources in the ground is a good one he noted its very different to past concerns about supply peaking the theory of peak oil seems to have well peaked this no doubt produced the requisite smiles from dudleys oilfriendly audience then his comments took a darker turn can we satisfy the worlds energy requirements with fuels that are sustainable he asked not at the moment he admitted because of a rising tide of fossil fuel consumption he added carbon emissions are currently projected to rise by 29 by 2035 we estimate in the outlook he acknowledged that whatever good news might be found in that document in this area steps are needed to change the forecast next dudley tried to put a hopeful spin on the longterm climate prospect by replacing coalfired power plants with lesscarbonpolluting natural gas he indicated overall greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced increasing the efficiency of energyconsuming devices he added will also help all of this however adds up to little when it comes to the big picture of carbon emissions in the end he could point to few signs of progress in the struggle to slow the advance of climate change in 2035 we project that gas and coal will account for 54 of global energy demand and oil another 27 while renewables will grow rapidly their share will reach just 7 most of the media coverage of dudleys appearance focused on his expectations of longterm energy abundance not what it would do to us or our planet several commentators were however quick to note how unusual it was for an oil company ceo to address the problem of carbon emissions at all no less express something verging on despair over the prospect of making any progress in curbing them dudley concludes that the world is still a long way from delivering the peak in greenhouse gas emissions many scientists advise has to be achieved within the next decade to minimize the risk of dangerous climate change observed energy analyst james murray at businessgreencom europes retrenchment the member states of the european union eu have long exercised global leadership in the struggle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the pace of climate change under their justly celebrated 202020 plan adopted in december 2008 they are committed to reducing their emissions by 20 over 1990 levels by 2020 increasing their overall energy efficiency by 20 and achieving 20 reliance on renewables in total energy consumption no other region has embraced goals as ambitious as these and none has invested greater resources in their implementation any wavering from this path would signal a significant retrenchment in the global climate struggle it now appears that europe is preparing to rein in the pace of its drive to slow global warming at issue is not the implementation of the 202020 plan which is well on its way to being achieved but on the goals that should follow it climate activists and green energy entrepreneurs have been calling for an even more ambitious set of targets for 2030 and beyond many manufacturers and other major energy consumers have been pushing for a slower pace of change claiming that increased reliance on renewables is driving up energy prices and so diminishing their economic competitiveness already it appears that the industrialists are gaining ground at the expense of climate action at stake is the eus climate blueprint for 2030 the next major threshold in its drive to slow the pace of warming on january 22nd the eus executive arm the european commission ec released its guidelines for the new plan which must still be approved by the eu parliament and its member states while touted by some as a sign of continued european commitment to decisive climate action the ecs plan is viewed as a distinct setback by many environmental leaders at first glance the plan looks promising it calls for a 40 reduction in emissions by 2030 a huge drop from the 2020 requirement this is however less dramatic than it may appear analysts say because energy initiatives already under way in europe under the 202020 plan coupled with a regionwide economic slowdown will make a 40 reduction quite feasible without staggering effort meanwhile other aspects of the plan are downright worrisome there is no mandate for a further increase in energy efficiency and far more important the mandate for increased reliance on renewables at 27 a significant gain is not binding on individual states but on the eu as a whole this makes both implementation and enforcement questionable matters jens tartler a spokesperson for the german renewable energy federation which represents that countrys wind and solar industries called the lack of binding national goals for renewables totally disappointing claiming it would contribute to a marked reduction in the pace of expansion of renewables to explain this evident slackening in europes climate commitment analysts point to the immense pressures being brought by manufacturers and others who decry the regions rising energy prices caused in part by increased subsidies for renewables behind the heated debate in brussels about climate and renewable energy targets what is really happening is that concern over high energy prices has taken precedence over climate concerns in europe says sonja van renssen the brussels correspondent for energy post an online journal many eu member states and industry fear that a strong climate and energy policy will be bad for their economies in arguing their case proponents of diluted climate goals note that eu policies have raised the cost of producing a metric ton of aluminum in europe by 11 and that european steel companies pay twice as much for electricity and four times as much for natural gas as their us counterparts these and similar phenomena are dragging the eu economy down wrote mark c lewis former head of energy research at deutsche bank not surprisingly many european manufacturers seek to reduce subsidies for renewables and urge greater reliance on lesscostly fossil fuels in particular some officials including british prime minister david cameron are eager to follow the us lead and bring advanced technologies like hydrofracking to bear on the extraction of more oil and natural gas from europes domestic reserves europes hydrocarbons production is in decline noted fatih birol the chief economist at the international energy agency but there may be some opportunities to slow down and perhaps reverse some of these trends notably by imitating the revolution in hydrocarbon production now under way in the united states read this another way and a new and truly unsettling meaning emerges the shale gas revolution being promoted with such fervor by president obama as a bridge to a more climatefriendly energy system in the united states is having the opposite effect in europe it is weakening the eus commitment to renewable energy and threatens to increase europes reliance on fossil fuels canadas endrun around keystone xl pipeline opposition much to the surprise of everyone climate activists in the united states led by environmental author and activist bill mckibben and the action group he helped to found 350org have succeeded in delaying us government approval of the keystone xl pipeline for more than two years once considered a sure thing the pipeline if completed will carry 830000 barrels per day of diluted bitumen syncrude some 1700 miles from the athabasca tar sands in alberta to refineries on the us gulf coast it has however been held up by detailed environmental impact studies and other procedural steps ordered by the us state department because the pipeline will cross an international boundary it requires approval from the secretary of state and ultimately the president but not congress opponents of the pipeline claim that by facilitating the exploitation of particularly carbondense canadian tar sands it will substantially increase greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere the use of this bitumenbased fuel releases more carbon per unit of energy than conventional petroleum and its energyintensive extraction generates additional carbon emissions should all of the bitumen in canada the equivalent of 1 trillion barrels of oil be consumed its game over for the climate as former nasa climate scientist james hansen has famously written how the obama administration will come down on keystone xl is still unknown in a speech on climate policy last june the president indicated that he would give highest priority to climate considerations when deciding on the pipeline allowing the keystone pipeline to be built requires a finding that doing so would be in our nations interest he said and our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution at the time his comments raised the hopes of climate activists that obama would ultimately decide against the pipeline more recently however an environmental assessment conducted at the behest of the state department and released on january 31st cast doubt on this outcome the reports reasoning even though the exploitation of canadas tar sands will increase the pace of carbon emissions their extraction and delivery to refineries is assured by alternative means mainly rail if the pipeline isnt built and so its construction will not significantly exacerbate the problem of greenhouse gas emissions while this is certainly a uniquely sophistic and shaky argument it is important to note that the canadian producers and their us partners are indeed attempting to stage an endrun around opposition to the pipeline by increasing their reliance on rail cars to deliver tar sands the indecision on keystone xl really spawned innovation and mobilized alternatives and rail is a clear part of the options available to our industry observed paul reimer senior vice president in charge of transport at cenovus energy a canadian oil company planning to increase rail shipments from 7000 barrels a day to as many as 30000 barrels a day by the end of 2014 other canadian firms have similar expansion plans all told the canadians claim that over the coming years they will be able to increase railcarrying capacity from the current 180000 barrels per day to as much as 900000 barrels or more than would be carried by the pipeline if this were to happen count on one thing rail transport will turn out to have its own problems and its own opposition not surprisingly then canadas oil industry still craves approval for keystone xl as it would allow even greater tar sands exports and legitimize the use of this carbonheavy fuel but the growing reliance on rail transportation does once again demonstrate the powerful gravitational pull of planet carbon at the end of the day theres a consensus among most energy experts that the oil will get shipped to market no matter what says robert mcnally a former energy adviser to president george w bush reducing carbons pull these three recent encounters in the historic struggle to avert the most destructive effects of climate change tell us a great deal about the nature and terrain of the battlefield climate change is not the product of unfortunate meteorological phenomena it is the result of burning massive quantities of carbonbased fuels and spewing the resulting gaseous wastes into the atmosphere as long as governments corporations and consumers prefer carbon as an energy source the war on climate change will be lost and the outcome of that will in turn be calamitous there is only one way to avert the worst effects of climate change make the consumption of carbon unattractive this can be accomplished in part by shaming portraying the producers of carbonrich fuels as the enemies of human health and survival its an approach that has already achieved some modest successes as in the prevention until now of keystones construction withdrawing funds from fossil fuel firms or disinvestment is another useful approach many student and religious groups are attempting to hinder oil drilling activities by pushing their colleges and congregations to move their investment funds elsewhere but shaming and disinvestment campaigns are insufficient much tougher sanctions are required to stop the incineration of our planet carbon must be made expensive so costly in fact that renewables become the common fuel of choice there are at least two ways to move toward accomplishing this impose a tax on carbon emissions raising the cost of fossil fuels above those of renewables or adopt a universal capandtrade system forcing major carbon emitters to buy permits at everincreasing cost in order to release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere both measures have been advocated by environmentalists and some attempts have been made to institute each of them both california and the european union for example are implementing capandtrade systems there may be other approaches to the problem that could prove even more effective but the most essential thing is to recognize that genuine progress on climate change will not be possible until carbon fuels lose their financial allure for this to happen as bps dudley begrudgingly acknowledged on january 15th you need carbon pricing universally accepted carbon pricing the gravitational pull of carbon is immensely powerful it can not be overcome by symbolic gestures or half measures the pressures to keep burning fossil fuels are too great to be overcome in piecemeal fashion rather these forces must be met headon with the institutionalization of equally powerful counterforces that make fossil fuels economically unattractive we humans have a choice we can succumb to carbons gravitational pull and so suffer from increasingly harsh planetary conditions or resist and avoid the most deadly consequences of climate change michael t klare a tomdispatch regular is a

            "text": "Listening to President Obama’s State of the Union address, it would have been easy to conclude that we were slowly but surely gaining in the war on climate change.  “Our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet,” the president said.  “Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.”  Indeed, it’s true that in recent years, largely thanks to the dampening effects of the Great Recession, U.S. carbon emissions were in decline (though they grew by 2% in 2013).  Still, whatever the president may claim, we’re not heading toward a “cleaner, safer planet.”  If anything, we’re heading toward a dirtier, more dangerous world.\n\nA series of recent developments highlight the way we are losing ground in the epic struggle to slow global warming.  This has not been for lack of effort.  Around the world, dedicated organizations, communities, and citizens have been working day by day to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote the use of renewable sources of energy.  The struggle to prevent construction of the Keystone XL tar-sands pipeline is a case in point.  As noted in a recent New York Times article, the campaign against that pipeline has galvanized the environmental movement around the country and attracted thousands of activists to Washington, D.C., for protests and civil disobedience at the White House.  But efforts like these, heroic as they may be, are being overtaken by a more powerful force: the gravitational pull of cheap, accessible carbon-based fuels, notably oil, coal, and natural gas.\n\nIn the past few years, the ever more widespread use of new extractive technologies -- notably hydraulic fracturing (to exploit shale deposits) and steam-assisted gravity drainage (for tar sands) -- has led to a significant increase in fossil fuel production, especially in North America.  This has left in the dust the likelihood of an imminent “peak” in global oil and gas output and introduced an alternative narrative -- much promoted by the energy industry and its boosters -- of unlimited energy supplies that will last into the distant future.  Barry Smitherman of the Texas Railroad Commission (which regulates that state’s oil industry) was typical in hailing a “relatively boundless supply” of oil and gas worldwide at a recent meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists.\n\nAs oil and gas have proven unexpectedly abundant and affordable, major energy consumers are planning to rely on them more -- and on renewable sources of energy less -- to meet their future requirements.  As a result, the promises we once heard of a substantial decline in fossil fuel use (along with a corresponding boom in renewables) are fading.  According to the most recent projections from the U.S. Department of Energy, global fossil fuel consumption is expected to grow by an astonishing 40% by 2035, jumping from 440 to 615 quadrillion British thermal units.\n\nWhile the combined share of total world energy that comes from fossil fuels will decline slightly -- from 84% to 79% -- they will still dominate the global energy marketplace for decades to come.  Renewables, according to these projections, will continue to represent only a small fraction of the total.  If this proves to be accurate, there can be only one plausible outcome: vastly increased carbon emissions leading to rising temperatures and the sort of catastrophic climate change scenarios that now seem almost impossible to imagine.\n\nThink of it this way: in our world, the gravitational pull of carbon exerts itself every minute of every day, shaping the energy decisions of individuals, companies, institutions, and governments.  This pull is leading to defeat in the global struggle to slow the advance of severe climate change and is reflected in three recent developments in the energy news: a declaration of surrender by BP, a major setback in the European Union, and a strategic end-run by Canadian tar sands companies.\n\nEvery year, energy giant BP (once British Petroleum) releases its “Energy Outlook” for the years ahead, an analysis of future trends in global production and consumption.  The 2014 report -- extending BP’s energy forecast to the year 2035 -- was made public on January 15th.  Typically, its release is accompanied by a press conference in which top BP executives offer commentary on the state of world energy, usually aimed at the business media.  This year, the company’s CEO, Bob Dudley, spoke with unbridled optimism about the future market for his company’s energy products, assuring his audience that the global supply of fossil fuels would remain substantial for years to come.  (Dudley took over the helm at BP after his predecessor, Tony Hayward, was dumped in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\n“The picture in terms of resources in the ground is a good one,” he noted.  “It’s very different to past concerns about supply peaking.  The theory of peak oil seems to have -- well -- peaked.”\n\nThis, no doubt, produced the requisite smiles from Dudley’s oil-friendly audience.  Then his comments took a darker turn.  Can we satisfy the world’s energy requirements with fuels that are sustainable, he asked.  “Not at the moment,” he admitted.  Because of a rising tide of fossil fuel consumption, he added, “carbon emissions are currently projected to rise -- by 29% by 2035, we estimate in the Outlook.”  He acknowledged that, whatever good news might be found in that document, in this area “steps are needed to change the forecast.”\n\nNext, Dudley tried to put a hopeful spin on the long-term climate prospect.  By replacing coal-fired power plants with less-carbon-polluting natural gas, he indicated, overall greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced.  Increasing the efficiency of energy-consuming devices, he added, will also help.  All of this, however, adds up to little when it comes to the big picture of carbon emissions.  In the end, he could point to few signs of progress in the struggle to slow the advance of climate change.  “In 2035, we project that gas and coal will account for 54% of global energy demand [and oil another 27%].  While renewables will grow rapidly, their share will reach just 7%.”\n\nMost of the media coverage of Dudley’s appearance focused on his expectations of long-term energy abundance, not what it would do to us or our planet.  Several commentators were, however, quick to note how unusual it was for an oil company CEO to address the problem of carbon emissions at all, no less express something verging on despair over the prospect of making any progress in curbing them.\n\n“[Dudley] concludes... [that] the world is still a long way from delivering the peak in greenhouse gas emissions many scientists advise has to be achieved within the next decade to minimize the risk of dangerous climate change,” observed energy analyst James Murray at businessGreen.com.\n\nThe member states of the European Union (EU) have long exercised global leadership in the struggle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the pace of climate change.  Under their justly celebrated 20-20-20 plan, adopted in December 2008, they are committed to reducing their emissions by 20% over 1990 levels by 2020, increasing their overall energy efficiency by 20%, and achieving 20% reliance on renewables in total energy consumption.  No other region has embraced goals as ambitious as these, and none has invested greater resources in their implementation.  Any wavering from this path would signal a significant retrenchment in the global climate struggle.\n\nIt now appears that Europe is preparing to rein in the pace of its drive to slow global warming.  At issue is not the implementation of the 20-20-20 plan, which is well on its way to being achieved, but on the goals that should follow it.  Climate activists and green energy entrepreneurs have been calling for an even more ambitious set of targets for 2030 and beyond; many manufacturers and other major energy consumers have been pushing for a slower pace of change, claiming that increased reliance on renewables is driving up energy prices and so diminishing their economic competitiveness.  Already, it appears that the industrialists are gaining ground at the expense of climate action.\n\nAt stake is the EU’s climate blueprint for 2030, the next major threshold in its drive to slow the pace of warming. On January 22nd, the EU’s executive arm, the European Commission (EC), released its guidelines for the new plan, which must still be approved by the EU Parliament and its member states.  While touted by some as a sign of continued European commitment to decisive climate action, the EC’s plan is viewed as a distinct setback by many environmental leaders.\n\nAt first glance, the plan looks promising.  It calls for a 40% reduction in emissions by 2030 -- a huge drop from the 2020 requirement.  This is, however, less dramatic than it may appear, analysts say, because energy initiatives already under way in Europe under the 20-20-20 plan, coupled with a region-wide economic slowdown, will make a 40% reduction quite feasible without staggering effort.  Meanwhile, other aspects of the plan are downright worrisome.  There is no mandate for a further increase in energy efficiency and, far more important, the mandate for increased reliance on renewables -- at 27%, a significant gain -- is not binding on individual states but on the EU as a whole.  This makes both implementation and enforcement questionable matters.  Jens Tartler, a spokesperson for the German Renewable Energy Federation (which represents that country’s wind and solar industries), called the lack of binding national goals for renewables “totally disappointing,” claiming it would “contribute to a marked reduction in the pace of expansion of renewables.”\n\nTo explain this evident slackening in Europe’s climate commitment, analysts point to the immense pressures being brought by manufacturers and others who decry the region’s rising energy prices caused, in part, by increased subsidies for renewables.  “Behind the heated debate in Brussels about climate and renewable energy targets, what is really happening is that concern over high energy prices has taken precedence over climate concerns in Europe,” says Sonja van Renssen, the Brussels correspondent for Energy Post, an online journal.  “Many [EU] member states and industry fear that a strong climate and energy policy will be bad for their economies.”\n\nIn arguing their case, proponents of diluted climate goals note that EU policies have raised the cost of producing a metric ton of aluminum in Europe by 11% and that European steel companies pay twice as much for electricity and four times as much for natural gas as their U.S. counterparts.  These, and similar phenomena, are “dragging the EU economy down,” wrote Mark C. Lewis, former head of energy research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nNot surprisingly, many European manufacturers seek to reduce subsidies for renewables and urge greater reliance on less-costly fossil fuels.  In particular, some officials, including British Prime Minister David Cameron, are eager to follow the U.S. lead and bring advanced technologies like hydro-fracking to bear on the extraction of more oil and natural gas from Europe’s domestic reserves.  “Europe’s hydrocarbons production is in decline,” noted Fatih Birol, the chief economist at the International Energy Agency, but “there may be some opportunities... to slow down and perhaps reverse some of these trends” -- notably by imitating the “revolution in hydrocarbon production” now under way in the United States.\n\nRead this another way and a new and truly unsettling meaning emerges: the “shale gas revolution” being promoted with such fervor by President Obama as a “bridge” to a more climate-friendly energy system in the United States is having the opposite effect in Europe.  It is weakening the EU’s commitment to renewable energy and threatens to increase Europe’s reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nMuch to the surprise of everyone, climate activists in the United States led by environmental author and activist Bill McKibben and the action group he helped to found, 350.org, have succeeded in delaying U.S. government approval of the Keystone XL pipeline for more than two years.  Once considered a sure thing, the pipeline, if completed, will carry 830,000 barrels per day of diluted bitumen (“syncrude”) some 1,700 miles from the Athabasca tar sands in Alberta to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast.  It has, however, been held up by detailed environmental impact studies and other procedural steps ordered by the U.S. State Department.  (Because the pipeline will cross an international boundary, it requires approval from the Secretary of State and, ultimately, the president, but not Congress.)\n\nOpponents of the pipeline claim that by facilitating the exploitation of particularly carbon-dense Canadian tar sands, it will substantially increase greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.  The use of this bitumen-based fuel releases more carbon per unit of energy than conventional petroleum and its energy-intensive extraction generates additional carbon emissions.  Should all of the bitumen in Canada -- the equivalent of 1 trillion barrels of oil -- be consumed, it’s “game over for the climate,” as former NASA climate scientist James Hansen has famously written.\n\nHow the Obama administration will come down on Keystone XL is still unknown.  In a speech on climate policy last June, the president indicated that he would give highest priority to climate considerations when deciding on the pipeline.  “Allowing the Keystone pipeline to be built requires a finding that doing so would be in our nation’s interest,” he said.  “And our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.”  At the time, his comments raised the hopes of climate activists that Obama would ultimately decide against the pipeline.  More recently, however, an environmental assessment conducted at the behest of the State Department and released on January 31st cast doubt on this outcome.  The report’s reasoning: even though the exploitation of Canada’s tar sands will increase the pace of carbon emissions, their extraction and delivery to refineries is assured by alternative means -- mainly rail -- if the pipeline isn’t built and so its construction will not “significantly exacerbate” the problem of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWhile this is certainly a uniquely sophistic (and shaky) argument, it is important to note that the Canadian producers and their U.S. partners are indeed attempting to stage an end-run around opposition to the pipeline by increasing their reliance on rail cars to deliver tar sands.\n\n“The indecision on Keystone XL really spawned innovation and mobilized alternatives, and rail is a clear part of the options available to our industry,” observed Paul Reimer, senior vice president in charge of transport at Cenovus Energy, a Canadian oil company planning to increase rail shipments from 7,000 barrels a day to as many as 30,000 barrels a day by the end of 2014.  Other Canadian firms have similar expansion plans.  All told, the Canadians claim that, over the coming years, they will be able to increase rail-carrying capacity from the current 180,000 barrels per day to as much as 900,000 barrels, or more than would be carried by the pipeline.\n\nIf this were to happen, count on one thing: rail transport will turn out to have its own problems -- and its own opposition.  Not surprisingly, then, Canada’s oil industry still craves approval for Keystone XL, as it would allow even greater tar sands exports and legitimize the use of this carbon-heavy fuel.  But the growing reliance on rail transportation does once again demonstrate the powerful gravitational pull of Planet Carbon.  “At the end of the day, there’s a consensus among most energy experts that the oil will get shipped to market no matter what,” says Robert McNally, a former energy adviser to President George W. Bush.\n\nThese three recent encounters in the historic struggle to avert the most destructive effects of climate change tell us a great deal about the nature and terrain of the battlefield.  Climate change is not the product of unfortunate meteorological phenomena; it is the result of burning massive quantities of carbon-based fuels and spewing the resulting gaseous wastes into the atmosphere.  As long as governments, corporations, and consumers prefer carbon as an energy source, the war on climate change will be lost and the outcome of that will, in turn, be calamitous.\n\nThere is only one way to avert the worst effects of climate change: make the consumption of carbon unattractive.  This can be accomplished, in part, by shaming -- portraying the producers of carbon-rich fuels as the enemies of human health and survival.  It’s an approach that has already achieved some modest successes, as in the prevention, until now, of Keystone’s construction.  Withdrawing funds from fossil fuel firms, or disinvestment, is another useful approach.  Many student and religious groups are attempting to hinder oil drilling activities by pushing their colleges and congregations to move their investment funds elsewhere.\n\nBut shaming and disinvestment campaigns are insufficient; much tougher sanctions are required.  To stop the incineration of our planet, carbon must be made expensive -- so costly, in fact, that renewables become the common fuel of choice.\n\nThere are at least two ways to move toward accomplishing this: impose a tax on carbon emissions, raising the cost of fossil fuels above those of renewables; or adopt a universal cap-and-trade system, forcing major carbon emitters to buy permits (at ever-increasing cost) in order to release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  Both measures have been advocated by environmentalists and some attempts have been made to institute each of them.  (Both California and the European Union, for example, are implementing cap-and-trade systems.)  There may be other approaches to the problem that could prove even more effective, but the most essential thing is to recognize that genuine progress on climate change will not be possible until carbon fuels lose their financial allure.  For this to happen, as BP’s Dudley begrudgingly acknowledged on January 15th, “you need carbon pricing.  Universally accepted carbon pricing.”\n\nThe gravitational pull of carbon is immensely powerful.  It cannot be overcome by symbolic gestures or half measures.  The pressures to keep burning fossil fuels are too great to be overcome in piecemeal fashion.  Rather, these forces must be met head-on, with the institutionalization of equally powerful counter-forces that make fossil fuels economically unattractive.  We humans have a choice: we can succumb to carbon’s gravitational pull and so suffer from increasingly harsh planetary conditions, or resist and avoid the most deadly consequences of climate change.\n\nMichael T.

that 900000 families would move above the poverty line but that 500000 jobs would be lost how did progressives react to the news nancy pelosi on the minimum wage report the cbo made it absolutely clear raising the minimum wage would lift almost one million americans out of poverty increase the pay of lowincome workers by 31 billion and help build an economy that works for everyone in other words pay no attention to the 500000 people behind the curtain susan caseylefkowitz of the national resources defense council on the pipeline report were taking the inclusion of that scenario as good news – referring to the hypothetical case considered by the state department where future demand for oil is too low to encourage the development of the canadian oil fields absent the pipeline in other words imagine a world where the facts fit ones predetermined values of course progressives have no monopoly on selective citation of favorable data or selective noncitation of unfavorable data but it is important to note their departures from the realitybased community because of the pretense of scientific objectivity so central to their nonideology for a century progressives have placed great confidence in the ability of the social sciences to craft policies capable of mitigating or eliminating economic social and environmental problems more than that they have become experts in divining

When the unrepentant blind demur, Progressives can claim at least a moral right to shut down debate–after all, there is no reason to pretend that those who ignore the facts have any real standing to dispute Progressive findings.\n\nFor a century, Progressives have placed great confidence in the ability of the social sciences to craft policies capable of mitigating or eliminating economic, social, and environmental problems. More than that, they have become experts in divining the course of History and dividing its Right Side from its Wrong. Thus, as Irving Kristol taught us years ago, the New Left resembles the Old [pre-Enlightenment] Right in that it “seeks to end the sovereignty over our civilization of the common man.”\n\nMadison’s Federalist 37 is the introductory essay to the second half of The Federalist, which amounts to a clause by clause defense of the Constitution. But was every clause equally defensible? No. Every intelligent reader could find six or eight or ten parts of the Constitution to object to, which might have left the cause of ratification to die the death of a thousand cuts. Madison rightly feared this result and so wrote Federalist 37 to put the American public on their guard against expecting too much of the Constitution–and, more importantly, being too confident in their own judgment.\n\nBesides the obscurity arising from the complexity of objects, and the imperfection of the human faculties, the medium through which the conceptions of men are conveyed to each other adds a fresh embarrassment. The use of words is to express ideas. Perspicuity, therefore, requires not only that the ideas should be distinctly formed, but that they should be expressed by words distinctly and exclusively appropriate to them. But no language is so copious as to supply words and phrases for every complex idea, or so correct as not to include many equivocally denoting different ideas. Hence it must happen that however accurately objects may be discriminated in themselves, and however accurately the discrimination may be considered, the definition of them may be rendered inaccurate by the inaccuracy of the terms in which it is delivered. And this unavoidable inaccuracy must be greater or less, according to the complexity and novelty of the objects defined.\n\nWhat Madison asked his reader to do was to consider well his own fallibility and the other inherent limits to political knowledge before reading and evaluating the Constitution. In doing so, he was only asking them to do what he had already done. Madison’s example exposes the striking contrast between the epistemic humility of the American founders and the epistemic arrogance of the hyper-oligarchs (the Old Right) and the hyper-democrats (the New Left) who came before and after them, respectively.\n\nWe know from public and private records that Madison had serious reservations about several parts of the Constitution, especially the equal weight given to the states in the senate. He feared that that unjust departure from republican principle combined with the absence of a federal veto over state legislation (included in his original draft for the Constitution) would undermine–perhaps fatally–efforts to arrest the American descent into anarchy so evident, at least to Madison, under the Articles of Confederation.

At first glance, this seems like an easy matter to resolve. Give the national government authority over those public matters that require concerted action and leave the rest to the states. But try to get more specific and all kinds of difficulties arise.\n\nFirst, there is the possibility that no black and white distinction between state and national authority exists.

But even if there were such a formula, we may very easily fail to perceive it. Suppose one manages even that. It means nothing unless you can convince a room full of fellow statesmen (who bring their own ideas and local interests with them) that you’re right. Still one thing more: you’ll have to reduce your idea to words left on a page for posterity–words, as Madison notes, that themselves can be sources of obscurity and ambiguity. Put it all together and it is hardly surprising that Madison supposed that only the help of God’s “Almighty hand” could explain the unity and wisdom actually achieved by the Constitutional Convention.\n\nProgressives enter the political arena with much less fear and trembling. In the spirit of FDR, they think that “trying something,” so long as it can make its way through their postmodern egalitarian filter, is always just, no matter its consequences. And if the facts don’t fit, we should still submit, since a Progressive intention, not a predictable positive consequence, is the measure of political rectitude.\n\nWhat else explains perhaps last week’s most striking example of Progressive moral preening? During oral arguments in the Hobby Lobby case, Justice Elena Kagan suggested that $26 million in fines and a “good luck on healthcare.gov” email to its 13,000 employees was a small price to exact from the Christian corporation for opposing its claims of conscience to Progressive “reproductive freedom” orthodoxy. Be grateful for the mercy of the Administration’s almighty hand in allowing any departure from imperial Obamacare policy–and pray that we don’t homogenize you any further.\n\nProgressive overconfidence shows itself most obviously in their serial efforts to remake American society, but most ominously in their lack of tolerance for those who endanger their deepest commitments. The measure of a man (or a movement) is not what he will plead when he is weak, but what he will do when he is strong. From powerful corporations like Hobby Lobby to all but powerless bakers in Oregon more and more have seen what happens when the Progressive mask is removed and those who asked only for toleration half a generation ago enforce an ever-narrowing conformity today.",

been for lack of effort around the world dedicated organizations communities and citizens have been working day by day to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote the use of renewable sources of energy the struggle to prevent construction of the keystone xl tarsands pipeline is a case in point as noted in a recent new york times article the campaign against that pipeline has galvanized the environmental movement around the country and attracted thousands of activists to washington dc for protests and civil disobedience at the white house but efforts like these heroic as they may be are being overtaken by a more powerful force the gravitational pull of cheap accessible carbonbased fuels notably oil coal and natural gas listening to president obamas state of the union address it would have been easy to conclude that we were slowly but surely gaining in the war on climate change our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner safer planet the president said over the past eight years the united states has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on earth indeed its true that in recent years largely thanks to the dampening effects of the great recession us carbon emissions were in decline though they grew by 2 percent in 2013 still whatever the president may claim were not heading toward a cleaner safer planet if anything were heading toward a dirtier more dangerous world in the past few years the ever more widespread use of new extractive technologies—notably hydraulic fracturing to exploit shale deposits and steamassisted gravity drainage for tar sands—has led to a significant increase in fossil fuel production especially in north america this has left in the dust the likelihood of an imminent peak in global oil and gas output and introduced an alternative narrative—much promoted by the energy industry and its boosters—of unlimited energy supplies that will last into the distant future barry smitherman of the texas railroad commission which regulates that states oil industry was typical in hailing a relatively boundless supply of oil and gas worldwide at a recent meeting of the society of exploration geophysicists as oil and gas have proven unexpectedly abundant and affordable major energy consumers are planning to rely on them more—and on renewable sources of energy less—to meet their future requirements as a result the promises we once heard of a substantial decline in fossil fuel use along with a corresponding boom in renewables are fading according to the most recent projections from the us department of energy global fossil fuel consumption is expected to grow by an astonishing 40 percent by 2035 jumping from 440 to 615 quadrillion british thermal units while the combined share of total world energy that comes from fossil fuels will decline slightly—from 84 percent to 79 percent—they will still dominate the global energy marketplace for decades to come renewables according to these projections will continue to represent only a small fraction of the total if this proves to be accurate there can be only one plausible outcome vastly increased carbon emissions leading to rising temperatures and the sort of catastrophic climate change scenarios that now seem almost impossible to imagine think of it this way in our world the gravitational pull of carbon exerts itself every minute of every day shaping the energy decisions of individuals companies institutions and governments this pull is leading to defeat in the global struggle to slow the advance of severe climate change and is reflected in three recent developments in the energy news a declaration of surrender by bp a major setback in the european union and a strategic endrun by canadian tar sands companies every year energy giant bp once british petroleum releases its energy outlook for the years ahead an analysis of future trends in global production and consumption the 2014 report—extending bps energy forecast to the year 2035—was made public on january 15th typically its release is accompanied by a press conference in which top bp executives offer commentary on the state of world energy usually aimed at the business media this year the companys ceo bob dudley spoke with unbridled optimism about the future market for his companys energy products assuring his audience that the global supply of fossil fuels would remain substantial for years to come dudley took over the helm at bp after his predecessor tony hayward was dumped in the wake of the 2010 deepwater horizon disaster in the gulf of mexico the picture in terms of resources in the ground is a good one he noted its very different to past concerns about supply peaking the theory of peak oil seems to have—well—peaked this no doubt produced the requisite smiles from dudleys oilfriendly audience then his comments took a darker turn can we satisfy the worlds energy requirements with fuels that are sustainable he asked not at the moment he admitted because of a rising tide of fossil fuel consumption he added carbon emissions are currently projected to rise—by 29 percent by 2035 we estimate in the outlook he acknowledged that whatever good news might be found in that document in this area steps are needed to change the forecast next dudley tried to put a hopeful spin on the longterm climate prospect by replacing coalfired power plants with lesscarbonpolluting natural gas he indicated overall greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced increasing the efficiency of energyconsuming devices he added will also help all of this however adds up to little when it comes to the big picture of carbon emissions in the end he could point to few signs of progress in the struggle to slow the advance of climate change in 2035 we project that gas and coal will account for 54 percent of global energy demand and oil another 27 percent while renewables will grow rapidly their share will reach just 7 percent most of the media coverage of dudleys appearance focused on his expectations of longterm energy abundance not what it would do to us or our planet several commentators were however quick to note how unusual it was for an oil company ceo to address the problem of carbon emissions at all no less express something verging on despair over the prospect of making any progress in curbing them dudley concludesthat the world is still a long way from delivering the peak in greenhouse gas emissions many scientists advise has to be achieved within the next decade to minimize the risk of dangerous climate change observed energy analyst james murray at businessgreencom the member states of the european union eu have long exercised global leadership in the struggle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the pace of climate change under their justly celebrated 202020 plan adopted in december 2008 they are committed to reducing their emissions by 20 percent over 1990 levels by 2020 increasing their overall energy efficiency by 20 percent and achieving 20 percent reliance on renewables in total energy consumption no other region has embraced goals as ambitious as these and none has invested greater resources in their implementation any wavering from this path would signal a significant retrenchment in the global climate struggle it now appears that europe is preparing to rein in the pace of its drive to slow global warming at issue is not the implementation of the 202020 plan which is well on its way to being achieved but on the goals that should follow it climate activists and green energy entrepreneurs have been calling for an even more ambitious set of targets for 2030 and beyond many manufacturers and other major energy consumers have been pushing for a slower pace of change claiming that increased reliance on renewables is driving up energy prices and so diminishing their economic competitiveness already it appears that the industrialists are gaining ground at the expense of climate action at stake is the eus climate blueprint for 2030 the next major threshold in its drive to slow the pace of warming on january 22nd the eus executive arm the european commission ec released its guidelines for the new plan which must still be approved by the eu parliament and its member states while touted by some as a sign of continued european commitment to decisive climate action the ecs plan is viewed as a distinct setback by many environmental leaders at first glance the plan looks promising it calls for a 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2030—a huge drop from the 2020 requirement this is however less dramatic than it may appear analysts say because energy initiatives already under way in europe under the 202020 plan coupled with a regionwide economic slowdown will make a 40 percent reduction quite feasible without staggering effort meanwhile other aspects of the plan are downright worrisome there is no mandate for a further increase in energy efficiency and far more important the mandate for increased reliance on renewables—at 27 percent a significant gain—is not binding on individual states but on the eu as a whole this makes both implementation and enforcement questionable matters jens tartler a spokesperson for the german renewable energy federation which represents that countrys wind and solar industries called the lack of binding national goals for renewables totally disappointing claiming it would contribute to a marked reduction in the pace of expansion of renewables to explain this evident slackening in europes climate commitment analysts point to the immense pressures being brought by manufacturers and others who decry the regions rising energy prices caused in part by increased subsidies for renewables behind the heated debate in brussels about climate and renewable energy targets what is really happening is that concern over high energy prices has taken precedence over climate concerns in europe says sonja van renssen the brussels correspondent for energy post an online journal many eu member states and industry fear that a strong climate and energy policy will be bad for their economies in arguing their case proponents of diluted climate goals note that eu policies have raised the cost of producing a metric ton of aluminum in europe by 11 percent and that european steel companies pay twice as much for electricity and four times as much for natural gas as their us counterparts these and similar phenomena are dragging the eu economy down wrote mark c lewis former head of energy research at deutsche bank not surprisingly many european manufacturers seek to reduce subsidies for renewables and urge greater reliance on lesscostly fossil fuels in particular some officials including british prime minister david cameron are eager to follow the us lead and bring advanced technologies like hydrofracking to bear on the extraction of more oil and natural gas from europes domestic reserves europes hydrocarbons production is in decline noted fatih birol the chief economist at the international energy agency but there may be some opportunitiesto slow down and perhaps reverse some of these trends—notably by imitating the revolution in hydrocarbon production now under way in the united states read this another way and a new and truly unsettling meaning emerges the shale gas revolution being promoted with such fervor by president obama as a bridge to a more climatefriendly energy system in the united states is having the opposite effect in europe it is weakening the eus commitment to renewable energy and threatens to increase europes reliance on fossil fuels much to the surprise of everyone climate activists in the united states led by environmental author and activist bill mckibben and the action group he helped to found 350org have succeeded in delaying us government approval of the keystone xl pipeline for more than two years once considered a sure thing the pipeline if completed will carry 830000 barrels per day of diluted bitumen syncrude some 1700 miles from the athabasca tar sands in alberta to refineries on the us gulf coast it has however been held up by detailed environmental impact studies and other procedural steps ordered by the us state department because the pipeline will cross an international boundary it requires approval from the secretary of state and ultimately the president but not congress opponents of the pipeline claim that by facilitating the exploitation of particularly carbondense canadian tar sands it will substantially increase greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere the use of this bitumenbased fuel releases more carbon per unit of energy than conventional petroleum and its energyintensive extraction generates additional carbon emissions should all of the bitumen in canada—the equivalent of 1 trillion barrels of oil—be consumed its game over for the climate as former nasa climate scientist james hansen has famously written how the obama administration will come down on keystone xl is still unknown in a speech on climate policy last june the president indicated that he would give highest priority to climate considerations when deciding on the pipeline allowing the keystone pipeline to be built requires a finding that doing so would be in our nations interest he said and our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution at the time his comments raised the hopes of climate activists that obama would ultimately decide against the pipeline more recently however an environmental assessment conducted at the behest of the state department and released on january 31st cast doubt on this outcome the reports reasoning even though the exploitation of canadas tar sands will increase the pace of carbon emissions their extraction and delivery to refineries is assured by alternative means—mainly rail—if the pipeline isnt built and so its construction will not significantly exacerbate the problem of greenhouse gas emissions while this is certainly a uniquely sophistic and shaky argument it is important to note that the canadian producers and their us partners are indeed attempting to stage an endrun around opposition to the pipeline by increasing their reliance on rail cars to deliver tar sands the indecision on keystone xl really spawned innovation and mobilized alternatives and rail is a clear part of the options available to our industry observed paul reimer senior vice president in charge of transport at cenovus energy a canadian oil company planning to increase rail shipments from 7000 barrels a day to as many as 30000 barrels a day by the end of 2014 other canadian firms have similar expansion plans all told the canadians claim that over the coming years they will be able to increase railcarrying capacity from the current 180000 barrels per day to as much as 900000 barrels or more than would be carried by the pipeline if this were to happen count on one thing rail transport will turn out to have its own problems—and its own opposition not surprisingly then canadas oil industry still craves approval for keystone xl as it would allow even greater tar sands exports and legitimize the use of this carbonheavy fuel but the growing reliance on rail transportation does once again demonstrate the powerful gravitational pull of planet carbon at the end of the day theres a consensus among most energy experts that the oil will get shipped to market no matter what says robert mcnally a former energy adviser to president george w bush these three recent encounters in the historic struggle to avert the most destructive effects of climate change tell us a great deal about the nature and terrain of the battlefield climate change is not the product of unfortunate meteorological phenomena it is the result of burning massive quantities of carbonbased fuels and spewing the resulting gaseous wastes into the atmosphere as long as governments corporations and consumers prefer carbon as an energy source the war on climate change will be lost and the outcome of that will in turn be calamitous there is only one way to avert the worst effects of climate change make the consumption of carbon unattractive this can be accomplished in part by shaming—portraying the producers of carbonrich fuels as the enemies of human health and survival its an approach that has already achieved some modest successes as in the prevention until now of keystones construction withdrawing funds from fossil fuel firms or disinvestment is another useful approach many student and religious groups are attempting to hinder oil drilling activities by pushing their colleges and congregations to move their investment funds elsewhere but shaming and disinvestment campaigns are insufficient much tougher sanctions are required to stop the incineration of our planet carbon must be made

            "text": "A series of recent developments highlight the way we are losing ground in the epic struggle to slow global warming. This has not been for lack of effort. Around the world, dedicated organizations, communities, and citizens have been working day by day to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote the use of renewable sources of energy. The struggle to prevent construction of the Keystone XL tar-sands pipeline is a case in point. As noted in a recent New York Times article, the campaign against that pipeline has galvanized the environmental movement around the country and attracted thousands of activists to Washington, D.C., for protests and civil disobedience at the White House. But efforts like these, heroic as they may be, are being overtaken by a more powerful force: the gravitational pull of cheap, accessible carbon-based fuels, notably oil, coal, and natural gas.\n\nListening to President Obama's State of the Union address, it would have been easy to conclude that we were slowly but surely gaining in the war on climate change. \"Our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet,\" the president said. \"Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth.\" Indeed, it's true that in recent years, largely thanks to the dampening effects of the Great Recession, US carbon emissions were in decline (though they grew by 2 percent in 2013). Still, whatever the president may claim, we're not heading toward a \"cleaner, safer planet.\" If anything, we're heading toward a dirtier, more dangerous world.\n\nIn the past few years, the ever more widespread use of new extractive technologies—notably hydraulic fracturing (to exploit shale deposits) and steam-assisted gravity drainage (for tar sands)—has led to a significant increase in fossil fuel production, especially in North America. This has left in the dust the likelihood of an imminent \"peak\" in global oil and gas output and introduced an alternative narrative—much promoted by the energy industry and its boosters—of unlimited energy supplies that will last into the distant future. Barry Smitherman of the Texas Railroad Commission (which regulates that state's oil industry) was typical in hailing a \"relatively boundless supply\" of oil and gas worldwide at a recent meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists.\n\nAs oil and gas have proven unexpectedly abundant and affordable, major energy consumers are planning to rely on them more—and on renewable sources of energy less—to meet their future requirements. As a result, the promises we once heard of a substantial decline in fossil fuel use (along with a corresponding boom in renewables) are fading. According to the most recent projections from the US Department of Energy, global fossil fuel consumption is expected to grow by an astonishing 40 percent by 2035, jumping from 440 to 615 quadrillion British thermal units.\n\nWhile the combined share of total world energy that comes from fossil fuels will decline slightly—from 84 percent to 79 percent—they will still dominate the global energy marketplace for decades to come. Renewables, according to these projections, will continue to represent only a small fraction of the total. If this proves to be accurate, there can be only one plausible outcome: vastly increased carbon emissions leading to rising temperatures and the sort of catastrophic climate change scenarios that now seem almost impossible to imagine.\n\nThink of it this way: in our world, the gravitational pull of carbon exerts itself every minute of every day, shaping the energy decisions of individuals, companies, institutions, and governments. This pull is leading to defeat in the global struggle to slow the advance of severe climate change and is reflected in three recent developments in the energy news: a declaration of surrender by BP, a major setback in the European Union, and a strategic end-run by Canadian tar sands companies.\n\nEvery year, energy giant BP (once British Petroleum) releases its \"Energy Outlook\" for the years ahead, an analysis of future trends in global production and consumption. The 2014 report—extending BP's energy forecast to the year 2035—was made public on January 15th. Typically, its release is accompanied by a press conference in which top BP executives offer commentary on the state of world energy, usually aimed at the business media. This year, the company's CEO, Bob Dudley, spoke with unbridled optimism about the future market for his company's energy products, assuring his audience that the global supply of fossil fuels would remain substantial for years to come. (Dudley took over the helm at BP after his predecessor, Tony Hayward, was dumped in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\n\"The picture in terms of resources in the ground is a good one,\" he noted. \"It's very different to past concerns about supply peaking. The theory of peak oil seems to have—well—peaked.\"\n\nThis, no doubt, produced the requisite smiles from Dudley's oil-friendly audience. Then his comments took a darker turn. Can we satisfy the world's energy requirements with fuels that are sustainable, he asked. \"Not at the moment,\" he admitted. Because of a rising tide of fossil fuel consumption, he added, \"carbon emissions are currently projected to rise—by 29 percent by 2035, we estimate in the Outlook.\" He acknowledged that, whatever good news might be found in that document, in this area \"steps are needed to change the forecast.\"\n\nNext, Dudley tried to put a hopeful spin on the long-term climate prospect. By replacing coal-fired power plants with less-carbon-polluting natural gas, he indicated, overall greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced. Increasing the efficiency of energy-consuming devices, he added, will also help. All of this, however, adds up to little when it comes to the big picture of carbon emissions. In the end, he could point to few signs of progress in the struggle to slow the advance of climate change. \"In 2035, we project that gas and coal will account for 54 percent of global energy demand [and oil another 27 percent]. While renewables will grow rapidly, their share will reach just 7 percent.\"\n\nMost of the media coverage of Dudley's appearance focused on his expectations of long-term energy abundance, not what it would do to us or our planet. Several commentators were, however, quick to note how unusual it was for an oil company CEO to address the problem of carbon emissions at all, no less express something verging on despair over the prospect of making any progress in curbing them.\n\n\"[Dudley] concludes…[that] the world is still a long way from delivering the peak in greenhouse gas emissions many scientists advise has to be achieved within the next decade to minimize the risk of dangerous climate change,\" observed energy analyst James Murray at businessGreen.com.\n\nThe member states of the European Union (EU) have long exercised global leadership in the struggle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the pace of climate change. Under their justly celebrated 20-20-20 plan, adopted in December 2008, they are committed to reducing their emissions by 20 percent over 1990 levels by 2020, increasing their overall energy efficiency by 20 percent, and achieving 20 percent reliance on renewables in total energy consumption. No other region has embraced goals as ambitious as these, and none has invested greater resources in their implementation. Any wavering from this path would signal a significant retrenchment in the global climate struggle.\n\nIt now appears that Europe is preparing to rein in the pace of its drive to slow global warming. At issue is not the implementation of the 20-20-20 plan, which is well on its way to being achieved, but on the goals that should follow it. Climate activists and green energy entrepreneurs have been calling for an even more ambitious set of targets for 2030 and beyond; many manufacturers and other major energy consumers have been pushing for a slower pace of change, claiming that increased reliance on renewables is driving up energy prices and so diminishing their economic competitiveness. Already, it appears that the industrialists are gaining ground at the expense of climate action.\n\nAt stake is the EU's climate blueprint for 2030, the next major threshold in its drive to slow the pace of warming. On January 22nd, the EU's executive arm, the European Commission (EC), released its guidelines for the new plan, which must still be approved by the EU Parliament and its member states. While touted by some as a sign of continued European commitment to decisive climate action, the EC's plan is viewed as a distinct setback by many environmental leaders.\n\nAt first glance, the plan looks promising. It calls for a 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2030—a huge drop from the 2020 requirement. This is, however, less dramatic than it may appear, analysts say, because energy initiatives already under way in Europe under the 20-20-20 plan, coupled with a region-wide economic slowdown, will make a 40 percent reduction quite feasible without staggering effort. Meanwhile, other aspects of the plan are downright worrisome. There is no mandate for a further increase in energy efficiency and, far more important, the mandate for increased reliance on renewables—at 27 percent, a significant gain—is not binding on individual states but on the EU as a whole. This makes both implementation and enforcement questionable matters. Jens Tartler, a spokesperson for the German Renewable Energy Federation (which represents that country's wind and solar industries), called the lack of binding national goals for renewables \"totally disappointing,\" claiming it would \"contribute to a marked reduction in the pace of expansion of renewables.\"\n\nTo explain this evident slackening in Europe's climate commitment, analysts point to the immense pressures being brought by manufacturers and others who decry the region's rising energy prices caused, in part, by increased subsidies for renewables. \"Behind the heated debate in Brussels about climate and renewable energy targets, what is really happening is that concern over high energy prices has taken precedence over climate concerns in Europe,\" says Sonja van Renssen, the Brussels correspondent for Energy Post, an online journal. \"Many [EU] member states and industry fear that a strong climate and energy policy will be bad for their economies.\"\n\nIn arguing their case, proponents of diluted climate goals note that EU policies have raised the cost of producing a metric ton of aluminum in Europe by 11 percent and that European steel companies pay twice as much for electricity and four times as much for natural gas as their US counterparts. These, and similar phenomena, are \"dragging the EU economy down,\" wrote Mark C. Lewis, former head of energy research at Deutsche Bank.\n\nNot surprisingly, many European manufacturers seek to reduce subsidies for renewables and urge greater reliance on less-costly fossil fuels. In particular, some officials, including British Prime Minister David Cameron, are eager to follow the US lead and bring advanced technologies like hydro-fracking to bear on the extraction of more oil and natural gas from Europe's domestic reserves. \"Europe's hydrocarbons production is in decline,\" noted Fatih Birol, the chief economist at the International Energy Agency, but \"there may be some opportunities…to slow down and perhaps reverse some of these trends\"—notably by imitating the \"revolution in hydrocarbon production\" now under way in the United States.\n\nRead this another way and a new and truly unsettling meaning emerges: the \"shale gas revolution\" being promoted with such fervor by President Obama as a \"bridge\" to a more climate-friendly energy system in the United States is having the opposite effect in Europe. It is weakening the EU's commitment to renewable energy and threatens to increase Europe's reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nMuch to the surprise of everyone, climate activists in the United States led by environmental author and activist Bill McKibben and the action group he helped to found, 350.org, have succeeded in delaying US government approval of the Keystone XL pipeline for more than two years. Once considered a sure thing, the pipeline, if completed, will carry 830,000 barrels per day of diluted bitumen (\"syncrude\") some 1,700 miles from the Athabasca tar sands in Alberta to refineries on the US Gulf Coast. It has, however, been held up by detailed environmental impact studies and other procedural steps ordered by the US State Department. (Because the pipeline will cross an international boundary, it requires approval from the Secretary of State and, ultimately, the president, but not Congress.)\n\nOpponents of the pipeline claim that by facilitating the exploitation of particularly carbon-dense Canadian tar sands, it will substantially increase greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. The use of this bitumen-based fuel releases more carbon per unit of energy than conventional petroleum and its energy-intensive extraction generates additional carbon emissions. Should all of the bitumen in Canada—the equivalent of 1 trillion barrels of oil—be consumed, it's \"game over for the climate,\" as former NASA climate scientist James Hansen has famously written.\n\nHow the Obama administration will come down on Keystone XL is still unknown. In a speech on climate policy last June, the president indicated that he would give highest priority to climate considerations when deciding on the pipeline. \"Allowing the Keystone pipeline to be built requires a finding that doing so would be in our nation's interest,\" he said. \"And our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.\" At the time, his comments raised the hopes of climate activists that Obama would ultimately decide against the pipeline. More recently, however, an environmental assessment conducted at the behest of the State Department and released on January 31st cast doubt on this outcome. The report's reasoning: even though the exploitation of Canada's tar sands will increase the pace of carbon emissions, their extraction and delivery to refineries is assured by alternative means—mainly rail—if the pipeline isn't built and so its construction will not \"significantly exacerbate\" the problem of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWhile this is certainly a uniquely sophistic (and shaky) argument, it is important to note that the Canadian producers and their US partners are indeed attempting to stage an end-run around opposition to the pipeline by increasing their reliance on rail cars to deliver tar sands.\n\n\"The indecision on Keystone XL really spawned innovation and mobilized alternatives, and rail is a clear part of the options available to our industry,\" observed Paul Reimer, senior vice president in charge of transport at Cenovus Energy, a Canadian oil company planning to increase rail shipments from 7,000 barrels a day to as many as 30,000 barrels a day by the end of 2014. Other Canadian firms have similar expansion plans. All told, the Canadians claim that, over the coming years, they will be able to increase rail-carrying capacity from the current 180,000 barrels per day to as much as 900,000 barrels, or more than would be carried by the pipeline.\n\nIf this were to happen, count on one thing: rail transport will turn out to have its own problems—and its own opposition. Not surprisingly, then, Canada's oil industry still craves approval for Keystone XL, as it would allow even greater tar sands exports and legitimize the use of this carbon-heavy fuel. But the growing reliance on rail transportation does once again demonstrate the powerful gravitational pull of Planet Carbon. \"At the end of the day, there's a consensus among most energy experts that the oil will get shipped to market no matter what,\" says Robert McNally, a former energy adviser to President George W. Bush.\n\nThese three recent encounters in the historic struggle to avert the most destructive effects of climate change tell us a great deal about the nature and terrain of the battlefield. Climate change is not the product of unfortunate meteorological phenomena; it is the result of burning massive quantities of carbon-based fuels and spewing the resulting gaseous wastes into the atmosphere. As long as governments, corporations, and consumers prefer carbon as an energy source, the war on climate change will be lost and the outcome of that will, in turn, be calamitous.\n\nThere is only one way to avert the worst effects of climate change: make the consumption of carbon unattractive. This can be accomplished, in part, by shaming—portraying the producers of carbon-rich fuels as the enemies of human health and survival. It's an approach that has already achieved some modest successes, as in the prevention, until now, of Keystone's construction. Withdrawing funds from fossil fuel firms, or disinvestment, is another useful approach. Many student and religious groups are attempting to hinder oil drilling activities by pushing their colleges and congregations to move their investment funds elsewhere.\n\nBut shaming and disinvestment campaigns are insufficient; much tougher sanctions are required. To stop the incineration of our planet, carbon must be made expensive—so costly, in fact, that renewables become the common fuel of choice.\n\nThere are at least two ways to move toward accomplishing this: impose a tax on carbon emissions, raising the cost of fossil fuels above those of renewables; or adopt a universal cap-and-trade system, forcing major carbon emitters to buy permits (at ever-increasing cost) in order to release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Both measures have been advocated by environmentalists and some attempts have been made to institute each of them. (Both California and the European Union, for example, are implementing cap-and-trade systems.) There may be other approaches to the problem that could prove even more effective, but the most essential thing is to recognize that genuine progress on climate change will not be possible until carbon fuels lose their financial allure. For this to happen, as BP's Dudley begrudgingly acknowledged on January 15th, \"you need carbon pricing. Universally accepted carbon pricing.\"\n\nThe gravitational pull of carbon is immensely powerful. It cannot be overcome by symbolic gestures or half measures. The pressures to keep burning fossil fuels are too great to be overcome in piecemeal fashion. Rather, these forces must be met head-on, with the institutionalization of equally powerful counter-forces that make fossil fuels economically unattractive. We humans have a choice: we can succumb to carbon's gravitational pull and so suffer from increasingly harsh planetary conditions, or resist and avoid the most deadly consequences of climate change.\n\nMichael T.

A New York Times article sums up the plan well:\n\nEnvironmentalists said they were dismayed at some of the report’s conclusions and disputed its objectivity, but they also said it offered Mr. Obama reasons to reject the pipeline. They said they planned to intensify efforts to try to influence Mr. Kerry’s decision. For more than two years, environmentalists have protested the project and been arrested in demonstrations against it around the country. But many Republicans and oil industry executives, who support the pipeline because they say it creates jobs and increases supplies from a friendly source of oil, embraced the findings.\n\nHere at GWP, we are involved on a local level with 350-Vermont. A review of our new book, So Little Time, was published on the 350-Vermont website:\n\nSo Little Time: Words and Images for a World in Climate Crisis is a new book from an emerging Vermont publishing company, Green Writers Press. The book is a compilation of poetry and images from many authors and photographers, including the editor himself, Greg Delanty. After about ten minutes of reading ,it was clear that it is more than just a “read”; this book is an experience. It affected me, filling me up with deeper awareness and beauty.\n\nThis book is, quite literally, close to home. Greg Delantey, as editor, collected poetry from a wide range of authors and photographers from across the world. John Elder penned the forward of the book, and Dede Cummings founded Green Writers Press and published the compilation. These participants are all local Vermonters, and they are all actively involved in what we do here at 350 Vermont.\n\nBill McKibben, an “envoy” for the book, stated: “Environmentalists long ago won the scientific battle, but we need to reach people’s hearts as well. This superb volume will do exactly that.” His words ring true. The poems and images reach deep to pull our souls and minds into new dimensions, and they have a personal, healing value for me as I follow the activist path and put in daily efforts for 350 Vermont.\n\nRegardless of the $30 price tag, I strongly suggest you buy it. The proceeds go to 350.org (international), and to 350 Vermont! Think of it as a donation! However, if you can’t afford it, I suggest spending time with the book at a friend’s house, the book store, the library (soon!), or even the 350 Vermont office here in Burlington!\n\n —Joan & Bethany\n\n~~~\n\n We have been invited to do a presentation and workshop on green publishing with the Green Writers Press model at The Bread Loaf Orion Environmental Writers’ Conference this summer!\n\nThe new conference is to be an annual, week-long writers’ conference, based on the Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference model, that’s designed to hone the skills of people interested in producing literary writing about the environment and the natural world.

that todays report means this fight is over and thats the difference between us and them where they see a finish line we see the starting blocks where they see a pipeline route we see homes and farmland where they see an export facility we see a community struggling to breathe where they see an oil patch we see a boreal forest and the violation of treaties where they see a bottom line we see

it is my hope that they took to heart the dramatic and overwhelming testimony they heard from nebraska citizens on that cold day in grand island hopefully those involved in the decision making process will realize that protecting the greatest fresh water aquifer in the western hemisphere from any unnecessary risks of contamination is a no brainer another critical part of the equation that is not included in this or any eis is the issue of individual property rights of american citizens who would be unjustifiably forced to forfeit those rights for this project an export pipeline built by a private for profit corporation should never be granted the power of eminent domain if the president truly values the rights of american citizens along with many of our nations most valuable natural

watching the tarsands spills in michigan and arkansas we know pollution is not localized but rather hurts families and communities president obama said he wants to be able to look his grandkids in the

our kids ken winston policy director for nebraska sierra club contact 4022123737 email protected keystone xl continues to fail all the tests that president obama has said it must pass it clearly fails the climate test that he laid out last summer because every major climate change expert has concluded that it would significantly exacerbate climate change it also fails the test that president obama used when he denied the permit in 2012 because it threatens americas greatest freshwater resource the ogallala aquifer at many points where it is close to the surface and most vulnerable president obama needs deny the permit in order to honor his commitments to the american people to fight climate change and protect our most valuable resources president has all information needed to reject keystone xl tar sands pipeline natural resources defense council nrdc washington – january 31 – the following is a statement by susan caseylefkowitz international program director of the natural resources defense council on the state departments final environmental impact statement for the proposed keystone xl tar sands pipeline even though the state department continues to downplay clear evidence that the keystone xl pipeline would lead to tar sands expansion and significantly worsen carbon pollution it has for the first time acknowledged that the proposed project could accelerate climate change president obama now has all the information he needs to reject the pipeline piping the dirtiest oil on the planet through the heart of america would endanger our farms our communities our fresh water and our climate that is absolutely not in our national interest keystone xl should be rejected nrdc issued a report in october 2013 with the latest information on the climate impacts of the proposed keystone xl pipeline here httpwwwnrdcorgenergykeystonepipelinefilestarsandsclimateimpactsibpdf video of people impacted by the pipeline and tar sands production can be found here httpwwwnrdcorgenergykeystonepipelinetarsandsstories the natural resources defense council is a national nonprofit organization of scientists lawyers and environmental specialists dedicated to protecting public health and the environment founded in 1970 nrdc has 12 million members and online activists served from offices in new york washington chicago los angeles san francisco and beijing approving keystone xl could be the biggest mistake of obamas presidency a state department report fails to take into account the full climate impacts of keystone xl who is obama protecting i have made my position on the keystone xl pipeline quite clear approving this hotly debated pipeline would send america down the wrong path the science tells us now is the time that we should be throwing everything we have into creating a clean 21st century energy economy not doubling down on the dirty energy that is imperiling our planet now that the state department has just released a final environmental impact report on keystone xl which appears to downplay the threat and greatly increases the odds that the obama administration will approve the project i feel i must weigh in once again the simple fact is this if keystone xl is built it will be easier to exploit fossil fuel reserves large enough to drastically destabilize the climate a direct pipeline to refineries and global markets makes the business of polluting the atmosphere that much cheaper and easier the only truly accurate examination of the pipeline would include a full cost accounting its environmental footprint it needs to take into account how much energy is consumed in refining and transporting the crude from oil sands it must acknowledge that the pipeline would lower the cost and raise the convenience of extracting and exporting the incredibly carbonintensive deposits of gas there are two main issues at stake in the keystone xl decision path dependency and us leadership path dependency is the term use to describe the fact that once a policy is put into place it then constrains future options to those within that policy framework more simply the choices we make now determine what choices we get to make in the future a classic example is the qwerty keyboard layout even though this layout may not be the most efficient it was the first one and so it became the standard new keyboard layouts would have to compete with an established format meaning consumers would have to adapt to a new system they had no experience with on the basis solely of legacy inferior standards or policies remain in place more or less out of inertia so looking through the lens of path dependency what does the keystone xl project look like it looks like decades of extracting highco2 fuel at a time when we should be winding down such carbon intensive resource exploitation it looks like decades of oil spills across americas heartland written off as an acceptable side effect of making money it looks like decades of continued political lobbying against any co2limiting regulations if approved and built it looks like the united state is failing to take climate change seriously by virtually guaranteeing the massive canadian oil sands reserved are exploited that im afraid is the real threat of keystone xl – the loss of us status as a global leader as the world looks to 2015 for the establishment of legally binding emissions targets it is looking to the us for inspiration and leadership while opponents of carbon regulations routinely point to china and india as an excuse for further inaction the us is still the dominant force in world politics if obama puts his foot down and tells us the pipeline will not be built he will be telling the world that the united states is committed to a future powered by clean renewable energy for better or for worse as the us goes so goes the planet if the united states takes the climatologically necessary step of preventing the keystone pipeline it sends a message more powerful than any protest watered down regulation or rosy proclamation it says that business as usual is no longer an option it says carbon pollution is a serious problem it says that we will no longer be held hostage by ideologues demanding more fossil fuels or the economy gets it protecting our planet from keystone xl would protect us standing on the global stage and by reassuring all nations that the united states takes climate change seriously it would protect international negotiations from devolving into a finger pointing blame shifting debacle protecting us from keystone xl would protect us from decades of continued foreign influence on us energy policy protecting us from keystone xl would protect us land from oil spills and leaks most importantly protecting us from keystone xl would protect our atmosphere from one of the most carbonintensive fuels ever discovered if the president wont protect us who is he protecting michael mann is distinguished

            "text": "As a new phase of public comments begins, we know the President will be hearing loud and clear that this report is an artifact of a corrupt process, and the pipeline is a disaster for our climate, our communities, and our future.”\n\nThe President says he understands climate and is committed to acting in the interests of posterity and not big donors. That means rejecting Keystone XL, plain and simple. The President and Secretary of State Kerry have all the information they need to reject this pipeline.\n\nThere’s a new scenario we’re seeing grow stronger every day, one of concerned citizens rising up and saying no to Big Oil wrecking our communities and our climate. As recently as two years ago no one in Washington thought this pipeline could be stopped. Importantly, this report also concedes that other pipelines, such as the Northern Gateway, are looking less likely because of strong opposition.\n\nThis report assumes business as usual, which is not surprising for an industry-written report. Despite that, the report concedes that the emissions impact could be “1.3 to 27.4 MMTCO2e annually,”[1] equivalent to as many as 5.7 million new cars.\n\n“The State Department’s review, written by Big Oil’s cronies, presents a fatalistic view of a future devastated by extreme and catastrophic climate change. But we, and millions of Americans, know there is a different way.\n\nOil Change International is a research, communication, and advocacy organization focused on exposing the true costs of fossil fuels and facilitating the coming transition towards clean energy.\n\nToday the State Department released its Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) on Keystone XL, starting the official countdown to a final decision by President Obama on the pipeline.\n\nBig oil hand-picked the reviewers of the pipeline, which means the report avoids taking a stand on the pipeline’s climate impacts — leaving the ball entirely in President Obama’s court. As always, he has all the evidence he needs to reject the pipeline.\n\nThe last time State released an FEIS about Keystone XL in 2011, 59 people were arrested that same day just outside the White House in what was just day 6 of a two week sit-in to stop the pipeline. Those sit-ins grew to actions across the country, which grew to a historic rally that surrounded the White House and forced President Obama to delay the pipeline, keeping millions of barrels of oil in the ground and millions of dollars out of the hands of big oil.\n\nIn other words, today is just the starting point for the next crucial phase of this fight. Together, I believe we can once more stop the pipeline.\n\nWe won’t do it by relying on the State Department, whose process has been riddled with conflicts of interest and big oil’s money. Nor by relying on the President’s good intentions — his lofty rhetoric about climate change has been betrayed too many times by weak action and backtracking.\n\nAs we showed in 2011, the only time you can count on the President is when you have him completely surrounded. And so it’s up to us to mobilize again, and put the pressure on from all sides.\n\nStep one is to show our resolve and disappointment in this broken process. On Monday night, all across the country, people will be gathering to mark this moment together at protest vigils, where we will light the night with our resolve to keep fighting. We need to show the media, big oil and the President that this movement is mobilized and unafraid. Can you be there?\n\nClick here to look for an event near you, and sign up to host if there isn’t one near you: actionnetwork.org/event_ campaigns/kxl-fseis?referrer= 350-org&zipcode=21212\n\nStep two is to set some firm plans. Next Tuesday, Feb 4th the night after the protest vigils, 350 will host an online video chat to lay out some ideas for what we can do to put the pressure on President Obama over the coming months. Click here to RSVP, and we’ll send you a reminder when it happens.\n\nKeystone XL is a critical piece in big oil’s plan to dig up and burn all of the tar sands. We’ll continue to face them down on other fronts too — East, West, South; by rail or pipe — to keep this oil in the ground.\n\nBig oil wants you to believe that today’s report means this fight is over. And that’s the difference between us and them.\n\nWhere they see a finish line, we see the starting blocks. Where they see a pipeline route, we see homes, and farmland. Where they see an export facility, we see a community struggling to breathe. Where they see an oil patch, we see a boreal forest and the violation of treaties.\n\nWhere they see a bottom line, we see our future on the line.",

            "text": "Hugh Pickens DOT Com writes \"Reuters reports that pressure on President Obama to approve the Keystone XL pipeline increased on Friday after a State Department report played down the impact it would have on climate change, irking environmentalists and delighting proponents of the project. The long-awaited environmental impact statement concludes that the Keystone XL pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution, leaving an opening for Obama to approve the politically divisive project as it appears to indicate that the project could pass the criteria Obama set forth in a speech last summer when he said he would approve the 1,700-mile pipeline if it would not 'significantly exacerbate' the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil industry applauded the review. 'After five years and five environmental reviews, time and time again the Department of State analysis has shown that the pipeline is safe for the environment,' says Cindy Schild, the senior manager of refining and oil sands programs at the American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies for the oil industry. Environmentalists say they are dismayed at some of the report's conclusions and disputed its objectivity, and add that the report also offers Obama reasons to reject the pipeline. The report concludes that the process used for producing the oil — by extracting what are called tar sands or oil sands from the Alberta forest — creates about 17 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than traditional oil (PDF). But the report concludes that this heavily polluting oil will still be brought to market. Energy companies are already moving the oil out of Canada by rail. 'At the end of the day, there's a consensus among most energy experts that the oil will get shipped to market no matter what,' says Robert McNally. 'It's less important than I think it was perceived to be a year ago, both politically and on oil markets.'\"",

            "text": "President Barack Obama has released an environmental-impact report that divorces the Keystone XL pipeline from the notion of increasing the rate of Alberta oil sands extraction, therefore potentially removing one of his stated objections to the project.\n\nThe Department of State’s official environmental impact report, under review for months by the Obama administration, concludes that the addition of the pipeline “is unlikely to prompt oil companies to change the rate of their extraction of carbon-heavy tar sands oil,” reported The New York Times, adding that according to the report, “Either way, the tar sands oil, which produces significantly more planet-warming carbon pollution than standard methods of drilling, is coming out of the ground.”\n\nAs the State Department put it in the report’s Executive Summary, “approval or denial of any one crude oil transport project, including the proposed project, is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the United States based on expected oil prices, oil-sands supply costs, transport costs, and supply-demand scenarios.”\n\nLast year Obama stated that he would not approve the $7 billion Keystone XL pipeline—which would carry 830,000 barrels of oil daily for a total of 1,700 miles from the oil sands of Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf of Mexico Coast of Texas—if it would contribute significantly to the levels of carbon in the atmosphere. Oil sands extraction leaves one of the biggest carbon footprints of any human activity, more than conventional drilling does.\n\nRELATED: Obama: No Keystone XL if It Increases Carbon Emissions\n\nMany more steps lie between this report and final approval, The New York Times noted. That includes determining whether the project is in the national interest by evaluating such considerations as the economic impact and the effect that the decision could have on U.S.–Canada relations.\n\nAlso still pending are the results of an investigation into some of the consultants who compiled the environmental report after it surfaced that some of them had worked previously for TransCanada, Keystone XL’s would-be builder. That matter is still being investigated by the Office of Inspector General, The New York Times said.\n\n“If investigators determine a conflict of interest in the preparation of that draft, the State Department may have to conduct a fresh environmental review,” the newspaper said.\n\nObama last summer appeared to snigger at the paltry number of actual jobs that the project would provide, especially permanent ones.\n\nCanada’s patience appears to be wearing thin. On a mid-January visit to Washington, D.C., Foreign Minister Joel Baird told Obama point blank to stop waffling.\n\n“If there’s one message I’m going to be promoting on this trip, it’s time for Keystone right now,” Baird told The Star. “It’ll go further—the time for a decision on Keystone is now, even if it’s not the right one. We can’t continue in this state of limbo.”\n\nThe draft version of the environmental impact statement, released last March 1, concluded that Keystone XL’s effect on both the environment and jobs would be negligible.\n\nRELATED: State Department Draft Environmental Report Says Keystone XL Effects on Both Climate Change and Oil Supply Would Be Minimal\n\nTribal leaders and others alleged the report to be full of holes, inaccuracies and misguided assumptions.\n\nIn the final report, environmental groups are taking heart from the document's admission that continued production in the Alberta oil sands could contribute to climate change, although it stopped short of saying that the rate of climate change would be influenced by the pipeline’s construction and operation alone.\n\n“Even though the State Department continues to downplay clear evidence that the Keystone XL pipeline would lead to tar sands expansion and significantly worsen carbon pollution, it has, for the first time, acknowledged that the proposed project could accelerate climate change,” said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, international program director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. “President Obama now has all the information he needs to reject the pipeline.”\n\nThe full 11-volume report is online under the name Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS).\n\nRELATED: The Truth About Keystone XL: Few Jobs, No Energy Security",

It listed no major environmental objections to the construction of the line, which would transport oil derived from tar sands in western Canada to a hub in Nebraska, where it would connect with other pipelines that would take the oil to the Gulf Coast of Texas.\n\nThat would appear to give cover to President Barack Obama, who said last summer that he would approve the pipeline if it did not “significantly exacerbate” greenhouse gas emissions, according to The New York Times. The State Department and Obama must approve construction of the pipeline because it crosses an international border.\n\nSome environmental activists question the report’s validity, saying that the contractor hired to prepare an earlier draft of it has ties to TransCanada, the company hoping to build the pipeline. The State Department’s inspector general investigated ERM Group’s financial links to TransCanada, according to The Washington Post. But the IG refused to release its findings on that matter.\n\nThe State Department had asked TransCanada to provide names of consultants with whom the company had not worked or worked only in a limited capacity, according to a report by BuzzFeed. One of the companies named was ERM. It was later reported in Mother Jones magazine that ERM’s second-in-command on the project, Andrew Bielakowski, had previously worked for TransCanada on three pipeline projects.\n\n“In what could be perceived as eagerness to please the oil industry and Canadian government, the State Department is issuing this report amidst an ongoing investigation into conflicts of interest, and lying, by its contractor,” said Erich Pica, president of the Friends of the Earth environmental group. “It is unacceptable that the oil industry and a foreign government are better informed than the American Congress and its citizenry.”\n\nThe report did say that the pipeline proposed would be “likely to adversely affect the American burying beetle.” Last year, an Interior Department letter said the draft report didn’t take into account long-term effects to wildlife.\n\n“The question going into the State Department’s final environmental impact statement is this: Who will State listen to?” Jim Murphy, senior counsel at the National Wildlife Federation, said in a statement. “Will State reverse course after listening to the Environmental Protection Agency experts who criticized the first draft as ‘inadequate’ and the second draft as ‘insufficient’ on climate impacts, oil spill risks, and threats to water resources?”\n\nThe report said the tar sands oil fields in Canada would continue to be developed if the pipeline is not built. In that case, oil would be shipped to Texas via rail, which would cause more greenhouse gas emissions than shipping via pipeline.\n\nPipeline proponents say the construction and operation of the line will create jobs. However, some studies indicate that only 3,900 to 20,000 short-term jobs would be created during construction, and about 35 permanent jobs would be created to operate the line.\n\nA White House spokesman said no decision would be made on the construction until various federal agencies and the public had had a chance to comment on the pipeline.\n\nNew Documents Raise Questions About Keystone Environmental Study (by Evan McMorris-Santoro, BuzzFeed)\n\nInterior Dept.

How ‘bout some spicy quotes:\n\n• “If the speaker proposes something that says, right away, folks aren't being deported, families aren't being separated, we're able to attract top young students to provide the skills or start businesses here and then there's a regular process of citizenship, I'm not sure how wide the divide ends up being.” — President Barack Obama\n\nabout the possibility of a breakthrough on immigration.\n\nWhat Obama would give up in the ongoing negotiations is a new pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, something he has said he wants. It goes without saying that the president badly needs a victory on something — anything — right now to give his second term a reason for being.\n\n• “Obamacare is on borrowed time.” — House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Republican from Virginia, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\nCantor said the need for an alternative will grow as more people sign up for coverage and are, in his words, negatively affected. He promised that House Republicans will offer an alternative this year.\n\n• “The fact that our Senate is moving first on [the bill] this year may be an indication that we might move this year. If the Senate is successful, it will move in the House.” — Missouri House Speaker Tim Jones\n\nabout the likelihood of new voter identification laws in the state.\n\nGOP are feeling pretty good about the prospects of passing a new law — a constitutional amendment — this year. The Senate has proven to be the obstacle in recent years. Republicans say they’ve addressed concerns the state Supreme Court has had. Democrats, including Secretary of State Jason Kander, the state’s chief elections officer, insist the measure is unconstitutional. Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, has yet to weigh in. If it passes, Missouri would become one of five other states with strict voter ID laws.\n\n• “Enough stalling. More American energy means more American jobs – and this shovel-ready project would create tens of thousands of American jobs at no cost to taxpayers. President Obama needs to use his pen to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline now.” — Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican.\n\nA report out Friday said the project would not substantially worsen carbon pollution. The New York Times concluded that the report now leaves an opening for the president to approve what has been an intensely controversial project for years now. The White House response: “He’ll deliberate and take the time he needs,” a spokeswoman said. Environmentalists, who helped elect the president, will flip if Obama signs off on this deal.",

            "text": "Setting the stage for a contentious home stretch on one of the most polarizing issues in the Obama presidency, the State Department on Friday released its final environmental impact statement for the Keystone XL pipeline. It concluded that “approval or denial of…the proposed Project is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands.”\n\nFirst proposed by Calgary-based TransCanada in 2008, the $7 billion, 875-mile pipeline would carry up to 830,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Alberta’s tar sand reserves to a vast oil depot in Oklahoma, and eventually to refineries near Houston.\n\nThe release of the report, called the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Keystone XL Project, triggers a 90-day review period in which the State Department—which has jurisdiction over such cross-border projects—must study whether building Keystone XL would be “in the U.S. national interest.” The ultimate decision lies with President Obama, who told an audience at Georgetown University in June that he wouldn't approve the pipeline if it would \"significantly exacerbate” the problem of carbon emissions.\n\nThat’s become the crux of the issue ever since: Will the EIS find that building the pipeline will lead to expanded production of oil in the tar sands region of Northern Alberta, and hence increased emissions, such as it would be “game over for the climate,” as NASA climatologist James Hansen has famously warned? TransCanada Corp. wouldn’t be spending $7 billion and putting up with this multiyear process if it wasn’t sure it could fill Keystone XL for decades to come while charging for the privilege.\n\nThe final EIS, like the draft version released last March, finds that the oil would find its way out of Canada whether or not Keystone XL was built. But that’s debatable. Tar sands oil and shale oil are currently moving south via rail at such a rate that last year was the worst ever for accidents involving trains hauling oil, with dozens killed. This transportation method is likely to face opposition and increased regulation. The only other planned pipeline would head west, through territory controlled by Canada’s First People, who enjoy a great deal of sovereignty over tar sands oil because of the health and habitat damages experienced in the region where it’s mined. Even Canada's minister of natural resources, Joe Oliver, told the Financial Times last year that to get the oil out of Canada, “if we can’t build the infrastructure then the resources are stranded.”\n\nMainstream news outlets such as The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times report that the State Department has again concluded that Keystone XL’s climate effects would be negligible, with The New York Times concluding that it appears “to indicate that the project has passed Mr. Obama’s climate criteria.”\n\nStill, environmentalists found enough in the report to rally—and lobby—around. The National Resources Defense Council said in a statement that the State Department “has, for the first time, acknowledged that the proposed project could accelerate climate change.” Retiring California Rep. Henry Waxman, one of the green movement’s fiercest advocates on Capitol Hill, added that \"while still flawed, this environmental review recognizes that the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline could have a significant effect on carbon pollution.\"\n\nPipeline proponents, including the Canadian government and most Republicans in Congress, say it would reduce dependence on foreign oil and increase jobs. But the actual number of jobs would be minimal. \"Once the proposed project enters service, operations would require approximately 50 total employees in the United States: 35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors,” according to the new EIS. Outside analysis found that the counterintuitive boost in gas prices that would result in the Midwest if the pipeline got built (thus ending a glut at the Oklahoma depot) would destroy jobs.\n\nGreen groups have accused the State Department of relying on consultants with prior business ties to TransCanada. This, in turn, prompted the department’s inspector general to start an investigation, which is pending.\n\n“In what could be perceived as eagerness to please the oil industry and Canadian government, the State Department is issuing this report amidst an ongoing investigation into conflicts of interest, and lying, by its contractor,” Erich Pica, the president of Friends of the Earth, wrote in an email. “By letting the oil industry influence this process, Secretary Kerry is undermining his long-established reputation as a leader in the fight against climate change.”\n\nWhile the clock ticks on Obama's decision, expect him to face an avalanche of lobbying from both sides.",

released a muchawaited assessment of the keystone xl pipelines environmental impacts which concluded that pipeline construction remains unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands effectively turning a blind eye to the staggering carbon emissions from tar sands extraction and expansion plans while mr obamas warm embrace of fossil fuels surprised some environmentalists it should come as little surprise in light of prior comments made by the ceo of the american petroleum institute api its our expectation it will be released next week jack gerard confidently told reuters referring to the keystone xl assessment while many were still speculating that the report might not be issued until after the november midterm election were expecting to hear the same conclusion that weve heard four times before no significant impact on the environment mr gerard added that these predictions were based on sources within the administration in fact as the keystone decisionmaking process has unfolded the oil and gas industry has had — as theyve enjoyed for decades — intensive access to decisionmaking in the white house this access has helped form the obama administrations schizophrenic energy policy in which the president backs both renewable energy and fossil fuels without acknowledging that the two are competitors when fossil fuels gain market share renewables lose while even the world bank has called for immediate action on climate change the api which has worked hard to shape obamas views on fossil fuels has also worked to create doubt around the very concept of fossilfueldriven climate change and to downplay the impact their industry has had theres no question that the oil and gas industry wields enormous sway inside washington dc the api has spent 93 million dollars this year alone on reportable lobbying expenses the highest amount in the groups history according to data from opensecretsorg this summer a desmog investigation found that api spent 2203 million dollars lobbying at the federal level on keystone xl andor tar sands issues since june 2008 when the pipeline project was first proposed the api has also worked hard to convince lawmakers that voters overwhelmingly back the pipeline despite a groundswell of grassroots organizing that has led to the projects declining popularity this summer mr gerards group launched a massive ad campaign — featuring former presidents george w bush and bill clinton — that was timed to be seen by lawmakers in washington dc and when they headed back to their home states for recess api has also funded astroturf campaigns exposed by leaked documents cited questionable job creation numbers and drawn fire from media watchdogs for playing fast and loose with the facts the industrys

something especially odd the biographies of each expert had been redacted suggesting that the state department may have known of those potential conflicts and attempted to hide that fact the state departments inspector general promised to investigate the conflict of interest allegations but the results of those investigations are still not public the api has tended to strongly favor republicans over democrats in its campaign contributions but over the past several years the obama administration has reached out to the oil and gas industry group soliciting its views nonetheless mr gerard remained unsatisfied at least theyre listening he told oil and gas journal in 2012 but theyre not following every one of our recommendations if this past week is any indication that might be starting to shift after obamas state of the union address mr gerard was quick to applaud the presidents description of natural gas — which emits a little more than half as much carbon dioxide when burned as coal but whose total climate impacts could actually be worse than coal once methane emissions are tallied — saying that the president was evolving this year he gave a fullthroated endorsement to natural gas mr gerard told the wall street journal next year hell be giving a fullthroated endorsement to us oil production his words are going in the right direction for us mr gerard added the api has emerged as a significant influence over the obama administration and its inherently flawed alloftheabove vision for our energy future the reason keystone xl matters so much is not just as its symbolic importance as the fact that it would reflect a major longterm commitment to continued fossil fuel extraction — at a moment when climate experts are saying we must take immediate and drastic action and leave twothirds of known fossil reserves in the ground in his state of the union mr obama talked up benefits of oil and gas and then gave mention to renewables like wind and solar but he showed no awareness that a longterm commitment to fossil fuels is in direct tension with furthering renewable energy if we are truly serious about fighting the climate crisis we must look beyond an all of the above energy policy and replace dirty fuels with clean energy the sierra clubs michael brune said we cant effectively act on climate and expand drilling and fracking for oil and gas at the same time for its part the api s stance on climate has long been one of obfuscation a 1998 api communications action plan reads victory will be achieved when citizens understand uncertainties in climate science and recognition of uncertainties becomes part of the conventional wisdom jack gerard has argued that fracking represents a benefit for the environment citing the fact that carbon emissions have dropped since the shale boom began not only does this ignore the role that the recession has played in reducing energy consumption but it also ignores the effects of another key greenhouse gas methane there is strong evidence that methane emissions from the oil and gas industry could make natural gas even worse than burning coal in terms of its overall climate impact and there are signs that the reductions cited by mr gerard are already over earlier this month the eia announced that co 2 emissions rose 2 percent in 2013 reversing earlier declines of course if keystone xl is ultimately approved carbon emissions can be expected to spike the pipeline will carry up to 830000 barrels of tar sands oil per day opening keystone would emit as much co 2 into the atmosphere

good morning its a winter saturday a good day to stay in a comfy bed for awhile relax and catch up on the latest news so lets see whats happening out there today first up the allimportant weather forecast i know you wont be surprised to learn there are more winter storms on the way from the weather channel winter storm maximus brings snow ice to midwest south east rockies through monday winter storm maximus the 13th named storm of the winter season in the us will have deposited a wintry mess from coast to coast by the time it is finally over monday this storm will have multiple waves of snow sleet and freezing rain sweeping west to east across the country first snow will taper off over parts of the southern and central rockies a few additional inches of snow are expected over the mountains of colorado and northern new mexico this storm will drop snow in the west parts of the south and midwest and then move into upstate new york and northern new england its not yet clear what well be getting in the northeast but right now we are expecting a warm weekend and the storm shouldnt interfere with the super bowl tomorrow another wave of wintry precipitation kicks off early sunday in the southern plains spreading to the ozarks and the midsouth region sunday afternoon then sweeping quickly through the tennessee valley appalachians and east sunday night and monday snow accumulations look most likely in a stripe from northwest texas into parts of oklahoma northern arkansas tennessee kentucky west virgina and virginia with several inches of accumulation possible parts of northwest texas and southern oklahoma near the red river could measure up to around six inches of snow maximus will be closely followed by winter storm nika which will bring widespread snow and ice to the plains the great lakes and the northeast tomorrow is ground hog day but whether or not the sleepy rodent sees his shadow it looks like winter is going to continue unabated in georgia where people are still trying to recover from their state governments failure to prepare for a winter storm that had been predicted for two days beforehand investigators are still trying assign blame for the massive fckup from the atlanta journalcontitution storm debacle case study of emergency management failure after two inches of snow turned georgia into a national punch line the states top

tuesday is a case study in how things can go badly said irwin redlener director of the national center for disaster preparedness at columbia university its also a case study in what can happen if you keep electing republicans who hate government and dont believe it has a role in public problemsolving according to the article gov nathan deal and other government officials had plenty of warning that the storm was going to hit atlanta yet they did next to nothing to prepare read all the gory details at the link at the national memo joe conason provides an example of how government has worked well in two bloodred states universal prek ask republicans in georgia and oklahoma — and then ask grover norquist among the biggest policy mistakes of the past 50 years is our continuing failure to provide quality early childhood education to all of americas kids for children families and society as a whole the benefits of universal prek are not only significant and well documented but offset the financial cost many times over although weve been aware of these basic facts since the early sixties most politicians have preferred to squander billions of dollars on malfunctioning weaponry catastrophic wars and petroleum subsidies even if there were no economic upside to starting the education of every child at three or four years of age the obvious social benefits would vital for any country that aspires to cultivating a vibrant democratic republic citizens who can read and do math and perhaps take an interest in science are more likely to succeed at selfgovernment they are also far more likely to succeed in life enhancing personal opportunity is how universal preschool generates universal public savings — estimated by a large cohort of studies to lie somewhere between 7 and 17 dollars for every single dollar spent human brains mostly develop well before age five so children who attend quality preschool enter kindergarten with social skills confidence and knowledge that boosts achievement for many years so what happened in georgia and oklahoma in oklahoma where every child has been entitled to free preschool since 1998 a wellknown study by georgetown university educators found substantially improved cognitive skills and test scores among tulsa students who had attended public prek the program made the difference between falling below national norms and moving up to achieve them in georgia first to implement universal statefunded preschool almost 20 years ago painstaking research has likewise showed gains in math and reading that lasted through eighth grade especially among underprivileged rural and urban children what about grover norquist according to conason he sends his own kids to dcs free public preschool program despise his avowed opposition to taxes of any kind maybe some of those right wing congresspeople should have a talk with him about early childhood education its looking more and more like the keystone xl pipeline will be approved according to the nyt the state department released a report on friday concluding that the keystone xl pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution leaving an opening for president obama to approve the politically divisive project the departments longawaited environmental impact statement appears to indicate that the project could pass the criteria mr obama set forth in a speech last summer when he said he would approve the 1700mile pipeline if it would not significantly exacerbate the problem of greenhouse gas emissions although the pipeline would carry 830000 barrels of oil a day from canada to the gulf coast the report appears to indicate that if it were not built carbonheavy oil would still be extracted at the same rate from pristine alberta forest and transported to refineries by rail instead the report sets up a difficult decision for secretary of state john kerry who now must make a recommendation on the international project to mr obama mr kerry who hopes to make action on climate change a key part of his legacy has never publicly offered his personal views on the pipeline aides said mr kerry was preparing to dive into the 11volume report and would give high priority to the issue of global warming in making the decision his aides offered no timetable if so there will be pushback from indigenous americans keystone xl black snake pipeline to face epic opposition from native american alliance a native american alliance is forming to block construction of transcanadas proposed keystone xl pipeline which still needs final approval from us president barack obama after the state department released an environmental report indicating the project wouldnt have a significant impact alberta tar sands production members from the seven tribes of the lakota nation along with tribal members and tribes in idaho oklahoma montana nebraska and oregon have been preparing to stop construction of the 1400 kilometre pipeline which is slated to run on the us side from morgan mon to steel city neb and pump 830000 barrels per day from albertas tar sands the pipeline would originate in hardisty alta it poses a threat to our sacred water and the product is coming from the tar sands and our tribes oppose the tar sands mining said deborah white plume of the oglala sioux tribe which is part of the lakota nation in south dakota all of our tribes have taken action to oppose the keystone xl pipeline read the rest at the link the economist has an interesting article about the winter olympic games and vladimir putins russia sochi or bust the conspicuous dazzle of the games masks a country and a president in deepening trouble february 7th sees the opening of the winter olympics in sochi on the black sea the message of the games is simple russia is back sochi was planned as a celebration of russias resurgence a symbol of international recognition and a crowning moment for vladimir putin its president who for the present seems to have seen off all his challengers appropriately the opening ceremony will include the image of the russian troikabird from nikolai gogols dead souls rus wrote gogol arent you soaring like a spry troika that cant be overtaken the road is smoking under you the bridges thunder everything steps aside and is left behindis this lightning thrown down from heaven other nations and states gaze askance step off the road and give you right of way the quote has long been used to justify russian exceptionalism and moral superiority gogol describes russia as a deeply flawed and corrupt country but it is precisely its misery and sinfulness that entitles it to mystical regeneration his troika carries a swindler chichikov and his drunken coachman but it is transformed into the symbol of a godinspired country that gloriously surpasses all others so too with the sochi olympics this grand enterprise the largest construction project in russias postsoviet history is also a microcosm of russian corruption inefficiencies excesses of wealth and disregard for ordinary citizens the olympics are widely seen as an extravagant caprice of russias rulers especially its flamboyantly macho president rather than a common national effort the cost of the games has more than quadrupled since 2007 making them at 50 billion the most expensive in history one member of the international olympic committee thinks about a third of that money has been stolen russias opposition leaders say the figure is much higher check it out its a long read but worthwhile imo theres some good news out of new york city now that neofacist mayor mike bloomberg is gone it looks like the stop and frisk policy will end soon mayor says new york city will settle suits on stopandfrisk tactics new york city will settle its longrunning legal battle over the police departments practice of stopping questioning and often frisking people on the street — a divisive issue at the heart of the mayoral race last year — by agreeing to reforms that a judge ordered in august mayor bill de blasio announced on thursday in making the announcement which he said he hoped would end a turbulent chapter in the citys racial history mr de blasio offered a sweeping repudiation of the aggressive policing practices that had been a hallmark of his predecessor michael r bloomberg but that had stoked anger and resentment in many black and latino neighborhoods he essentially reversed the course set by mr bloomberg whose administration had appealed the judges ruling were here today to turn the page on one of the most divisive problems in our city mr de blasio said at a news conference we believe in ending the overuse of stopandfrisk that has unfairly targeted young africanamerican and latino men thats great news

experience to deal with it it can be a disaster as we are seeing right now in atlanta as i said in the comment thread yesterday i think the only good solution is to shut down the city and keep cars off the streets for a few days thats what massachusetts governor michael dukakis did here after the blizzard of 78 he declared a state of emergency got businesses to shut down for a week and ordered everyone to stay off the roads except for emergency and government vehicles then dukakis appeared on tv everyday updating the public on the crisis and explaining what he and officials were doing to

dozen deaths from traffic accidents and a mobile home fire yet it was atlanta home to major corporations and the worlds busiest airport that was exhibit a for how a southern city could be sent reeling by winter weather that in the north might be no more than an inconvenience instead of showing leadership georgia governor nathan deal just let it happen and then whined about the weather forecasters and the media at that time it was still in most of the forecasts anticipated that the city of atlanta would only have a mild dusting or a very small accumulation if any deal said at a wednesday press conference preparations were made for those predictions forecasters erupted following the comments the national weather service argued that the appropriate outlooks watches and warnings were released two days in advance i would have acted sooner and i think we learn from that and then we will act sooner the next time deal told reporters but we dont want to be accused of crying wolf because if we had been wrong yall would have all been in here saying do you know how many millions of dollars you cost the economies of the city of atlanta and the state of georgia by shutting down businesses all over this city and this state hey thats the way it goes you prepare for the worst and if the predictions are wrong you still took precautions and thousands of kids dont get stuck on the roads and in their schools thats what massachusetts officials learned after the 78 blizzard that wasnt predicted either and we ended up getting more than 20 inches of snow that landed on top of a previous snowfall of more than a foot it was a disaster and nowadays we prepare for the worst and just give a sigh of relief the worst doesnt happen if you dont want to show real leadership dont run for governor the problem with republicans is that they dont really believe in government so they sit on their hands when disaster strikes in other news italy is trying amanda knox for the third time –apparently over

the italian town of perugia with kercher then 21 who was found partially naked in a pool of blood with her throat slashed surely president obama wont allow knox to be extradited to italy i sure hope not knox has refused to attend the second appeal which opened in florence last year writing to the court from seattle that she fears being wrongly convicted in an interview with italian television wednesday knox said she would be waiting at home with her family for the verdict with my heart in my mouth the proof is in the facts there is no proof i was there when it happened she said i really dont understand why this is happening things are really getting out of control in the ukraine–and thats an understatement some updates bbc news ukraine protesters defy terms of new amnesty law

that thousands of officials can nominate anyone they want for the nobel peace prize he fully expects to be pilloried for it by the snowdengreenwald cult if you have a paper thin skin as i do and are paid to comment on the news this for some mysterious reason also applies to me its advisable to fully disengage from writing about the edward snowden saga after the initial leaks i offered a cautious piece urging against the instant beatification of the former nsa contractor we knew little about him i argued so lets wait for it to play out and well be better situated to determine if he was more pentagon papers than pumpkin papers but its one of those stories allergic to nuance youre either a lackey of empire the snowden skeptic or a fulminating antiamerican trying to undermine obamas foreign policy the snowden supporter in a debate without shades of grey id rather leave the whole business to those with more anger passion and energy but allow me to wade into one tiny aspect of the snowden affair without wading into the debate across twitter and cluttering my inbox in stories from time bloomberg the verge the guardian the washington post reuters and dozens of others and in breathless dispatches from the universe of facebook i have been repeatedly informed within that last twentyfour hours that edward snowden has been nominated for a nobel peace prize take that previous nobel peace prize laureate barack obama well almost because all of the media outlets listed above and all my snowdenite friends on facebook and twitter have fallen for the perennial person whose politics i share was nominated for the most meaningless prize on the planet story but what dear reader does it actually mean to be nominated for a nobel peace prize the short answer not much i hope youll read the rest

truly are the undereducated childlike impressionable irrational dangerous cog in americas political system that puts democracy most at risk in her book papantonio explained jacobs found that more than 40 percent of americans under the age of 44 did not read a single book over the course of the previous year and their concentration had deteriorated to the point that politicians needed to condense their messages into 8second soundbytes to grab their attention leading her to conclude that the country was now ill with a powerful mutant strain of intertwined ignorance antirationalism and antiintellectualism compounded by schools increased emphasis on passing standardized tests instead of comprehensive education on subjects like civics and humanities if the susan jacobys are right and antiintellectualism is a trend in america then spoonfeeding our children with facts and figures designed merely to pass a standardized test will never prepare them to preserve democracy papantonio

            "text": "It’s a winter Saturday, a good day to stay in a comfy bed for awhile, relax, and catch up on the latest news. So let’s see what’s happening out there today.\n\nFirst up, the all-important weather forecast. I know you won’t be surprised to learn there are more winter storms on the way. From the Weather Channel: Winter Storm Maximus Brings Snow, Ice to Midwest, South, East, Rockies Through Monday.\n\nWinter Storm Maximus, the 13th named storm of the winter season in the U.S., will have deposited a wintry mess from coast to coast by the time it is finally over Monday. This storm will have multiple waves of snow, sleet and freezing rain sweeping west to east across the country. First, snow will taper off over parts of the southern and central Rockies. A few additional inches of snow are expected over the mountains of Colorado and northern New Mexico. This storm will drop snow in the west, parts of the South and Midwest and then move into upstate New York and Northern New England. It’s not yet clear what we’ll be getting in the northeast, but right now we are expecting a warm weekend, and the storm shouldn’t interfere with the Super Bowl tomorrow. another wave of wintry precipitation kicks off early Sunday in the Southern Plains, spreading to the Ozarks and the Mid-South region Sunday afternoon, then sweeping quickly through the Tennessee Valley, Appalachians and East Sunday night and Monday. Snow accumulations look most likely in a stripe from northwest Texas into parts of Oklahoma, northern Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virgina, and Virginia with several inches of accumulation possible. Parts of northwest Texas and southern Oklahoma near the Red River could measure up to around six inches of snow.\n\n“Maximus” will be closely followed by Winter Storm Nika, which will bring “widespread” snow and ice to the Plains, the Great Lakes, and the Northeast. Tomorrow is Ground Hog Day, but whether or not the sleepy rodent sees his shadow, it looks like winter is going to continue unabated.\n\nIn Georgia, where people are still trying to recover from their state government’s failure to prepare for a winter storm that had been predicted for two days beforehand, investigators are still trying assign blame for the massive f&ck-up.\n\nFrom the Atlanta Journal-Contitution: Storm debacle ‘case study’ of emergency management failure.\n\nIt’s also a case study in what can happen if you keep electing Republicans who hate government and don’t believe it has a role in public problem-solving. According to the article, Gov. Nathan Deal and other government officials had plenty of warning that the storm was going to hit Atlanta, yet they did next to nothing to prepare. Read all the gory details at the link.\n\nAt The National Memo, Joe Conason provides an example of how government has worked well in two blood-red states: Universal Pre-K? Ask Republicans In Georgia And Oklahoma — And Then Ask Grover Norquist.\n\nAmong the biggest policy mistakes of the past 50 years is our continuing failure to provide quality early childhood education to all of America’s kids. For children, families, and society as a whole, the benefits of “universal pre-K” are not only significant and well documented, but offset the financial cost many times over. Although we’ve been aware of these basic facts since the early Sixties, most politicians have preferred to squander billions of dollars on malfunctioning weaponry, catastrophic wars, and petroleum subsidies…. Even if there were no economic upside to starting the education of every child at three or four years of age, the obvious social benefits would vital for any country that aspires to cultivating a vibrant democratic republic. Citizens who can read and do math (and perhaps take an interest in science!) are more likely to succeed at self-government. They are also far more likely to succeed in life. Enhancing personal opportunity is how universal pre-school generates universal public savings — estimated by a large cohort of studies to lie somewhere between 7 and 17 dollars for every single dollar spent.  Human brains mostly develop well before age five, so children who attend quality pre-school enter kindergarten with social skills, confidence, and knowledge that boosts achievement for many years.\n\nSo what happened in Georgia and Oklahoma?\n\nWhat about Grover Norquist? According to Conason he sends his own kids to D.C.’s free public pre-school program, despise his avowed opposition to taxes of any kind. Maybe some of those right wing Congresspeople should have a talk with him about early childhood education.\n\nIt’s looking more and more like the Keystone XL Pipeline will be approved, according to the NYT:\n\nThe State Department released a report on Friday concluding that the Keystone XL pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution, leaving an opening for President Obama to approve the politically divisive project. The department’s long-awaited environmental impact statement appears to indicate that the project could pass the criteria Mr. Obama set forth in a speech last summer when he said he would approve the 1,700-mile pipeline if it would not “significantly exacerbate” the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Although the pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada to the Gulf Coast, the report appears to indicate that if it were not built, carbon-heavy oil would still be extracted at the same rate from pristine Alberta forest and transported to refineries by rail instead. The report sets up a difficult decision for Secretary of State John Kerry, who now must make a recommendation on the international project to Mr. Obama. Mr. Kerry, who hopes to make action on climate change a key part of his legacy, has never publicly offered his personal views on the pipeline. Aides said Mr. Kerry was preparing to “dive into” the 11-volume report and would give high priority to the issue of global warming in making the decision. His aides offered no timetable.\n\nIf so, there will be pushback from indigenous Americans: Keystone XL ‘black snake’ pipeline to face ‘epic’ opposition from Native American alliance.\n\nA Native American alliance is forming to block construction of TransCanada’s proposed Keystone XL pipeline which still needs final approval from U.S. President Barack Obama after the State Department released an environmental report indicating the project wouldn’t have a significant impact Alberta tar sands production. Members from the seven tribes of the Lakota Nation, along with tribal members and tribes in Idaho, Oklahoma, Montana, Nebraska and Oregon, have been preparing to stop construction of the 1,400 kilometre pipeline which is slated to run, on the U.S. side, from Morgan, Mon., to Steel City, Neb., and pump 830,000 barrels per day from Alberta’s tar sands. The pipeline would originate in Hardisty, Alta. “It poses a threat to our sacred water and the product is coming from the tar sands and our tribes oppose the tar sands mining,” said Deborah White Plume, of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, which is part of the Lakota Nation in South Dakota. “All of our tribes have taken action to oppose the Keystone XL pipeline.”\n\nRead the rest at the link.\n\nThe Economist has an interesting article about the Winter Olympic games and Vladimir Putin’s Russia: Sochi or bust: The conspicuous dazzle of the games masks a country, and a president, in deepening trouble\n\nFEBRUARY 7th sees the opening of the winter Olympics in Sochi on the Black Sea. The message of the games is simple: “Russia is back”. Sochi was planned as a celebration of Russia’s resurgence, a symbol of international recognition and a crowning moment for Vladimir Putin, its president, who for the present seems to have seen off all his challengers. Appropriately, the opening ceremony will include the image of the Russian “troika-bird” from Nikolai Gogol’s “Dead Souls”. “Rus,” wrote Gogol, “aren’t you soaring like a spry troika that can’t be overtaken? The road is smoking under you, the bridges thunder, everything steps aside and is left behind!…Is this lightning thrown down from heaven? Other nations and states gaze askance, step off the road and give [you] right of way.” The quote has long been used to justify Russian exceptionalism and moral superiority. Gogol describes Russia as a deeply flawed and corrupt country, but it is precisely its misery and sinfulness that entitles it to mystical regeneration. His troika carries a swindler, Chichikov, and his drunken coachman, but it is transformed into the symbol of a God-inspired country that gloriously surpasses all others. So, too, with the Sochi Olympics. This grand enterprise, the largest construction project in Russia’s post-Soviet history, is also a microcosm of Russian corruption, inefficiencies, excesses of wealth and disregard for ordinary citizens. The Olympics are widely seen as an extravagant caprice of Russia’s rulers, especially its flamboyantly macho president, rather than a common national effort. The cost of the games has more than quadrupled since 2007, making them, at $50 billion, the most expensive in history. One member of the International Olympic Committee thinks about a third of that money has been stolen. Russia’s opposition leaders say the figure is much higher.\n\nCheck it out. It’s a long read, but worthwhile, IMO.\n\nThere’s some good news out of New York City, now that neo-facist Mayor Mike Bloomberg is gone. It looks like the “stop and frisk” policy will end soon: Mayor Says New York City Will Settle Suits on Stop-and-Frisk Tactics.\n\nNew York City will settle its long-running legal battle over the Police Department’s practice of stopping, questioning and often frisking people on the street — a divisive issue at the heart of the mayoral race last year — by agreeing to reforms that a judge ordered in August, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Thursday. In making the announcement, which he said he hoped would end a turbulent chapter in the city’s racial history, Mr. de Blasio offered a sweeping repudiation of the aggressive policing practices that had been a hallmark of his predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, but that had stoked anger and resentment in many black and Latino neighborhoods. He essentially reversed the course set by Mr. Bloomberg, whose administration had appealed the judge’s ruling. “We’re here today to turn the page on one of the most divisive problems in our city,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference. “We believe in ending the overuse of stop-and-frisk that has unfairly targeted young African-American and Latino men.”\n\nThat’s great news, but I wish he had noted that women have also been targeted, often in sexually abusive ways.\n\nI’ll wrap this up and put my remaining links in the comment thread. I hope you’ll do the same. Please let us know what stories you’ve found interesting today.",

            "text": "Each week in Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. Thomas Mallon and Dana Stevens discuss the difficulties of conveying what writers do on film.\n\nBecause no one wants to watch somebody typing, Hollywood often makes movies about writers who stop writing.\n\nEarly in “Limitless” (2011), moviegoers see Bradley Cooper leaning over a keyboard, hands pressed prayerfully to face, waiting in agony for the words. Salvation arrives in the form of a pill that allows Cooper’s character, the writer Eddie Morra, to use 100 percent of his brain instead of just 20. The words start coming, clear and fast and shiny; indeed, Eddie becomes so lucid that he gives up authorship for day-trading.\n\nBecause no one wants to watch somebody typing, Hollywood often makes movies about writers who stop writing. It’s easier, and more entertaining, to show them being Technicolorfully destroyed by fame or drink or premature success. We’ve had two Capote movies in the last decade, and back in 1959, “Beloved Infidel” gave viewers a soap-operatic couple of hours with the declining F. Scott Fitzgerald. Played by Gregory Peck, who looks as if he drinks wheatgrass and runs five miles a day, the alcoholic Fitzgerald struggles to reconnect with his own muse after failing at the schlocky collaborations of screenwriting: “You write beautiful prose, Scott, but we can’t photograph adjectives,” says the movie executive who fires him.\n\nOn film, authorship is mostly a matter of occupational hazard. Woody Allen’s “Deconstructing Harry” (1997) offers a Fellini-like look at a novelist who writes from his own life, infuriating lovers and family members: “You take everyone’s suffering and turn it into gold, literary gold,” complains one girlfriend. “Wonder Boys” (2000), made from Michael Chabon’s novel, combines New York trade publishing (Robert Downey Jr. as a burnt-out editor) with the provincial world of M.F.A. workshops (Michael Douglas as a weed-smoking teacher who’s gone seven years between books). In the course of a campus literary festival, amid much comic calamity, the two men rejuvenate themselves by giving the spooky acolyte Tobey Maguire a Dionysian push.\n\nThe hard part is always trying to show writers doing what they actually do. The Michael Douglas character occasionally sits at his Selectric wearing a woman’s bathrobe, like a pitcher’s lucky underwear, trying to summon more phrases for his already overlong, inert manuscript. As Lillian Hellman in “Julia” (1977), Jane Fonda flings her typewriter (oh, if only!) out the window; and in “The Hours” (2002), a nasally extended Nicole Kidman renders Virginia Woolf’s creative process by chewing on a pen, lighting a cigarette, knitting a brow. “Leonard,” she is able to say. “I believe I have my first sentence.” Her pen scratches words to which a voice-over gives life support, since even in extreme close-up, filmed prose cannot be relied upon to “pop.”\n\nMartin Amis once observed that “a writer is, on the whole, most alive when alone.” That’s when he gets “on with the business of imagining other people.” And that’s why movies do a much better job of admiring authorship than conveying it. All those nail-nibbling qwerty moments give no sense of the tumult of memory and association and arrangement taking place behind the writer’s eyes. Most of that has gone on long before the computer got booted up this morning, during endless odd hours when the writer may have been shoveling the snow or paying bills. (I myself have come to realize that the reason I can’t remember much about many of the movies I’ve seen is that, while watching them in the quiet dark, I’m thinking about what to do next with the manuscript upstairs on my desk.)\n\nPerhaps the best method the movies could use for showing writers at work is one employed by a handful of films like “Lady in the Lake” (1947), in which the main character provides, literally, the point of view — not so much a face the audience sees as the eyes through which it sees. As things stand, the most fundamental problem with writer-movies is the built-in redundancy, something captured by Christopher Isherwood’s concise bit of authorial self-definition: “I am a camera.”\n\nThomas Mallon’s eight novels include “Henry and Clara,” “Bandbox,” “Fellow Travelers” and “Watergate,” a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award. He has also published nonfiction about plagiarism (“Stolen Words”), diaries (“A Book of One’s Own”), letters (“Yours Ever”) and the Kennedy assassination (“Mrs. Paine’s Garage”), as well as two books of essays (“Rockets and Rodeos” and “In Fact”). His work appears in The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly and other publications. He received his Ph.D. in English and American Literature from Harvard University and taught for a number of years at Vassar College. His honors include Guggenheim and Rockefeller fellowships, the National Book Critics Circle citation for reviewing, and the Vursell prize of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, for distinguished prose style. He has been literary editor of Gentlemen’s Quarterly and deputy chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and in 2012 was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is currently professor of English at George Washington University.\n\n“Barton Fink” shows a wicked, earthbound honesty about the sinkhole of authorial self-obsession.\n\nThere’s a story I love about the production history of the Coen brothers’ 1991 comedy “Barton Fink”: Its screenplay was written over a three-week period while the brothers took a break from their struggles with the script for “Miller’s Crossing.” Although the Coens themselves have resisted journalistic efforts to frame this project-within-a-project as a case of “writer’s block” — and indeed, we should all be so lucky as to have dry spells that so quickly result in a Palme d’Or-winning movie — there remains something hilariously apt about the origin story of this cruelest of films about being a writer.\n\nMovies about authorship run the nearly unavoidable risk of flattering both their own authors and the subjects they depict. After all, someone had to create the script ex nihilo, sitting in front of a blank screen (or, in the case of the luckless Barton, a blank piece of paper rolled into an Underwood typewriter in a dingy, oozy-wallpapered Los Angeles hotel room that is seemingly alive). Anyone who’s making a movie about writing in the first place presumably values the written word enough to be invested in the significance of the improbable act of transforming the chaos of existence into orderly lines of words. Hence the by-now-familiar heroic writing montage: the furrowed squint, the crumpled pages piling up in and around the wastebasket, the close-up of letters accumulating on the page as the keyboard finally begins its triumphant clicketyclack.\n\n“Barton Fink” references all these clichés while falling victim to none of them. Its hero, played by John Turturro, is a Jewish New York intellectual brimful of condescending lefty ideas about “the common man.” (Fink is based on the playwright Clifford Odets about as loosely as the protagonist of the Coens’ recent “Inside Llewyn Davis” was modeled after the folk singer Dave Van Ronk.) Buoyed by the critical raves for his first Broadway play, a dreadful-sounding proletarian drama with the portentous Shakespearean title “Bare Ruined Choirs,” Fink accepts an offer that turns out to be, perhaps literally, a devil’s bargain: a thousand dollars a week (in 1941 dollars!) to relocate to Hollywood and write the script for a B-grade wrestling picture.\n\nOnce he’s ensconced in that ominous room at the Hotel Earle and charged by an inexplicably fawning studio exec with the task of churning out a script that will deliver “that Barton Fink feeling,” Barton embarks on a process so many writers experience, in miniature, every time we’re on deadline. The obdurate, set-in-stone first paragraph that will yield no further wisdom no matter how long we stare at it (and that, if we had the perspective our readers do, we would realize sounds suspiciously like the last opening we wrote). The importuning neighbor (John Goodman as the jolly yet obscurely menacing Charlie Meadows) who drops by for a friendly nip of hooch and winds up making off with our time, our inspiration and possibly — or so it’s suggested in “Barton Fink’s” violent third-act conflagration — our soul. The bitter acceptance of our own fraudulence, flowing in a continuously alternating current with the grandiloquent conviction that this time, by gum, we’ve broken the whole thing wide open.\n\nThere are films about writers — Jane Campion’s luminous Keats biopic “Bright Star” comes to mind — that capture the potential of literature to distill the essence of a human life (it helps when the writer’s words really are sublime, and as well used and understood by the filmmaker as Keats’s are by Campion). But “Barton Fink” is remarkable for just the opposite: its wicked, earthbound honesty about both the sinkhole of authorial self-obsession and the often sub-sublime results of those triumphant typing montages. The movie’s first, more realistic section is separated from its oneiric second half by a spectacular tracking shot that dives down the drain of a hotel sink, symbolizing the hero’s descent into damnation, madness or both. But my first thought every time I see that camera go down the drain is: Well, so much for that deadline.\n\nDana Stevens is the film critic at Slate and a co-host of the Slate Culture Gabfest podcast.

            "text": "White House: Not So Fast On that Keystone XL Pipeline, Cause “Climate Change”\n\nSo, the President with a carbon footprint around 41K metric tons, and a Sec of State who constantly takes fossil fueled flights all over the world, and also owns several homes and multiple fossil fueled vehicles, are telling us to hold our horses on Keystone XL\n\n(Fox News) A new environmental assessment from the State Department that raised no major environmental concerns on long-delayed Keystone XL pipeline isn’t the last step in deciding whether the pipeline can be built, the White House said late Friday. The long-delayed pipeline got a major boost as it cleared a major hurdle toward approval, a serious blow to environmentalists’ hopes that President Obama will block the controversial project running more than 1,000 miles from Canada through the heart of the U.S. The White House released a statement pushing back on the notion that the pipeline is now headed for speedy approval, saying Sec. of State John Kerry and other agency heads will “closely evaluate” the report in the coming weeks. “The president has clearly stated that the project will be in the national interest only if it does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution,” White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said.\n\nAmazing. Kerry’s own State Dept releases a report stating that Keystone will have negligible impacts on the environment, and, from that link\n\nThe department’s long-awaited environmental impact statement appears to indicate that the project could pass the criteria Mr. Obama set forth in a speech last summer when he said he would approve the 1,700-mile pipeline if it would not “significantly exacerbate” the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Although the pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada to the Gulf Coast, the report appears to indicate that if it were not built, carbon-heavy oil would still be extracted at the same rate from pristine Alberta forest and transported to refineries by rail instead.\n\nOne way or another, that oil will flow. Either the US can get it, or Canada will send it to China and other countries. Why would the American President and his SecState not want Americans to have inexpensive energy? Well, because they are far left hyper-partisans, for one thing. Also, massive climahypocrites.\n\nIn other words, Obama and Kerry will stonewall this for months, if not years. There’s no way they’ll approve it prior to the 2014 mid-terms, not wanting to keep the unhinged far left base from showing up to vote “D”.\n\nEven if that were true, it would still be more permanent jobs than all his “green jobs” programs, quite a few which have gone bust, others which took the loans and created far, far fewer jobs than they initially stated.\n\nWhich is more important? Energy for Americans, which can help with reducing consumer costs, or the fake issue of “carbon pollution”, of which Obama and Kerry are in the top 1% of offenders?",

the national science foundation and the department of energy will photograph almost the whole sky every few days also from chile credit lsst corporation a ceremony for laying the first stone is

which will produce an image of the entire sky every few days and over 10 years will produce a movie of the universe swamping astronomers with data that will enable them to spot everything that moves or blinks in the heavens including asteroids and supernova explosions among the stars what about outer space where the stars actually are it was frontpage news two years ago when the national reconnaissance office which operates spy satellites gave nasa two space telescopes the same size and design as a hubble that had been sitting in a warehouse some astronomers notably the former astronaut and hubble repairman john m grunsfeld nasas associate administrator for science mission suggested that one of these could be used to jumpstart a mission to study dark energy the national academy of sciences had ranked that mission atop the todo list for this decade but it was ambushed by the rising cost of nasas james webb space telescope more on that later continue reading the main story partners in telescope making a billiondollar telescope capable of outperforming hubble cant be built by a backyard stargazer or even a single university the thirty meter telescope in hawaii and the giant magellan in chile both now on the verge of construction are the products of international teams that have pursued their dreams even through a global recession a committee from the academy has recently endorsed the idea of using the spy telescope which is 24 meters in diameter for the mission instead of the originally envisioned onemeter telescope the academy agreed that the bigger telescope would enhance the scientific returns of the mission now known as wfirstafta for wide field infrared survey telescopeastrophysics focused telescope assets but warned that it could increase the cost and complexity congress directed nasa to spend 56 million on the mission in the last fiscal year 2014 and the proposed budget for 2015 includes about 14 million if this keeps up said david spergel an astronomer at princeton who is involved with the academy and the telescope the mission could start as early as 2023 near the time the european space agency will send up its own dark energy probe known as euclid by then he said the missions name would probably be less of a mouthful the good thing about wfirstafta dr spergel wrote in an email is that there is no way that we will keep that name among the possibilities that nasa is studying closely is adding a coronagraph to the telescope coronagraphs are basically opaque disks that were invented to black the intense light from the sun so astronomers could study the feathery faint corona of hot gases streaming outward from it exoplanet hunters are eager to deploy them to look for planets around distant stars getting a coronagraph on the dark energy telescope would be a valuable step toward a future mission once known as the terrestrial planet finder and now known by the placeholder name of new worlds telescope long a dream of exoplanet hunters that would be able to study earthlike planets for signs of habitability weather and life and then there is the most expensive and highflying big eye of all nasas james webb space telescope which nature magazine once called the telescope that ate astronomy named for a former administrator of nasa it is the successor to hubble which is still going strong thank you but is almost three times its size with a 65meterdiameter mirror that will have to fold out like a flower in orbit the webb telescope was supposed to be launched this year but was late and burned past its 5 billion budget like one of nasas rockets devouring money that could have gone toward other projects the house appropriations committee once voted to cancel it but the project was reinstated with a budget cap of 8 billion and a launch date of 2018 since then no news has basically been good news for webb it is still on track for 2018 nasa says in july the agency reported that it had finished testing the framework that will hold the leaves of the telescope mirror and scientific instruments in place photo a rendering of the giant magellan telescope that will be constructed atop a mountain in chile credit giant magellan telescope heat and light the webb telescope was built to study the first stars and galaxies that emerged in the hundred million years or so after the big bang a missing period in cosmic history it is therefore designed to record infrared radiation rather than visible light because objects at that distance and vintage are flying away from us so fast by the rules of the expanding universe that their light has been redshifted to longer wavelengths as it happens infrared or heat radiation is an excellent way to study planets which tend to emit more heat than light astronomers have long hoped that spectroscopic observations of an exoplanet atmosphere might reveal the signatures of life such as oxygen or chlorophyll recently some astronomers have suggested they might even be able to see industrial pollution as well in particular chlorofluorocarbons the greenhouse gases that also destroy ozone over a few millenniums of industry the thinking goes some of these gases could build up to levels detectable from far away and stay that way for 50000 years it would be ominous however henry w lin a student at harvard and his colleagues wrote in a paper submitted to the astrophysical journal if astronomers see the markers of pollution around some distant planet but no indications of present life that detection they wrote might serve as an additional warning to the intelligent life here on earth about the risks of industrial pollution the future belongs to those who plan and care for it last but hardly least is the hubble space telescope which has been providing humanity with matchless cosmic postcards from its perch above the sky ever since it was launched in 1990 and first fixed in 1993 hubble was last visited and serviced by astronauts — presumably for the final time — in 2009 matt mountain the director of the space telescope science institute reports that it is doing well a recent nasa review concluded he said in an email that hubble is operating at or near the highest level of performance and scientific productivity in its history recent estimates of its orbit suggest that it will reenter earths atmosphere no earlier than 2027 and will probably stay up well into the 2030s its main instruments are likely to still be working in 2020 that means the hubble will still be operational when the webb telescope goes up in 2018 it looks like it dr mountain said we are certainly setting our planning that way",

Two years ago, another group of astronomers blasted away the top of another mountain in Chile, Las Campanas, where they plan to build the Giant Magellan Telescope. That telescope will have at its heart a set of seven eight-meter mirrors ganged together to make the equivalent of a mirror 25 meters in diameter. Three of those mirrors have been cast and polished at the University of Arizona, one of the Giant Magellan partners. A fourth mirror is on order for next year.\n\nWendy Freedman, the director of the Carnegie Observatories, one of the spearheads of the Magellan collaboration, said by email that members were now in the final phases of forming a limited liability corporation, the legal and financial entity that will build and own the telescope. To date, the group has raised about $500 million of the $880 million (2012 dollars) needed for their telescope.

But for red tape, construction was also supposed to have started this month on the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope on Pachón Mountain, in, yes, Chile. That telescope, a joint project of the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, is eight meters in diameter. That mountain was dynamited back in 2011.

Parenteau took issue with the report’s statement that the process of harvesting oil sands in Canada, which creates just 17 percent more carbon emissions than regular oil, would still be done even if the pipeline weren’t built.\n\n“The logic of saying, ‘We don’t have to take this into account, because it will happen anyway,’ is sort of self-defeating,” he said. “That kind of thinking just keeps us trapped in the dilemma that we’re in.”\n\nPresident Obama has 90 days from release of the report to make a decision on whether to go forward with the pipeline, which would run 1,700 miles and carry more than 800,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta, Canada, through Montana and Nebraska, where it will connect with existing pipelines. Secretary of State John Kerry similarly must recommend a course of action to the president. The report also will go through a 30-day comment period.\n\nAt the beginning of 2012, Obama stalled the pipeline, saying that there wasn’t enough time to review the facts he had before the deadline he was given.\n\nParenteau said he thinks it’s likely that Obama will reject the pipeline because of comments he recently made on one of the largest stages his presidency offers.\n\n“Climate change is a fact,” Obama said in this year’s State of the Union address. “And when our children’s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say yes, we did.”\n\n“This is a promise to his kids,” Parenteau said. “I don’t see any way that he could make a decision to approve this.”\n\nMelissa Scanlan, the director of the Environmental Law Center and an associate professor of law at the Vermont Law School, wrote in an email on Sunday that Obama’s pending decision has become a “proxy for the larger debate on climate change.”\n\nShe added that the three months leading up to Obama’s decision will be rife with opinions and critiques on Friday’s report, as well as its “legal and factual bases.”\n\nSome took the report — and its mention that the pipeline wouldn’t much worsen carbon pollution — as a positive sign.\n\n“After five years and five environmental reviews, time and time again the Department of State analysis has shown that the pipeline is safe for the environment,” Cindy Schild, the senior manager of the American Petroleum Institute’s refining and oil sands program, told the Associated Press.\n\nIf the pipeline is built, it would support more than 40,000 jobs during its two-year construction period, whether direct or indirect. It would create about 50 jobs once it is up and running.\n\nSeveral drivers polled on Sunday outside the Co-Op Service Center in Hanover expressed distaste for the pipeline.\n\nThough he drove his Toyota Tacoma to the gas station to fill it up, Hugh MacArthur said his other car is a Prius. He mostly uses the truck to get around the back roads of Thetford, where he lives.\n\nMacArthur said he believes the process of harvesting oil sands is harmful to the environment, and the problem is made worse because the substance, if spilled while traveling the pipeline, is tough to clean up.\n\n“There’s no good way to do it,” he said. “Let’s not do it.”\n\nTammie Patten, of Hanover, said the country has been stuck on oil for too long, and a pipeline transferring it down the U.S. doesn’t help matters.\n\n“I do think that we really need to be better environmental citizens and we should be reducing our dependence on oil,” Patten said. “We ought to be looking for other alternatives.”\n\nJon Wolper can be reached at jwolper@vnews.com or 603-727-3242.

            "text": "On January 31, the U.S. Department of State released a long-awaited supplementary report on the environmental impact of the construction of TransCanada’s (NYSE:TRP) proposed Keystone pipeline, and its findings paved the pay for federal approval of the project. The assessment concluded that the Keystone XL pipeline — with its capacity to carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day — would not substantially accelerate carbon pollution. The report also appeared to indicated that if the pipeline is not built, oil would be extracted from pristine Alberta forest at the same rate, but it would instead be transported to the Gulf Coast refineries by rail. With the environmental impact understood, it is up to Secretary of State John Kerry to recommend to President Barack Obama whether to approve the project, and as the nation awaits his decision, protesters are pushing the Obama administration to reject the pipeline.\n\nTo many experts in the energy sector, the State Department’s discovery that the construction of the Keystone pipeline will do little to impact that amount of oil drilled in Alberta’s Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin is hardly surprising. “At the end of the day, there’s a consensus among most energy experts that the oil will get shipped to market no matter what,” Robert McNally, an energy consultant who was a senior energy and economic adviser to President George W. Bush, told the New York Times. “It’s less important than I think it was perceived to be a year ago, both politically and on oil markets.” Still, opponents of the project have made clear that their concern for its environmental impact has not lessened. After, the transport of oil by rail has hazards as well; as the use of railroads in oil transportation has increased, so too have the incidents of explosions of rail cars carrying oil.\n\nThe latest demonstration saw the arrest of 300 protesters on Sunday, reported Politico. Students from as many as 80 colleges gathered initially at Georgetown University and marched toward the White House after making a stop at Kerry’s home in Washington. Some came dressed in painter’s scrubs covered in black paint, meant to represent hazmat suits covered in oil, while others held signs bearing slogans like “Keystone XL: pipeline to hell” and “Keep your oil out of my soil.” Upon reaching the White House, many protesters took plastic zip ties to affix themselves to the fence surrounding the presidential residence. Remaining protesters stood around them holding banners. Together, they chanted: “Hey, Obama, we don’t want no pipeline drama.”\n\nMeanwhile, blocks away at the Lafayette Square Park, approximately 50 laid down on a black tarp, creating a visual representation of a “human oil spill,” reported Politico. From the perimeters, other protesters threw plastic lobsters, fish, and birds that were covered in black paint onto the “spill.” Law enforcement soon blockaded the scene.\n\nThis is “a youth-organized action to tell President Obama to reject the Keystone Pipeline,” Nick Stracco, who participated in the XL Dissent demonstration, told CNN. “Because the youth vote was a crucial part in both of his elections, we know that we elected him and we voted for a climate champion, not another pipeline president.” Similarly, Smith College freshman and an organizer of the event, Aly Johnson-Kurts, told Politico shortly before she was arrested at the White House that, “The youth really understand the traditional methods of creating change are not sufficient … so we needed to escalate.” Still, some students did not express much confidence that Obama would deny the project given the country’s pressing economic problems.\n\nEconomic problems — namely, the large numbers of still-unemployment Americans — is among the reasons the Republican party supports the construction project. “Another day and another government report that finds no reason to continue blocking this common-sense, job-creating project,” Brendan Buck, a spokesperson for House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, wrote in an email to the Times. “It’s long past time the president stop pandering to his extremist allies and just approve it so we can get people back to work.” It is important to note that the number of jobs the project will create is limited. According to the Cornell Global Labor Institute, the pipeline would create about 3,900 construction jobs over two years.\n\nThe approval of the application to build the Keystone XL project — the 1,700-mile, $5.3 billion pipeline that would transport tar sands oil from Alberta, Canada to Gulf Coast refineries — has not yet reached the end of its journey, complicated by pressure from environmentalist groups concerned for the impact on carbon pollution and from congressional lawmakers eager for the White House to come to a decision. In December  2011, led by ranking Republicans, Congress passed a law giving the Obama Administration a 60-day deadline to approve or reject the application, but President Barack Obama rejected the application, noting that the deadline for the decision had “prevented a full assessment of the pipeline’s impact.” So, Keystone filed a new permit application, and the State Department prepared a supplement to its 2011 environmental impact report. The original report found that there was insufficient time “to obtain the information necessary to assess whether the project, in its current state, is in the national interest.”\n\nIt is because the pipeline will cross an international border that its construction depends on the approval of the president, while determining whether the pipeline is in the national interest and can be built safely is the responsibility of the State Department.\n\n“This is the most scrutinized pipeline in the nation’s history,” Brigham A. McCown, a former administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, told the Times after the State Department’s January 31 announcement. “The fact that it’s lasted as long as it has means one of two things. They’ve either done a very good, thorough job, or they’ve slowed it down due to political pressure.”\n\nWhile it may be the most scrutinized pipeline in history, the project is not as politically important as it once was, as McNally noted. As the Times learned through sources close to the president, Obama does see his response to environmental issues as part of his legacy, he does not believe the pipeline is a central part of his policy efforts any longer. Rather proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulations on coal-fired power plants — currently the country’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions — is at the top of his agenda. Of course, those new regulations do not have the same political symbolism of the pipeline, but they would have a greater impact on limiting U.S. greenhouse gas emission by closing hundreds of coal plants and halting construction of new plants.",

that the state department signs a permit without wh approval keystone xl pipeline project key issues the executive branch has exercised permitting authority over the construction and operation of pipelines conveyor belts and similar facilities for the exportation or importation of petroleum petroleum products and other products at least since the promulgation of executive order 11423 in 1968 executive order 13337 amended this authority and the procedures associated with the review but did not substantially alter the exercise of authority or the delegation to the secretary in eo 11423 however the source of the executive branchs permitting authority is not entirely clear from the text of these executive orders generally powers exercised by the executive branch are authorized by legislation or are inherent presidential powers based in the constitution eo 11423 makes no mention of any authority and eo 13337 refers only to the constitution and the laws of the united states of america including section 301 of title 3 united states code section 301 simply provides that the president is empowered to delegate authority to the head of any department or agency of the executive branch the legitimacy of this permitting authority has been addressed by federal courts in sisseton v united states department of state the plaintiff tribes filed suit and asked the court to suspend or revoke the presidential permit issued under eo 13337 for the transcanada keystone pipeline the us district court for the district of south dakota found that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they would be unable to prove their injury could be redressed by a favorable decision the court determined that even if the plaintiffs injury could be redressed the president would be free to disregard the courts judgment as the case concerned the presidents inherent constitutional authority to conduct foreign policy as opposed to statutory authority granted to the president by congress the court further found that even if the tribes had standing the issuance of the presidential permit was a presidential action not an agency action subject to judicial review under the administrative procedure act apa the court stated that the authority to regulate the crossborder pipeline lies with either congress or the president the court found that congress has failed to create a federal regulatory scheme for the construction of oil pipelines and has delegated this authority to the states therefore the president has the sole authority to allow oil pipeline border crossings under his inherent constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs the president could delegate his permitting authority to the us department of state but delegation did not transform the permits issuance into an agency action reviewable under the apa in sierra club v clinton the plaintiff sierra club challenged the secretarys decision to issue a presidential permit authorizing the alberta clipper pipeline among the plaintiffs claims was an allegation that issuance of the permit was unconstitutional because the president had no authority to issue the permits referenced in eo 13337 in this case for the importation of crude oil from canada via pipeline the defendant responded that the authority to issue presidential permits for these bordercrossing facilities does not derive from a delegation of congressional authority but rather from the presidents constitutional authority over foreign affairs and his authority as commander in chief the us district court for the district of minnesota agreed noting that the defendants assertion regarding the source of the presidents authority has been well recognized in a series of attorney general opinions as well as a 2009 judicial opinion the court also noted that these permits had been issued many times before and that congress has not attempted to exercise any exclusive authority over the permitting process congresss inaction suggests that congress has accepted the authority of the president to issue crossborder permits based on the historical recognition of the presidents authority to issue these permits and congresss implied approval through inaction the court found the presidential permit requirement for border facilities constitutional 26 posted on 02172014 83527 am pst by kabar to kabar have the past presidential

            "text": "Democrats who oppose the Keystone XL pipeline have thousands of dollars invested in direct competitors to the company looking to build the pipeline, public records show.\n\nA recent environmental assessment by the State Department was seen as a step toward the pipelines approval, but Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.) remains opposed to its construction.\n\nIn my view, there is now enough evidence to conclude that construction of this pipeline is not in Americas long-term interest, Kaine said in a statement on the review.\n\nThe freshman Democrat has between $15,000 and $50,000 invested in Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, according to his most recent financial disclosure. Kinder Morgan is looking to build a pipeline that would directly compete with Keystone.\n\nKinder Morgan is considering expanding its Canadian pipeline infrastructure with an expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline, which carries oil sands crude from Alberta to refineries and export terminals on Canadas west coast.\n\n\n\nThe State Department has not approved it. The environmental report was part of their review process. It is controlled by the White House only in that the State Department reports to the President. For proposed petroleum pipelines that cross\n\n international borders of the United States, the President,\n\n through Executive Order (EO) 13337, directs the\n\n Secretary of State to decide whether a project serves the\n\n national interest before granting a Presidential Permit. To make this decision (i.e., the National Interest\n\n Determination), the Secretary of State, through the\n\n Department, considers many factors, including energy\n\n security; environmental, cultural, and economic\n\n impacts; foreign policy; and compliance with relevant\n\n state and federal regulations. This Supplemental EIS\n\n was produced consistent with the National\n\n Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and will help inform\n\n that determination. Before making such a decision, the\n\n Department also asks for the views of eight federal\n\n agencies identified in EO 13337: the Departments of\n\n Energy, Defense, Transportation, Homeland Security,\n\n Justice, Interior, and Commerce, as well as the\n\n U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). If the proposed Project is determined to serve the\n\n national interest, it will be granted a Presidential Permit\n\n that authorizes the construction, connection, operation,\n\n and maintenance of the facilities at the border between\n\n the United States and Canada. The applicant would be\n\n required to abide by certain conditions listed in this\n\n Supplemental EIS and the Presidential Permit. The\n\n Departments primary role is to make a National\n\n Interest Determination. Its jurisdiction does not include\n\n selection of specific pipeline routes within the\n\n United States. \n\n\n\nThe decision is made in the WH. I worked for the State Department for 28 years. This is a Kabuki dance. The State Department released a report on Friday concluding that the Keystone XL pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution, leaving an opening for President Obama to approve the politically divisive project. The departments long-awaited environmental impact statement appears to indicate that the project could pass the criteria Mr. Obama set forth in a speech last summer when he said he would approve the 1,700-mile pipeline if it would not significantly exacerbate the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Although the pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada to the Gulf Coast, the report appears to indicate that if it were not built, carbon-heavy oil would still be extracted at the same rate from pristine Alberta forest and transported to refineries by rail instead. The report sets up a difficult decision for Secretary of State John Kerry, who now must make a recommendation on the international project to Mr. Obama. Mr. Kerry, who hopes to make action on climate change a key part of his legacy, has never publicly offered his personal views on the pipeline. Aides said Mr. Kerry was preparing to dive into the 11-volume report and would give high priority to the issue of global warming in making the decision. His aides offered no timetable.\" Anyone who thinks that Kerry has any real input into the decision is living in a fantasy world. These multiple reports from the State Department are just delaying tactics. Obama will decide, not the State Department. \n\n\n\nFor one thing Kaine is a Senator, so the House ethics committee has nothing to say about him. \n\n\n\nWhile lots of lame stream media write it up that way. The Presidential Permit is actually issued by the State Department. So this environmental impact statement is only one factor that the Secretary will take into account as he weighs many other elements in making a decision. Obviously, for the Secretary, climate and environmental priorities are part of his decision making, quite frankly. So again, weve talked a lot publicly about it. Thats where the process is right now, that there is this document that has been put out. Agencies have 90 days, public has 30 days, and the Secretary will take into account all of that as he makes a decision. The Secretary of State has the authority to issue Presidential Permits for cross-border liquid (water as well as petroleum product) pipelines and other cross-border infrastructure. The Bureau of Energy Resources Office of Energy Diplomacy receives and processes permit applications. \n\n\n\nfrom the April 1, 2013 issue of the National Law Journal\n\n http://www.pipelinelaw.com/files/2014/02/After_Keystone_A_question_of_presidential_permits.pdf As the name suggests, presidential permits are a creation of the executive branch alone, with no\n\n legislative authorization and limited judicial review to date. Presidential permits are intended to\n\n provide executive branch review of trans-border facilities and commercial activities between the\n\n United States and either Canada or Mexico. No statute authorizes their creation or use, and few\n\n regulations govern their review or issuance. In 1968, permitting authority for oil pipelines, among other facilities, was officially delegated to the State Department under President Lyndon Johnsons Executive Order 11,423 and amended by another executive order in 1994 to include requirements to consult with various federal departments. In 2004, an executive order by President George W. Bush established the State Departments procedures for reviewing presidential permit applications for oil pipelines. Those procedures include referral of the application and request for consulting agency reviews within 90 days and directions to approve those applications that serve the national interest. The State Department is currently responsible for issuing presidential permits for oil pipelines, -while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issues such permits for natural gas pipelines, and the Department of Energy (DOE) issues presidential permits for electric transmission lines. Both FERC and DOE have promulgated regulations governing their presidential permit process. \n\n\n\nI don't understand your fixation on who signs the permit for the US when the decision is made in the WH. The State Department acknowledges that they recommend a course of action, but the decision is made in the WH. And Obama has said that he makes the decision. There is no way that the State Department signs a permit without WH approval. The executive branch has exercised permitting authority over the construction and operation of pipelines, conveyor belts, and similar facilities for the exportation or importation of petroleum, petroleum products and other products at least since the promulgation of Executive Order 11423 in 1968. Executive Order 13337 amended this authority and the procedures associated with the review, but did not substantially alter the exercise of authority or the delegation to the Secretary in E.O. 11423. However, the source of the executive branchs permitting authority is not entirely clear from the text of these Executive Orders. Generally, powers exercised by the executive branch are authorized by legislation or are inherent presidential powers based in the Constitution. E.O. 11423 makes no mention of any authority, and E.O. 13337 refers only to the Constitution and the Laws of the United States of America, including Section 301 of title 3, United States Code. Section 301 simply provides that the President is empowered to delegate authority to the head of any department or agency of the executive branch. The legitimacy of this permitting authority has been addressed by federal courts. In Sisseton v. United States Department of State , the plaintiff Tribes filed suit and asked the court to suspend or revoke the Presidential Permit issued under E.O. 13337 for the TransCanada Keystone Pipeline. The U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota found that the plaintiffs lacked standing because they would be unable to prove their injury could be redressed by a favorable decision. The court determined that even if the plaintiffs injury could be redressed, the President would be free to disregard the courts judgment, as the case concerned the Presidents inherent Constitutional authority to conduct foreign policy, as opposed to statutory authority granted to the President by Congress. The court further found that even if the Tribes had standing, the issuance of the Presidential Permit was a presidential action, not an agency action subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The court stated that the authority to regulate the cross-border pipeline lies with either Congress or the President. The court found that Congress has failed to create a federal regulatory scheme for the construction of oil pipelines, and has delegated this authority to the states. Therefore, the President has the sole authority to allow oil pipeline border crossings under his inherent constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs. The President could delegate his permitting authority to the U.S. Department of State, but delegation did not transform the permits issuance into an agency action reviewable under the APA. In Sierra Club v. Clinton , the plaintiff Sierra Club challenged the Secretarys decision to issue a Presidential Permit authorizing the Alberta Clipper pipeline. Among the plaintiffs claims was an allegation that issuance of the permit was unconstitutional because the President had no authority to issue the permits referenced in E.O. 13337 (in this case, for the importation of crude oil from Canada via pipeline). The defendant responded that the authority to issue Presidential Permits for these border-crossing facilities does not derive from a delegation of congressional authority ... but rather from the Presidents constitutional authority over foreign affairs and his authority as Commander in Chief. The U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota agreed, noting that the defendants assertion regarding the source of the Presidents authority has been well recognized in a series of Attorney General opinions, as well as a 2009 judicial opinion. The court also noted that these permits had been issued many times before and that Congress has not attempted to exercise any exclusive authority over the permitting process. Congresss inaction suggests that Congress has accepted the authority of the President to issue cross-border permits. Based on the historical recognition of the Presidents authority to issue these permits and Congresss implied approval through inaction, the court found the Presidential Permit requirement for border facilities constitutional. \n\n\n\nHave the past Presidential pipeline border crossing permits been issued by the State Department, or by the President? Do you mean who signed them or who approved them? There is a clearance process and it goes thru the WH, which has the final say. And something as controversial as the Keystone pipeline will be managed and directed from the WH. These are Presidential decisions, which is why the courts ruled that they are not subject to judicial review. The court further found that even if the Tribes had standing, the issuance of the Presidential Permit was a presidential action, not an agency action subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Again, I don't understand your point. John Kerry is going to make a recommendation to the WH, a recommendation that will be the product of an intra-agency review. But the WH, and only the WH, will decide the issue. The President can disregard the recommendation, if he so chooses. Of course, we know that the WH will have a major role in writing the State Department recommendation so that Obama has the cover he needs politically to make the call. This is a political decision. There have been five different studies to string the process along. The State Department is the puppet and Obama is the puppeteer. \n\n\n\nI see, and have posted, several items from the State Department and from the Executive Order that directly contradicts that. They don't contradict what I posted. The State Department has been designated the lead agency to receive applications for Presidential permits and to coordinate review by the national security agencies. I provided you with State Department report to Congress on the Keystone pipeline that clearly indicates that the State Department provides recommendations, but the President makes the determination. The courts have determined that the President has the right to make these decisions stemming from his inherent Constitutional authority to conduct foreign policy, as opposed to statutory authority granted to the President by Congress. \"The President could delegate his permitting authority to the U.S. Department of State, but delegation did not transform the permits issuance into an agency action reviewable under the APA.\" These cross-border permits are considered as part of national security, which means that the President as CIC can make such decisions rather than Congress. Do you dispute that the President makes the final determination? If not, then what is his role? have to wonder on this pipeline, at this time, both are trying to use the other as blame when the approval goes through. I assume by \"both\" you mean the State Department and the WH. I have a profound disagreement with your statement. The WH and the State Department are working together to execute whatever the President wants. Again, the State Department is the puppet and the President the puppeteer. The puppet doesn't do anything the puppeteer doesn't want it to do. \n\n\n\nI see that as a clear statement; they have the authority. The only authority they have is what the WH gives them. They don't have the authority to make a decision on the Keystone Pipeline. The President has clearly arrogated that decision to himself. I agree that on THIS pipeline, they have done a CYA recommendation, but that is not how the rules are written, nor has been done on past projects. But following the rules is not a strong point of this administration. LOL. Please, it is not a CYA recommendation. The President will make the decision or non-decision. Whatever the State Department does is at the direction of the President. The State Department is not a free agent. It works for the President. Maybe you have more insight into how this process works since I only have 28 years working for the State Department and 36 years total as a federal employee. I suspect at this point, neither of us are going to convince they other.\n\nDisclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.
