falling stars starfish dying from �disintegrating� disease populations have been decimated in recent months and scientists are racing to find out why by katy steinmetz san francisco nov 05 2013 when marine researchers from the university of california at santa cruz traveled to alaska this summer they noticed something unsettling in the waters near sitka populations of starfish were losing their arms then other reports started pouring in to their laboratory from southern california to british columbia uncounted numbers of one of america�s best known sea species appeared to be disintegrating it�s normal for a tiny portion of starfish populations to suffer from socalled �wasting syndrome� if the creatures� skin is wounded or becomes too dry little lesions can become infected and lead to the loss of arms but the disease is typically isolated to one or two starfish among hundreds in a rocky tide pool and even in bad cases it rarely stretches beyond a single population �the spatial extent is unprecedented� says pete raimondi chair of the ecology and evolutionary biology department at uc santa cruz which monitors starfish populations on the west coast �if it�s as extensive as it looks like it is then we�re talking about a loss of millions and millions� though starfish generally have the ability to grow new arms in these cases wounds don�t heal and innards become exposed as the animal falls apart so what gives it could be environmental factors a virus bacteria or some combination wasting syndrome actually describes a whole set of symptoms without a universal cause when other outbreaks struck the west coast in recent decades scientists identified warm water as the likely culprit starfish are primarily cooler water species so when the water heats up it compromises their health making them more susceptible to infected wounds raimondi says bacteria also divide faster in warmer temperatures meaning disease can spread more quickly but the west coast has been in a coldwater period �right now we don�t really have a culprit� raimondi says httpsciencetimecom20131105fixzz2jrdqjlyo safety and security dont just happen they are the result of collective consensus and

finding a full text article on this topic tonka something notable about the current mass mortality is that we are not in an ocean warming period as was the case in the previous episodes quote one severe case of sea star wasting disease was noted in heliaster kubiniji in the gulf of california in 1978 dungan et al 1982 the species was virtually eliminated by the disease and to date recovery has not occurred at some sites in the gulf of california where it used to be abundant d thomson pers comm sea temperature data from the scripps pier since 1920 indicate that a longterm warming trend has occurred in southern california from 1976 to 1998 initial appearance of sea star wasting disease occurred two years after the start of the warming trend and has been noted periodically since then channel islands national park annual reports engle unpublished data there apparently is a relationship between increased seawater temperature and incidence of the disease in the channel islands eckert in prep sea star wasting disease has not been limited to southern california in fact menge 1979 describes a similar kind of wasting disease in 1972 in the sea star asterias vulgaris in maine it is interesting that the 1978 observation of sea star wasting disease in the gulf of california dungan et al 1982 coincided with observations of the disease in southern california engle unpublished data the etiologic agent responsible for the disease has been preliminarily identified as a vibrio bacteria schroeter et al unpublished manuscript crowell pers comm one preliminary conclusion is that extended warming periods compromise the immune system crowell pers comm sea stars can recover from the disease if put into cold water and death has been noted within seven days of onset of the disease

since july of last year sea stars across the east and west coast have been dying by the hundreds of thousands according to prof ian hewson microbiology as a result he is investigating whether a waterborne microorganism is behind what has now been coined �sea star wasting disease� previous mass sea star deaths have been correlated to dramatic climatological events such as el nino el nino is a periodic warming of a band of water in the pacific ocean that develops off the coast of south america in the 1970s el nino caused a massive upwelling of nutrient rich water which created ideal conditions for several pathogens that killed off sea stars but according to hewson no climaterelated link has been found with the current sea star wasting disease �essentially they are sea water and it is difficult to exclude a lot of bacteria from the analysis because they have it running through their veins so to speak� hewson said � when hiv first started the main symptoms that people were turning up with were all manners of weird infections which were not actually the root of the disease� hewson said �it took some time to find what the cause was the hiv virus we�re dealing with a

the animals causing growing lesions that break their bodies apart reports of further losses from the disease which has all but eradicated multiple sea star species in certain spots now stretch from alaska to mexico it has been called �sea star wasting syndrome� because some of the signs resemble those of conditions seen before on both north american coasts however this may be a misnomer as the ongoing event has a number of characteristics distinguishing it from past known outbreaks rather than a wasting them away the condition can progress quite rapidly even in very healthy animals although typical outbreaks affect a single species and end with the onset of winter the current outbreak is hammering at least a dozen species and still going strong as spring approaches harvell is currently

understanding what is happening the condition is likely infectious but they can�t yet identify the transmission route this identification is always a challenge but particularly in marine research

species hit hardest the ochre star was the focus of the seminal paper that introduced the term �keystone species� a species whose populations keeps others in check the ochres are especially important in keeping mussel populations from overtaking rocky habitats and all of the species affected are predatory �there�s just no question there�s going to be a huge impacts for the subtidal seascape� says

741 pm updated friday aug 1 at 837 pm dr lesanna lahner at the seattle aquarium said they have separated a group of 50 sea stars showing signs of the wasting disease into two tubs they are treating one group with antibiotic injections and the other with a saline solution she said they don�t expect to cure wasting disease the antibiotics may have no affect at all on the disease itself but she said it could be that the disease only weakens the stars to the point they can not defend themselves against bacteria if the bacteria is what�s consuming the stars� bodies the antibiotics can help the

stalled the biggest mystery in climate science today may have begun unbeknownst to anybody at the time with a subtle weakening of the tropical trade winds blowing across the pacific ocean in late 1997 these winds normally push sunbaked water towards indonesia when they slackened the warm water sloshed back towards south america resulting in a spectacular example of a phenomenon known as el niño average global temperatures hit a record high in 1998 — and then the warming stalled for several years scientists wrote off the stall as noise in the climate system the natural variations in the atmosphere oceans and biosphere that drive warm or cool spells around the globe but the pause has persisted sparking a minor crisis of confidence in the field although there have been jumps and dips average atmospheric temperatures have risen little since 1998 in seeming defiance of projections of climate models and the everincreasing emissions of greenhouse gases climate sceptics have seized on the temperature trends as evidence that global warming has ground to a halt climate scientists meanwhile know that heat must still be building up somewhere in the climate system but they have struggled to explain where it is going if not into the atmosphere some have begun to wonder whether there is something amiss in their models now as the globalwarming hiatus enters its sixteenth year scientists are at last making headway in the case of the missing heat some have pointed to the sun volcanoes and even pollution from china as potential culprits but recent studies suggest that the oceans are key to explaining the anomaly the latest suspect is the el niño of 1997–98 which pumped prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere — perhaps enough to tip the equatorial pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since the 1997 to 98 el niño event was a trigger for the changes in the pacific and i think thats very probably the beginning of the hiatus says kevin trenberth a climate scientist at the national center for atmospheric research ncar in boulder colorado according to this theory the tropical pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming yearseventually trenberth says it will switch back in the other direction stark contrast on a chart of global atmospheric temperatures the hiatus stands in stark contrast to the rapid warming of the two decades that preceded it simulations conducted in advance of the 2013–14 assessment from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc suggest that the warming should have continued at an average rate of 021 °c per decade from 1998 to 2012 instead the observed warming during that period was just 004 °c per decade as measured by the uk met office in exeter and the climatic research unit at the university of east anglia in norwich uk the simplest explanation for both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the models is natural variability much like the swings between warm and cold in daytoday weather chaotic climate fluctuations can knock global temperatures up or down from year to year and decade to decade records of past climate show some longlasting global heatwaves and cold snaps and climate models suggest that either of these can occur as the world warms under the influence of greenhouse gases nate mantuanoaa but none of the climate simulations carried out for the ipcc produced this particular hiatus at this particular time that has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared others say that this conclusion goes against the longterm temperature trends as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past and many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively shortterm blip in the climate if you are interested in global climate change your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years says susan solomon a climate scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge but even those scientists who remain confident in the underlying models acknowledge that there is increasing pressure to work out just what is happening today a few years ago you saw the hiatus but it could be dismissed because it was well within the noise says gabriel vecchi a climate scientist at the us national oceanic and atmospheric administrations geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory in princeton new jersey now its something to explain researchers have followed various leads in recent years focusing mainly on a trio of factors the sun 1 atmospheric aerosol particles 2 and the oceans 3 the output of energy from the sun tends to wax and wane on an 11year cycle but the sun entered a prolonged lull around the turn of the millennium the natural 11year cycle is currently approaching its peak but thus far it has been the weakest solar maximum in a century this could help to explain both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the model simulations which include a higher solar output than earth has experienced since 2000 an unexpected increase in the number of stratospheric aerosol particles could be another factor keeping earth cooler than predicted these particles reflect sunlight back into space and scientists suspect that small volcanoes — and perhaps even industrialization in china — could have pumped extra aerosols into the stratosphere during the past 16 years depressing global temperatures some have argued that these two factors could be primary drivers of the hiatus but studies published in the past few years suggest that their effects are likely to be relatively small 4 5 trenberth for example analysed their impacts on the basis of satellite measurements of energy entering and exiting the planet and estimated that aerosols and solar activity account for just 20 of the hiatus that leaves the bulk of the hiatus to the oceans which serve as giant sponges for heat and here the spotlight falls on the equatorial pacific blowing hot and cold just before the hiatus took hold that region had turned unusually warm during the el niño of 1997–98 which fuelled extreme weather across the planet from floods in chile and california to droughts and wildfires in mexico and indonesia but it ended just as quickly as it had begun and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of el niños sister effect la niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial pacific with a vengeance more importantly the entire eastern pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day this variation in ocean temperature known as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo may be a crucial piece of the hiatus puzzle the cycle reverses every 15–30 years and in its positive phase the oscillation favours el niño which tends to warm the atmosphere see the fickle ocean after a couple of decades of releasing heat from the eastern and central pacific the region cools and enters the negative phase of the pdo this state tends towards la niña which brings cool waters up from the depths along the equator and tends to cool the planet researchers identified the pdo pattern in 1997 but have only recently begun to understand how it fits in with broader oceancirculation patterns and how it may help to explain the hiatus one important finding came in 2011 when a team of researchers at ncar led by gerald meehl reported that inserting a pdo pattern into global climate models causes decadescale breaks in global warming 3 oceantemperature data from the recent hiatus reveal why in a subsequent study the ncar researchers showed that more heat moved into the deep ocean after 1998 which helped to prevent the atmosphere from warming 6 in a third paper the group used computer models to document the flip side of the process when the pdo switches to its positive phase it heats up the surface ocean and atmosphere helping to drive decades of rapid warming 7 a key breakthrough came last year from shangping xie and yu kosaka at the scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla california the duo took a different tack by programming a model with actual sea surface temperatures from recent decades in the eastern equatorial pacific and then seeing what happened to the rest of the globe 8 their model not only recreated the hiatus in global temperatures but also reproduced some of the seasonal and regional climate trends that have marked the hiatus including warming in many areas and cooler northern winters it was actually a revelation for me when i saw that paper says john fyfe a climate modeller at the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis in victoria but it did not he adds explain everything what it skirted was the question of what is driving the tropical cooling univ washingtonipcc that was investigated by trenberth and john fasullo also at ncar who brought in winds and ocean data to explain how the pattern emerges 4 their study documents how tropical trade winds associated with la niña conditions help to drive warm water westward and ultimately deep into the ocean while promoting the upwelling of cool waters along the eastern equatorial region in extreme cases such as the la niña of 1998 this may be able to push the ocean into a cool phase of the pdo an analysis of historical data buttressed these conclusions showing that the cool phase of the pdo coincided with a few decades of cooler temperatures after the second world war see the pacifics global reach and that the warm phase lined up with the sharp spike seen in global temperatures between 1976 and 1998 ref 4 i believe the evidence is pretty clear says mark cane a climatologist at columbia university in new york its not about aerosols or stratospheric water vapour its about having had a decade of cooler temperatures in the eastern equatorial pacific heated debate cane was the first to predict the current cooling in the pacific although the implications werent clear at the time in 2004 he and his colleagues found that a simple regional climate model predicted a warm shift in the pacific that began around 1976 when global temperatures began to rise sharply 9 almost as an afterthought they concluded their paper with a simple forecast for what it is worth the model predicts that the 1998 el niño ended the post1976 tropical pacific warm period it is an eerily accurate result but the work remains hotly contested in part because it is based on a partial climate model that focuses on the equatorial pacific alone cane further maintains that the trend over the past century has been towards warmer temperatures in the western pacific relative to those in the east that opens the door he says to the possibility that warming from greenhouse gases is driving la niñalike conditions and could continue to do so in the future helping to suppress global warming if all of that is true its a negative feedback and if we dont capture it in our models they will overstate the warming he says there are two potential holes in his assessment first the historical oceantemperature data are notoriously imprecise leading many researchers to dispute canes assertion that the equatorial pacific shifted towards a more la niñalike state during the past century 10 second many researchers have found the opposite pattern in simulations with full climate models which factor in the suite of atmospheric and oceanic interactions beyond the equatorial pacific these tend to reveal a trend towards more el niñolike conditions as a result of global warming the difference seems to lie in part in how warming influences evaporation in areas of the pacific according to trenberth he says the models suggest that global warming has a greater impact on temperatures in the relatively cool east because the increase in evaporation adds water vapour to the atmosphere there and enhances atmospheric warming this effect is weaker in the warmer western pacific where the air is already saturated with moisture scientists may get to test their theories soon enough at present strong tropical trade winds are pushing ever more warm water westward towards indonesia fuelling storms such as novembers typhoon haiyan and nudging up sea levels in the western pacific they are now roughly 20 centimetres higher than those in the eastern pacific sooner or later the trend will inevitably reverse you cant keep piling up warm water in the western pacific trenberth says at some point the water will get so high that it just sloshes back and when that happens if scientists are on the right track the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again",

These winds normally push sun-baked water towards Indonesia. When they slackened, the warm water sloshed back towards South America, resulting in a spectacular example of a phenomenon known as El Niño. Average global temperatures hit a record high in 1998 — and then the warming stalled.\n\nFor several years, scientists wrote off the stall as noise in the climate system: the natural variations in the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere that drive warm or cool spells around the globe. But the pause has persisted, sparking a minor crisis of confidence in the field. Although there have been jumps and dips, average atmospheric temperatures have risen little since 1998, in seeming defiance of projections of climate models and the ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. Climate sceptics have seized on the temperature trends as evidence that global warming has ground to a halt. Climate scientists, meanwhile, know that heat must still be building up somewhere in the climate system, but they have struggled to explain where it is going, if not into the atmosphere. Some have begun to wonder whether there is something amiss in their models.\n\nNow, as the global-warming hiatus enters its sixteenth year, scientists are at last making headway in the case of the missing heat. Some have pointed to the Sun, volcanoes and even pollution from China as potential culprits, but recent studies suggest that the oceans are key to explaining the anomaly. The latest suspect is the El Niño of 1997–98, which pumped prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere — perhaps enough to tip the equatorial Pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since.\n\n“The 1997 to ’98 El Niño event was a trigger for the changes in the Pacific, and I think that’s very probably the beginning of the hiatus,” says Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. According to this theory, the tropical Pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming years.“Eventually,” Trenberth says, “it will switch back in the other direction.”\n\nOn a chart of global atmospheric temperatures, the hiatus stands in stark contrast to the rapid warming of the two decades that preceded it. Simulations conducted in advance of the 2013–14 assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that the warming should have continued at an average rate of 0.21 °C per decade from 1998 to 2012. Instead, the observed warming during that period was just 0.04 °C per decade, as measured by the UK Met Office in Exeter and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK.\n\nThe simplest explanation for both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the models is natural variability. Much like the swings between warm and cold in day-to-day weather, chaotic climate fluctuations can knock global temperatures up or down from year to year and decade to decade. Records of past climate show some long-lasting global heatwaves and cold snaps, and climate models suggest that either of these can occur as the world warms under the influence of greenhouse gases.\n\nBut none of the climate simulations carried out for the IPCC produced this particular hiatus at this particular time. That has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases, and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared. Others say that this conclusion goes against the long-term temperature trends, as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past. And many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively short-term blip in the climate. “If you are interested in global climate change, your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years,” says Susan Solomon, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.\n\nBut even those scientists who remain confident in the underlying models acknowledge that there is increasing pressure to work out just what is happening today. “A few years ago you saw the hiatus, but it could be dismissed because it was well within the noise,” says Gabriel Vecchi, a climate scientist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. “Now it’s something to explain.”\n\nResearchers have followed various leads in recent years, focusing mainly on a trio of factors: the Sun1, atmospheric aerosol particles2 and the oceans3. The output of energy from the Sun tends to wax and wane on an 11-year cycle, but the Sun entered a prolonged lull around the turn of the millennium. The natural 11-year cycle is currently approaching its peak, but thus far it has been the weakest solar maximum in a century. This could help to explain both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the model simulations, which include a higher solar output than Earth has experienced since 2000.\n\nAn unexpected increase in the number of stratospheric aerosol particles could be another factor keeping Earth cooler than predicted. These particles reflect sunlight back into space, and scientists suspect that small volcanoes — and perhaps even industrialization in China — could have pumped extra aerosols into the stratosphere during the past 16 years, depressing global temperatures.\n\nSome have argued that these two factors could be primary drivers of the hiatus, but studies published in the past few years suggest that their effects are likely to be relatively small4, 5. Trenberth, for example, analysed their impacts on the basis of satellite measurements of energy entering and exiting the planet, and estimated that aerosols and solar activity account for just 20% of the hiatus. That leaves the bulk of the hiatus to the oceans, which serve as giant sponges for heat.

But it ended just as quickly as it had begun, and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of El Niño’s sister effect, La Niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial Pacific with a vengeance. More importantly, the entire eastern Pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day.\n\nThis variation in ocean temperature, known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), may be a crucial piece of the hiatus puzzle. The cycle reverses every 15–30 years, and in its positive phase, the oscillation favours El Niño, which tends to warm the atmosphere (see ‘The fickle ocean’). After a couple of decades of releasing heat from the eastern and central Pacific, the region cools and enters the negative phase of the PDO. This state tends towards La Niña, which brings cool waters up from the depths along the Equator and tends to cool the planet. Researchers identified the PDO pattern in 1997, but have only recently begun to understand how it fits in with broader ocean-circulation patterns and how it may help to explain the hiatus.\n\nOne important finding came in 2011, when a team of researchers at NCAR led by Gerald Meehl reported that inserting a PDO pattern into global climate models causes decade-scale breaks in global warming3. Ocean-temperature data from the recent hiatus reveal why: in a subsequent study, the NCAR researchers showed that more heat moved into the deep ocean after 1998, which helped to prevent the atmosphere from warming6. In a third paper, the group used computer models to document the flip side of the process: when the PDO switches to its positive phase, it heats up the surface ocean and atmosphere, helping to drive decades of rapid warming7.\n\nA key breakthrough came last year from Shang-Ping Xie and Yu Kosaka at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. The duo took a different tack, by programming a model with actual sea surface temperatures from recent decades in the eastern equatorial Pacific, and then seeing what happened to the rest of the globe8. Their model not only recreated the hiatus in global temperatures, but also reproduced some of the seasonal and regional climate trends that have marked the hiatus, including warming in many areas and cooler northern winters.\n\n“It was actually a revelation for me when I saw that paper,” says John Fyfe, a climate modeller at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis in Victoria. But it did not, he adds, explain everything. “What it skirted was the question of what is driving the tropical cooling.”\n\nThat was investigated by Trenberth and John Fasullo, also at NCAR, who brought in winds and ocean data to explain how the pattern emerges4. Their study documents how tropical trade winds associated with La Niña conditions help to drive warm water westward and, ultimately, deep into the ocean, while promoting the upwelling of cool waters along the eastern equatorial region. In extreme cases, such as the La Niña of 1998, this may be able to push the ocean into a cool phase of the PDO. An analysis of historical data buttressed these conclusions, showing that the cool phase of the PDO coincided with a few decades of cooler temperatures after the Second World War (see ‘The Pacific’s global reach’), and that the warm phase lined up with the sharp spike seen in global temperatures between 1976 and 1998 (ref. 4).\n\n“I believe the evidence is pretty clear,” says Mark Cane, a climatologist at Columbia University in New York. “It’s not about aerosols or stratospheric water vapour; it’s about having had a decade of cooler temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific.”\n\nCane was the first to predict the current cooling in the Pacific, although the implications weren’t clear at the time. In 2004, he and his colleagues found that a simple regional climate model predicted a warm shift in the Pacific that began around 1976, when global temperatures began to rise sharply9. Almost as an afterthought, they concluded their paper with a simple forecast: “For what it is worth the model predicts that the 1998 El Niño ended the post-1976 tropical Pacific warm period.”\n\nIt is an eerily accurate result, but the work remains hotly contested, in part because it is based on a partial climate model that focuses on the equatorial Pacific alone. Cane further maintains that the trend over the past century has been towards warmer temperatures in the western Pacific relative to those in the east. That opens the door, he says, to the possibility that warming from greenhouse gases is driving La Niña-like conditions and could continue to do so in the future, helping to suppress global warming. “If all of that is true, it’s a negative feedback, and if we don’t capture it in our models they will overstate the warming,” he says.\n\nThere are two potential holes in his assessment. First, the historical ocean-temperature data are notoriously imprecise, leading many researchers to dispute Cane’s assertion that the equatorial Pacific shifted towards a more La Niña-like state during the past century10. Second, many researchers have found the opposite pattern in simulations with full climate models, which factor in the suite of atmospheric and oceanic interactions beyond the equatorial Pacific. These tend to reveal a trend towards more El Niño-like conditions as a result of global warming. The difference seems to lie, in part, in how warming influences evaporation in areas of the Pacific, according to Trenberth. He says the models suggest that global warming has a greater impact on temperatures in the relatively cool east, because the increase in evaporation adds water vapour to the atmosphere there and enhances atmospheric warming; this effect is weaker in the warmer western Pacific, where the air is already saturated with moisture.\n\nScientists may get to test their theories soon enough. At present, strong tropical trade winds are pushing ever more warm water westward towards Indonesia, fuelling storms such as November’s Typhoon Haiyan, and nudging up sea levels in the western Pacific; they are now roughly 20 centimetres higher than those in the eastern Pacific. Sooner or later, the trend will inevitably reverse. “You can’t keep piling up warm water in the western Pacific,” Trenberth says. “At some point, the water will get so high that it just sloshes back.” And when that happens, if scientists are on the right track, the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again.",

world leaders gathering later that year around a conference table in copenhagen to reach a global agreement are but a distant memory today with many of these same leaders focusing their attention on jumpstarting economic growth environmental issues have taken a back seat for environmentalists it may seem that climate policy has dropped from the political agenda altogether theyre right the worlds biggest emitters have reached a consensus of sorts but not the one hoped for in copenhagen in the united states president barack obama has borrowed his energy policy — all of the above — from the republicans europe has dithered on any further commitments to emissions reductions as governments have been completely consumed by the euro crisis china and india have used the followon conferences to copenhagen held in durban and cancun to decisively push international climate negotiations into the long weeds leaders attention to climate policy is not coming back — at least not in any form comparable to the plans being discussed just a few years ago pielke who is a self described moderate in the climate change debate goes on to say we should concentrate on attainable technologies to reduce our rampant co 2 emissions primarily natural gas he correctly labels carbon capture from coal and gas largescale wind and solar technologically immature and expensive especially when compared to gas lastly he tells the climate change alarmists and greens to forget a mythical high carbon price in todays political climate professor pielke is not alone in his call for more rational analysis of possible climate change impacts lenny smith and arthur petersen have written a very interesting and insightful paper variations on reliability connecting climate predictions to climate policy they question whether the statistical uncertainty adequately captures the relevant dominant uncertainty rdu while the ipcc has led the climate science community in codifying uncertainty characterisation it has paid much less attention to specifying the rdu they state the focus is at times more on ensuring reproducibility of computation than on relevancefidelity to the earths climate system in fact it is not always easy to distinguish which of these two are being discussed barrack obama is still offering lip service to green energy and climate change but he is rapidly becoming a political dinosaur a recent gallup poll shows that in the us climate change is way down on the list of things people are concerned about this is very similar to the survey showing europeans worrying a lot more about almost all issues other than global warming while the climate wars will go on characterized by a poisonous mix dodgy science personal attacks and partisan warfare the good news is that progress can yet be made outside of this battle pielke concludes yes i would say that the tide has changed for climate change and those trying to make political gain from frightening the public with lurid tales of impending ecological doom climate change alarmists will continue to prattle on about ecoapocalypse being just around the corner—just as soon as they can find the missing heat the rest of us can get on

            "text": "The Turning Of The Tide Submitted by Doug L. Hoffman on Tue, 03/25/2014 - 13:52 Supporters of the CO 2 driven theory of anthropogenic global warming (CAGW) are in full panic mode. The continued hiatus in global temperature increase has led to a flurry of statements denying “the pause,” as climate scientists have named it. This new denialism even extends to international organizations like the WHO, that just recently claimed that global warming had not ceased, even though numerous organizations—including Britain’s Meteorological Office, NASA, and the IPCC—have admitted that it has. Among climate change true believers there is a scramble on to “find the missing heat” that would explain the pause. Strangely, among these practitioners of group think there is no consensus about the cause of the pause. At the same time, the IPCC is about to release its latest screed regarding climate change and the leaks have been flowing fast and furious, saying there is dissent in the land of consensus. This may well be the turning of the tide on the greatest scientific hoax in history. The number varies between 15 and 17 years but there is no doubt that the climate change cabal is worried. It seems Earth's temperature is stubbornly refusing to rise according to the demands of their computer models. Do not misunderstand, this is a big thing in climate circles. It could bring into doubt the entire house of cards that is CAGW. Even the Economist, a past cheerleader for the global warming crowd, has been forced to admit that something is rotten in climate science (see “Who pressed the pause button?”): Still, attempts to explain away that stable average have not been convincing, partly because of the conflict between flat temperatures and rising CO 2 emissions, and partly because observed temperatures are now falling outside the range climate models predict. The models embody the state of climate knowledge. If they are wrong, the knowledge is probably faulty, too. Hence attempts to explain the pause. In short, the whole bloody story could be a sham. Many climate change apologists have put forth explanations. In fact, the explanations have come from so many quarters that the Economist has stated: “The slowdown in rising temperatures over the past 15 years goes from being unexplained to overexplained.” Let's review the leading explanations. In September 2013 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) pointed to fluctuating solar output, atmospheric pollution and volcanoes. All three conspired to suppress global warming. Gavin Schmidt and two colleagues at NASA’s Goddard Institute quantify the effects of these trends in Nature Geoscience. They argue that climate models underplay the delayed and subdued solar cycle, and that volcanic activity since 2000 has been greater than previously thought. Here is how Schmidt et al. framed the conundrum in “Reconciling warming trends”: Any divergence between real-world climate phenomena and prior expectations poses interesting science questions. The case of the apparent slow-down of warming since the record El Niño event in 1997/1998 is no exception. The global mean surface temperature trend was smaller1 between 1997 and 2013 (0.07±0.08 °C per decade) than over the last 50 years (0.16 ± 0.02 °C per decade), highlighting questions about the mechanisms that regulate decadal variability in the Earth's temperature. In addition, the warming trend in the most recent 15-year period is near the lower edge of the 5–95% range of projections from a collection of climate models that were part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Why most of the model simulations suggest more warming than has been observed is a second question that deserves further exploration. Tweaking their models for these missing factors can bring the predictions back into line with reality. As I have mentioned many times, you can tune a computer model to give you any output you desire. This is particularly easy after the fact, as Gavin and the GISS boys know. Below are some of the corrections and outputs from their model. “The adjusted ensemble spread (dashed grey) clearly shows the decadal impact of the updated drivers,” the authors claim, adding, “As an aside, we note that although it is convenient to use the CMIP5 ensemble to assess expected spreads in possible trends, the ensemble is not a true probabilistic sample.” Recently, Dr. Judith Curry, Professor and Chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has been shedding light on why climate models are such failable friends to climate scientists. “As temperatures have declined and climate models have failed to predict this decline, the IPCC has gained confidence in catastrophic warming and dismisses the pause as unpredictable climate variability,” she states on her blog. Moreover, “the IPCC does not have a convincing or confident explanation for the current hiatus in warming.” Why? “The stagnation in greenhouse warming observed over the past 15+ years demonstrates that CO 2 is not a control knob on climate variability on decadal time scales,” said Dr. Curry in testimony before the US Senate. The models' over-reliance on carbon dioxide as the primary driver of climate has bitten the hands of those who coded it into their models. As a result, the vast majority of their models failed to predict the pause as shown below. \n\n Pick a model, any model and it will be wrong. Another proposed explanation says the missing heat is hiding in the deep ocean. It is certainly true that Earth's oceans, especially the largest, the Pacific, absorb prodigious amount of heat energy, storing some and transport it around the globe. Several new studies link the pause with changes in the Pacific and the trade winds that influence the circulation of water within it. There are a number of normal, wholly natural cycles that center on the Pacific: the frequent El Niño and La Niña; a long-term cycle called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which switches from a warm to a cool every 20 or 30 years; and a supposedly one-off increase in the strength of the trade winds during the past 20 years. This, according to Kevin Trenberth and John Fasullo of America’s National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), has produced a period of unexpected cooling. “The 1997 to ’98 El Niño event was a trigger for the changes in the Pacific, and I think that’s very probably the beginning of the hiatus,” said Trenberth in a news feature in Nature. According to this theory, the tropical Pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell sometime in the future. “Eventually,” Trenberth says, “it will switch back in the other direction.” Trenberth is not alone in this hypothesis. According to a paper in Nature Climate Change, by Matthew England of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, University of New South Wales, the record trade winds have produced a super La Niña that is causing warm water to pile up at the western end of the Pacific. There it is getting buried by colder water, driving the heat deep into the ocean (see the figure below). This is known as the “the ocean ate my global warming” theory. “[T]he pause has gone from being not explained to explained twice over—once by aerosols and the solar cycle, and again by ocean winds and currents,” the Economist article concludes. “These two accounts are not contradictory. The processes at work are understood, but their relative contributions are not.” This doesn't mean that the UK new magazine or the supporters of CAGW are folding their tents. Indeed, the article concludes with a flippant “like the Terminator, global warming will be back.” The global warming carnival never ends. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will publish their first update in seven years on the scale of the threat. This will be the second of three reports on the causes, effects and solutions to climate change. Leaked documents speak of significant effects on economies, food supplies and security. But some participants in the IPCC process say the summary, due out on March 31, is far too alarmist. An interesting piece on the BBC website, by Environment correspondent Matt McGrath, hints at dissent among the experts assembled by the UN agency to do its bidding. IPCC scientists have distanced themselves from a number of their previous forecasts. Notable among these is the prediction of mass extinctions because of global warming. “There is very little confidence that the current models accurately predict the risk of extinction,” the new report states, contradicting previous IPCC tomes. In the draft report, no concrete numbers are mentioned for postulated extinction of species. “The message in the first draft was that through adaptation and clever development these were manageable risks, but it did require we get our act together,” Prof Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex, who has been the convening lead author of the chapter on economics, told BBC News. “This has completely disappeared from the draft now, which is all about the impacts of climate change and the four horsemen of the apocalypse.” The IPCC opting for scare tactics over rational evaluation? Imagine that. Even the notoriously pro-global warming Met Office says a lot more work must be done to confirm the links that do appear in the report. While the new report is shaping up to be more nuanced, with far more emphasis on adaptation than the last one in 2007, it comes at a time when climate change has fallen off the political radar. Writing in Foreign Policy magazine, Professor Roger Pielke Jr. has hit the nail on the head when it comes to climate change's falling public profile. Here is how his article, “Climate of Failure,” begins: The heady days of early 2009, when advocates for global action on climate change anticipated world leaders gathering later that year around a conference table in Copenhagen to reach a global agreement, are but a distant memory. Today, with many of these same leaders focusing their attention on jumpstarting economic growth, environmental issues have taken a back seat. For environmentalists, it may seem that climate policy has dropped from the political agenda altogether. They're right. The world's biggest emitters have reached a consensus of sorts, but not the one hoped for in Copenhagen. In the United States, President Barack Obama has borrowed his energy policy — “all of the above” — from the Republicans. Europe has dithered on any further commitments to emissions reductions as governments have been completely consumed by the euro crisis. China and India have used the follow-on conferences to Copenhagen, held in Durban and Cancun, to decisively push international climate negotiations into the long weeds. Leaders' attention to climate policy is not coming back — at least not in any form comparable to the plans being discussed just a few years ago. Pielke, who is a self described moderate in the climate change debate, goes on to say we should concentrate on attainable technologies to reduce our rampant CO 2 emissions, primarily Natural Gas. He correctly labels carbon capture from coal and gas, large-scale wind, and solar technologically immature and expensive, especially when compared to gas. Lastly he tells the climate change alarmists and greens to forget a “mythical high carbon price” in today's political climate. Professor Pielke is not alone in his call for more rational analysis of possible climate change impacts. Lenny Smith and Arthur Petersen have written a very interesting and insightful paper “Variations on Reliability: Connecting Climate Predictions to Climate Policy.” They question whether the statistical uncertainty adequately captures the relevant dominant uncertainty (RDU). “While the IPCC has led the climate science community in codifying uncertainty characterisation, it has paid much less attention to specifying the RDU,” they state. “The focus is at times more on ensuring reproducibility of computation than on relevance(fidelity) to the Earth’s climate system, in fact it is not always easy to distinguish which of these two are being discussed.” Barrack Obama is still offering lip service to green energy and climate change but he is rapidly becoming a political dinosaur. A recent Gallup poll shows that in the US climate change is way down on the list of things people are concerned about. This is very similar to the survey showing Europeans worrying a lot more about almost all issues other than global warming. “While the climate wars will go on, characterized by a poisonous mix dodgy science, personal attacks, and partisan warfare, the good news is that progress can yet be made outside of this battle,” Pielke concludes. Yes, I would say that the tide has changed for climate change and those trying to make political gain from frightening the public with lurid tales of impending ecological doom. Climate change alarmists will continue to prattle on about eco-apocalypse being just around the corner—just as soon as they can find the missing heat. The rest of us can get on with our lives, reassured by the knowledge that climate science hasn't a clue about what will happen in the future. Be safe, enjoy the interglacial and stay skeptical.",

about the same time that don easterbrooks post cause of the pause in global warming was published at wattsupwiththat this post includes an overview of the mistakes people make when they attempt to use the pacific decadal oscillation data as a metric for the dominant mode of variability in the pacific ocean so it contradicts easterbrooks post more detailed discussions of what the pdo data represents and what it doesnt represent can be found in the posts here here and here if you for some reason would like to argue about it on this thread please see my comments on the easterbrook thread starting here the nature article climate change the case of the missing heat by jeff tollefson has received a lot of attention at wattsupwiththat and around the blogosphere much of tollefsons article was a simplified explanation of the findings of trenberth and fasullo 2013 an apparent hiatus in global warming weve discussed that paper already see the posts trenberth and fasullo try to keep the fantasy alive and more on trenberth and fasullo 2013 an apparent hiatus in global warming anthony watts was right to call attention to tollefsons article it presented an argument and illustration that had been presented years ago by skeptics an argument and illustration that had been dismissed by global warming enthusiasts and tollefson is linking it to trenberth and fasullo one point needs to be made right from the get go as far as i could tell no one interviewed for the nature article claimed the hiatus in surface warming was not happening that article is an attempt to explain the growing differences between the model simulations and measured global average surface temperatures and the more i look at it tollefson appears a bit skeptical at times one problem with tollefsons article it only discusses the hiatus in surface temperature warming it does not address the absence of warming of the pacific ocean and north atlantic to depths of 2000 meters for the period of 2003 to 2012 see figure 1 only the south atlantic and indian oceans show warming to depth figure 1 is from the post here figure 1 manmade greenhouse gases can not select which ocean basins they decide to warm and the tollefson article unfortunately offers as much misinformation as information the first problem as noted above was the article does not address the missing heat in the depths of the pacific over the last decade and that is where the heat would have to be appearing if trenberth and fasullo 2013 were correct the second problem has to do with using pacific decadal oscillation pdo data as a metric for the strength frequency and duration of el niño and la niña events its the wrong dataset el niño and la niña events are the primary focus of the article tollefson acknowledges this with his statement and here the spotlight falls on the equatorial pacific but then he presents pacific decadal oscillation pdo data as the metric for el niños and la niñas hes likely taking his cue from trenberth and fasullo 2013 for that el niño and la niña events take place in the tropical pacific but the pacific decadal oscillation dataset is an abstract form of sea surface temperature data derived from the extratropical north pacific not the tropical pacific see figure 2 figure 2 the pdo data basically represent how closely the spatial pattern of the sea surface temperature anomalies of the north pacific north of 20n resembles the pattern created by enso events where the spatial patterns are warmer in the east and cooler in the central and western north pacific during el niños and cooler in the east and warmer in the central and western north pacific during la niñas because that spatial pattern of sea surface temperatures in the north pacific is also impacted by sea level pressures and their interrelated wind patterns the pacific decadal oscillation data are not a true representation of the frequency magnitude and duration of el niño and la niña events for more information about what the pdo represents and more importantly what it doesnt represent see the posts here here and here figure 3 the big surprise in the nature article was the illustration comparing the pacific decadal oscillation pdo data with the global surface temperatures titled the pacifics global reach ive included it as my figure 3 it compares the jisao pdo data to global surface temperature anomalies the text in the illustration clearly states during periods when the pdo index is positive and the eastern pacific is warm global temperatures have risen quickly during spells when the pdo index is negative the warming has stagnated additionally with respect to the illustration the article reads an analysis of historical data buttressed these conclusions showing that the cool phase of the pdo coincided with a few decades of cooler temperatures after the second world war see the pacifics global reach and that the warm phase lined up with the sharp spike seen in global temperatures between 1976 and 1998 ref 4 this of course strongly suggests that the warm phase of the pdo is responsible for part of the warming during the period from 1976 to 1998 if the pdo can stop the warming then the pdo had to have contributed to the warming that had been a skeptical argument for years i can recall seeing similar graphs more than 5 years ago in fact it was so popular skepticalscience wrote a post about it here back in 2008 unfortunately there are no mechanisms through which the pdo as defined by the jisao dataset can cause global surface temperatures to vary the sea surface temperatures of the north pacific north of 20n are inversely related to the pdo data those mechanisms exist in the tropical pacific and portray themselves as el niños and la niñas sea surface temperaturebased indices for the strength frequency and duration of el niños and la niñas do exist in fact trenberth and stepaniak 2001 indices of el niño evolution online edition here recommended using the sea surface temperature anomalies of the nino34 region of the equatorial pacific identified as n34 in the paper see the illustration here for the location of the nino34 region trenberth and stepaniak 2001 used the hadisst dataset with the base years of 19501979 for anomalies unfortunately trenberth and stepaniak never really provided a scientific justification for using the base years of 1950 to 1979 so we would be better off using the entire term of the data 1923 to 2013 as the base years for the nino34 sea surface temperature anomalies the nino34 sea surface temperature data are realistic index for strength frequency and duration of el niño and la niña events so lets look at the average nino34 sea surface temperature anomalies for the two warming periods and the two hiatus periods see figure 4 well use the periods defined by trenberth and fasullo 2013 the monthly time series figure 8 readily reveals the multidecadal regimes of the pdo given by the black line with positive phases from 1923 to 1942 and 1976 to 1998 and negative phases from 1943 to 1976 and after 1999 curiously the periods presented by trenberth and fasullo 2013 do not agree with those presented by tollefson in his the pacifics global reach illustration that aside my figure 4 shows that during the two warming periods of 1923 to 1942 and 1976 to 1998 the average sea surface temperature anomalies for the nino34 region were well above zero this means that el niño events dominated that period global surface temperatures should warm during those periods because the tropical pacific is releasing more heat than normal from the tropical pacific and redistributing more warm water than normal to adjacent ocean basins and during the two hiatus periods of 1943 to 1976 and 1999 to present the average nino34 sea surface temperature anomalies are below zero that of course means the tropical pacific is releasing less heat than normal and redistributing less warm water than normal to adjacent ocean basins and during those periods global surface temperatures flattened or cooled slightly figure 4 you may be asking yourself why did bob go through that exercise when it basically showed the same results as tollefsons pdo graph the nino34 data are the correct dataset to use and the pdo is not the pdo does not represent the timing strength and duration of el niño and la niña events it portrays an aftereffect of el niño and la niña events combined with the influence of the sea level pressure of the north pacific but now we have to consider that the nino34 sea surface data only capture the effects of enso on a small region of the equatorial pacific they do not represent the processes of enso or their aftereffects and in no way can nino34 sea surface temperature anomalies account for the warm water that is left over from strong el niño events which is redistributed to adjacent ocean basins in their wakes more misinformation the article states my boldface just before the hiatus took hold that region had turned unusually warm during the el niño of 1997–98 which fuelled extreme weather across the planet from floods in chile and califor­nia to droughts and wildfires in mexico and indonesia but it ended just as quickly as it had begun and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of el niños sister effect la niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial pacific with a vengeance more importantly the entire eastern pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day entire eastern pacific the pdo data do not represent the entire eastern pacific if hes thinking sea surface temperature anomalies thats also wrong there have been a number of el niño events since 1999 those el niño events occurred in 200203and 200405and 200607and 200910 as a result the average sea surface temperature anomalies of the east pacific using noaas standard base years 19712000 for their reynolds oiv2 data for the period of january 1999 to december 2013 are 006 deg c and thats a far cry from a cool state that has continued more or less to this day see figure 5 figure 5 model nonsense the article reads second many researchers have found the opposite pattern in simulations with full cli­mate models which factor in the suite of atmospheric and oceanic interac­tions beyond the equatorial pacific these tend to reveal a trend towards more el niñolike conditions as a result of global warming climate models dont simulate enso properly so this is irrelevant see guilyardi et al 2009 understanding el niño in oceanatmosphere general circulation models progress and challenges and bellenger et al 2013 enso representation in climate models from cmip3 to cmip5 preprint copy is here things overlooked the following was written for the post comments on stefan rahmstorfs post at realclimate what ocean heating reveals about global warming the discussion applies here as well ive changed the figure numbers and made a few minor revisions for this post in the lefthand graph of figure 6 we can see that the sea surface temperatures of the east pacific have warmed little if at all over nearly the past 32 yearssince the start of the reynolds oiv2 sea surface temperature dataset in november 1981 the east pacific 90s90n 18080w covers about 33 of the surface of the global oceans the papers presented by jeff tollefson do not address this lack of warming and climate models do not simulate it figure 6 the same hold true for whats illustrated in the righthand graph and they are the sea surface temperature anomalies of the south atlantic indian and west pacific oceans the coordinates are listed in the title block they cover more than 50 of the surface of the global oceans we can see a number of things in the sea surface temperature data for the south atlantic indian and west pacific oceans 1 their longterm warming depends on the el niño events of 19868788 and 199798 and possibly the el niño of 200910 2 they do not cool proportionally during the transition to the trailing la niñas of 198889 and 199801 but 3 they do cool slightly over the decadelong periods between the el niño events of 19868788 and 199798 and between the 199798 and 200910 el niños for an introductory discussion of the natural warming of the global oceans refer to the illustrated essay the manmade global warming challenge 42mb the sea surface temperatures of the north atlantic are governed by another mode of natural variability called the atlantic multidecadal oscillation or amo which has been overlooked by jeff tollefson the amo is the reason why the sea surface temperatures there warmed at a much higher rate than the rest of the global oceans from the mid1970s to the early2000s but the sea surface temperature data for the north atlantic indicate the amo may have already peaked see figure 7 if history repeats itself and there is no reason to believe it will not then the sea surface temperatures of the north atlantic will show no warming and actually cool for a few more decades assuming the atlantic multidecadal oscillation has in fact peaked figure 7 note for further information about the atlantic multidecadal oscillation see noaas aoml atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory frequently asked questions webpage here and my blog post here and my introduction to the atlantic multidecadal oscillation here closing the article by jeff tollefson suggests the climate science community may be moving in the right direction—thats a big may be but theyll have to return to basics enso is fueled by sunlight and for that reference as ive presented numerous times before we have trenberth et al 2002 evolution of el niño–southern oscillation and global atmospheric surface temperatures the negative feedback between sst and surface fluxes can be interpreted as showing the importance of the discharge of heat during el niño events and of the recharge of heat during la niña events relatively clear skies in the central and eastern tropical pacific allow solar radiation to enter the ocean apparently offsetting the below normal ssts but the heat is carried away by ekman drift ocean currents and adjustments through ocean rossby and kelvin waves and the heat is stored in the western pacific tropics this is not simply a rearrangement of the ocean heat but also a restoration of heat in the ocean in other words the stronger trade winds reduce cloud cover which in turn allows more sunlight to warm the tropical pacific so if the stronger trade winds are causing more warm water to be stacked up in the western tropical pacific its an increase in sunlight thats fueling it this was discussed in much more detail under the heading of downward shortwave radiation versus downward longwave radiation during la niña events in the post open letter to the royal meteorological society regarding dr trenberths article has global warming stalled like this like loading

            "text": "UPDATE: I finished writing this post and published it at my blog Climate Observations about the same time that Don Easterbrook’s post Cause of ‘the pause’ in global warming was published at WattsUpWithThat.\n\nThis post includes an overview of the mistakes people make when they attempt to use the Pacific Decadal Oscillation data as a metric for the dominant mode of variability in the Pacific Ocean. So it contradicts Easterbrook’s post. More detailed discussions of what the PDO data represents and what it doesn’t represent can be found in the posts here, here and here. If you for some reason would like to argue about it on this thread, please see my comments on the Easterbrook thread starting here.\n\n# # #\n\nThe Nature article Climate Change: The Case of the Missing Heat by Jeff Tollefson has received a lot of attention at WattsUpWithThat and around the blogosphere. Much of Tollefson’s article was a simplified explanation of the findings of Trenberth and Fasullo (2013) An apparent hiatus in global warming? We’ve discussed that paper already. See the posts Trenberth and Fasullo Try to Keep the Fantasy Alive and More on Trenberth and Fasullo (2013) “An Apparent Hiatus in Global Warming?”\n\nAnthony Watts was right to call attention to Tollefson’s article; it presented an argument and illustration that had been presented years ago by skeptics, an argument and illustration that had been dismissed by global warming enthusiasts. And Tollefson is linking it to Trenberth and Fasullo.\n\nOne point needs to be made right from the get go. As far as I could tell, no one interviewed for the Nature article claimed the hiatus in surface warming was not happening. That article is an attempt to explain the growing differences between the model simulations and measured global average surface temperatures. And the more I look at it, Tollefson appears a bit skeptical at times.\n\nOne problem with Tollefson’s article: it only discusses the hiatus in surface temperature warming. It does not address the absence of warming of the Pacific Ocean and North Atlantic to depths of 2000 meters, for the period of 2003 to 2012. See Figure 1. Only the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans show warming to depth. Figure 1 is from the post here.\n\nFigure 1\n\nManmade greenhouse gases cannot select which ocean basins they decide to warm.\n\nAnd the Tollefson article, unfortunately, offers as much misinformation as information.\n\nThe first problem, as noted above, was the article does not address the “missing heat” in the depths of the Pacific over the last decade, and that is where the heat would have to be appearing if Trenberth and Fasullo (2013) were correct.\n\nThe second problem has to do with using Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) data as a metric for the strength, frequency and duration of El Niño and La Niña events. It’s the wrong dataset.\n\nEl Niño and La Niña events are the primary focus of the article. Tollefson acknowledges this with his statement:\n\nBut then he presents Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) data as the metric for El Niños and La Niñas. He’s likely taking his cue from Trenberth and Fasullo (2013) for that.\n\nEl Niño and La Niña events take place in the tropical Pacific, but the Pacific Decadal Oscillation dataset is an abstract form of sea surface temperature data derived from the extratropical North Pacific, not the tropical Pacific. See Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2\n\nThe PDO data basically represent how closely the spatial pattern of the sea surface temperature anomalies of the North Pacific (north of 20N) resembles the pattern created by ENSO events (where the spatial patterns are warmer in the east and cooler in the central and western North Pacific during El Niños, and cooler in the east and warmer in the central and western North Pacific during La Niñas). Because that spatial pattern of sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific is also impacted by sea level pressures (and their interrelated wind patterns), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation data are not a true representation of the frequency, magnitude and duration of El Niño and La Niña events.\n\nFor more information about what the PDO represents, and more importantly what it doesn’t represent, see the posts here, here and here.\n\nFigure 3\n\nThe big surprise in the Nature article was the illustration comparing the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) data with the global surface temperatures titled “The Pacific’s Global Reach”. I’ve included it as my Figure 3. It compares the JISAO PDO data to global surface temperature anomalies. The text in the illustration clearly states:\n\nAdditionally, with respect to the illustration, the article reads:\n\nThis, of course, strongly suggests that the warm phase of the PDO is responsible for part of the warming during the period from 1976 to 1998. If the PDO can stop the warming, then the PDO had to have contributed to the warming. That had been a skeptical argument for years. I can recall seeing similar graphs more than 5 years ago. In fact, it was so popular SkepticalScience wrote a post about it here back in 2008.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no mechanisms through which the PDO (as defined by the JISAO dataset) can cause global surface temperatures to vary. The sea surface temperatures of the North Pacific north of 20N are inversely related to the PDO data.\n\nThose mechanisms exist in the tropical Pacific and portray themselves as El Niños and La Niñas. Sea surface temperature-based indices for the strength, frequency and duration of El Niños and La Niñas do exist. In fact, Trenberth and Stepaniak (2001) Indices of El Niño Evolution (online edition here) recommended using the sea surface temperature anomalies of the NINO3.4 region of the equatorial Pacific (identified as N3.4 in the paper). See the illustration here for the location of the NINO3.4 region. Trenberth and Stepaniak (2001) used the HADISST dataset, with the base years of 1950-1979 for anomalies. Unfortunately, Trenberth and Stepaniak never really provided a scientific justification for using the base years of 1950 to 1979. So we would be better off using the entire term of the data (1923 to 2013) as the base years for the NINO3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies.\n\nThe NINO3.4 sea surface temperature data are realistic index for strength, frequency and duration of El Niño and La Niña events. So let’s look at the average NINO3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies for the two warming periods and the two hiatus periods. See Figure 4. We’ll use the periods defined by Trenberth and Fasullo (2013):\n\nCuriously, the periods presented by Trenberth and Fasullo (2013) do not agree with those presented by Tollefson in his “The Pacific’s Global Reach” illustration. That aside, my Figure 4 shows that during the two warming periods of 1923 to 1942 and 1976 to 1998, the average sea surface temperature anomalies for the NINO3.4 region were well above zero. This means that El Niño events dominated that period. Global surface temperatures should warm during those periods because the tropical Pacific is releasing more heat than “normal” from the tropical Pacific and redistributing more warm water than “normal” to adjacent ocean basins. And during the two hiatus periods of 1943 to 1976 and 1999 to present, the average NINO3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies are below zero. That of course means the tropical Pacific is releasing less heat than “normal” and redistributing less warm water than “normal” to adjacent ocean basins. And during those periods global surface temperatures flattened or cooled slightly.\n\nFigure 4\n\nYou may be asking yourself, why did Bob go through that exercise when it basically showed the same results as Tollefson’s PDO graph?\n\nThe NINO3.4 data are the correct dataset to use and the PDO is not. The PDO does not represent the timing, strength and duration of El Niño and La Niña events. It portrays an aftereffect of El Niño and La Niña events, combined with the influence of the sea level pressure of the North Pacific.\n\nBut now we have to consider that the NINO3.4 sea surface data only capture the effects of ENSO on a small region of the equatorial Pacific. They do not represent the processes of ENSO or their aftereffects. And in no way can NINO3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies account for the warm water that is left over from strong El Niño events, which is redistributed to adjacent ocean basins in their wakes.\n\nMORE MISINFORMATION\n\nThe article states (my boldface):\n\nEntire eastern Pacific? The PDO data do not represent the “entire eastern Pacific”. If he’s thinking sea surface temperature anomalies, that’s also wrong. There have been a number of El Niño events since 1999. Those El Niño events occurred in 2002/03…and 2004/05…and 2006/07…and 2009/10. As a result, the average sea surface temperature anomalies [of the East Pacific], using NOAA’s standard base years 1971-2000 for their Reynolds OI.v2 data, for the period of January 1999 to December 2013 are +0.06 deg C, and that’s a far cry from “a cool state that has continued more or less to this day.” See Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5\n\nMODEL NONSENSE\n\nThe article reads:\n\nClimate models don’t simulate ENSO properly, so this is irrelevant. See Guilyardi, et al. (2009) “Understanding El Niño in Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Models: Progress and Challenges” and Bellenger, et al. (2013): “ENSO Representation in Climate Models: From CMIP3 to CMIP5.” Preprint copy is here.\n\nTHINGS OVERLOOKED\n\nThe following was written for the post Comments on Stefan Rahmstorf’s Post at RealClimate “What ocean heating reveals about global warming”. The discussion applies here as well. I’ve changed the Figure numbers and made a few minor revisions for this post.\n\nIn the left-hand graph of Figure 6, we can see that the sea surface temperatures of the East Pacific have warmed little, if at all, over nearly the past 32 years…since the start of the Reynolds OI.v2 sea surface temperature dataset in November 1981. The East Pacific (90S-90N, 180-80W) covers about 33% of the surface of the global oceans. The papers presented by Jeff Tollefson do not address this lack of warming and climate models do not simulate it.\n\nFigure 6\n\nThe same hold true for what’s illustrated in the right-hand graph, and they are the sea surface temperature anomalies of the South Atlantic, Indian and West Pacific oceans. The coordinates are listed in the title block. They cover more than 50% of the surface of the global oceans. We can see a number of things in the sea surface temperature data for the South Atlantic, Indian and West Pacific oceans: (1) their long-term warming depends on the El Niño events of 1986/87/88 and 1997/98 (and possibly the El Niño of 2009/10); (2) they do not cool proportionally during the transition to the trailing La Niñas of 1988/89 and 1998-01; but (3) they do cool slightly over the decade-long periods between the El Niño events of 1986/87/88 and 1997/98 and between the 1997/98 and 2009/10 El Niños.\n\nFor an introductory discussion of the natural warming of the global oceans refer to the illustrated essay “The Manmade Global Warming Challenge” (42MB).\n\nThe sea surface temperatures of the North Atlantic are governed by another mode of natural variability called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation or AMO, which has been overlooked by Jeff Tollefson. The AMO is the reason why the sea surface temperatures there warmed at a much higher rate than the rest of the global oceans from the mid-1970s to the early-2000s. But the sea surface temperature data for the North Atlantic indicate the AMO may have already peaked. See Figure 7. If history repeats itself, and there is no reason to believe it will not, then the sea surface temperatures of the North Atlantic will show no warming and actually cool for a few more decades, assuming the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation has, in fact, peaked.\n\nFigure 7\n\nNote: For further information about the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, see NOAA’s AOML (Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory) Frequently Asked Questions webpage here, and my blog post here and my introduction to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation here.\n\nCLOSING\n\nThe article by Jeff Tollefson suggests the climate science community may be moving in the right direction—that’s a big MAY BE.\n\nBut they’ll have to return to basics: ENSO is fueled by sunlight. And for that reference, as I’ve presented numerous times before, we have Trenberth et al. (2002) Evolution of El Niño–Southern Oscillation and global atmospheric surface temperatures:\n\nIn other words, the stronger trade winds reduce cloud cover, which, in turn, allows more sunlight to warm the tropical Pacific. So, if the stronger trade winds are causing more warm water to be stacked up in the western tropical Pacific, it’s an increase in sunlight that’s fueling it. This was discussed in much more detail under the heading of DOWNWARD SHORTWAVE RADIATION VERSUS DOWNWARD LONGWAVE RADIATION DURING LA NIÑA EVENTS in the post Open Letter to the Royal Meteorological Society Regarding Dr. Trenberth’s Article “Has Global Warming Stalled?”",

[open access]\n\nThe eminent science journal Nature has finally acknowledged that global average temperatures have not behaved as predicted by climate models over the last 16 years. [h/t A. Watts]\n\nNote that predictions of future sea ice declines and associated predictions of future polar bear declines are totally dependent on these climate models.\n\nHere’s my question: if global temperatures have basically flat-lined since 1998, why has Arctic sea ice continued to decline?\n\nIf average global temperatures govern Arctic sea ice behavior, why was 1998 (or the year after) not the lowest September sea ice extent reached over the last 30 years? Oddly, 2012 was the lowest September extent (see graphs below, from NSIDC).\n\nParadoxically, not only has sea ice continued to decline since 1998 – despite the hiatus in global warming – but since 1998, all but one polar bear populations have either increased in size, not declined, or are doing very well by other measures (see previous summary post, “Polar bears have not been harmed by sea ice declines“).\n\n\n\n In the graphic that accompanied the Tollefson article (below), note the cool Arctic Ocean temperatures associated with the “cold” phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO):\n\nHere are some more quotes from the Tollefson article:\n\n“The biggest mystery in climate science today may have begun, unbeknownst to anybody at the time, with a subtle weakening of the tropical trade winds blowing across the Pacific Ocean in late 1997.

Climate scientists, meanwhile, know that heat must still be building up somewhere in the climate system, but they have struggled to explain where it is going, if not into the atmosphere.\n\n Some have begun to wonder whether there is something amiss in their models.\n\nNow, as the global-warming hiatus enters its sixteenth year, scientists are at last making headway in the case of the missing heat. Some have pointed to the Sun, volcanoes and even pollution from China as potential culprits, but recent studies suggest that the oceans are key to explaining the anomaly. The latest suspect is the El Niño of 1997–98, which pumped prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere — perhaps enough to tip the equatorial Pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since.\n\n“The 1997 to ’98 El Niño event was a trigger for the changes in the Pacific, and I think that’s very probably the beginning of the hiatus,” says Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado.

thus disproving ehrlichs claim that population growth would produce an increase in scarcity ehrlich eagerly accepted working with likeminded scientists he selected chromium copper nickel tin and tungsten in the 1970s the market prices of all five had increased significantly at least in nominal terms ehrlich was confident that as a result of population growth the trend would continue but simon won the bet and it wasnt even close by 1990 the prices of each metal had decreased by an average of 50 percent even though the decade had seen the largest global population growth in history with 800 million additional people to all appearances simon had been vindicated as sabin explains it turns out that simon was a lucky winner not long ago economists ran a series of simulations for every 10year period from 1900 to 2008 they found that with respect to the prices of the five metals on which ehrlich and simon bet ehrlich would have won 63 percent of the time but this doesnt mean that ehrlich was right because of macroeconomic factors commodity prices are volatile and they are a poor proxy for the effects of population increases these decisions raise diverse questions and each of them must

confronted by rising energy costs and international competition the european unions executive body has recommended relaxing rules on renewable energy with a plan that doesnt hold specific nations responsible for specific targets the eus member states and parliament should reject it the eu has been the leader on fighting climate change if it shies away from its commitment now similar efforts in the us and around the world will almost surely suffer on a positive note the recommendations call for creating an overall target of a 40 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with what they were in 1990 its a worthy target though environmentalists would like it to be even higher the 28nation bloc has reduced such emissions by 12 so far by 2030 the eu is supposed to get more than a quarter of its energy from renewable sources but the plan would eliminate binding agreements under which each member nation would have to meet certain targets so which nations would be responsible for attaining the 2030 goal and how would they be held to it thats unclear in addition the plan would loosen environmental regulations on hydraulic fracturing or fracking for natural gas

percent said global warming is occurring and is caused mostly by humans – which is itself a far cry from having 52 percent say humans are causing a global warming crisis the results were a huge blow to the mythical notion that all or nearly all scientists agree that humans are causing a global warming crisis this is especially the case considering the ams survey reflected the views of scientists

consensus on humancaused global warming to get to the truth i emailed a sample of scientists whose papers were used in the study and asked them if the categorization by cook et al 2013 is an accurate

AEI has an informative piece on economic mobility in the United States: How’s the American Dream doing? Well, which one?\n\nThere are two ways to define economic mobility: 1) absolute mobility, whether each generation is financially better off than the one before; and 2) relative mobility, whether you can change your income rank  vs. your parents. Most Americans probably think both measures important. We want to be more prosperous than mom and dad, but also be able to change our circumstances and make our dreams come true. ...\n\n... A San Francisco Fed study – using data tracking families since 1968 — looks at both versions of the American Dream, finding one healthier than the other. Looking at absolute mobility, researchers Leila Bengali and Mary Daly find the United States “highly mobile.” Over the sample period, 67% of US adults had higher family incomes than their parents, including 83% of those in the lowest birth quintile, or bottom 20% (versus 54% for children born into the top quintile, or top 20%.) ...\n\n3.

Clive Crook thinks an ownership society may be the answer to reducing wealth inequality: Liberals Should Embrace the Ownership Society\n\n... It’s true that conservatives’ standard proposals for privatizing Social Security and voucherizing Medicare would shift risk onto beneficiaries -- but this plainly isn’t a necessary consequence of the basic principle. I agree with Konczal that adequate insurance against economic risk, underwritten by the government, is essential. I also agree that most conservatives aren’t interested in providing that guarantee. That’s exactly why liberals ought to take up the ownership society themselves.\n\nOwnership entails risk, it’s true, but insurance can minimize it. Ownership also provides control, independence and self-respect -- things it wouldn’t hurt liberals to be more interested in. And when it comes to inequality and stagnating middle incomes, ownership can give wage slaves a stake in the nation’s economic capital.\n\nDone right, an equity component in government-backed saving for retirement could be the best idea liberals have had since the earned-income tax credit (oh, sorry, that started out as a conservative idea as well). ...\n\n5.

Store operation will only require 200,000 kWh, so perhaps that extra wattage could be pumped back into the grid or used to power nearby utilities.\n\n9.

Now, we may be more concerned with what someone isn't rather than what they are. And as that twenty-something entrepreneur reminded me over coffee, services like OkCupid, and even Facebook, sap a lot of the mystique out of those first few dates.

Michael Bird offer this quote from Michael Goheen and Craig Bartholomew's \"The Drama of Scripture\" in his post The Importance of the Narrative of Scripture.\n\nMany of us have read the Bible as if it were merely a mosaic of little bits – theological bits, moral bits, historical-critical bits, sermon bits, devotional bits. But when we read the Bible in such a fragmented way, we ignore it’s divine author’s intention to shape our lives through its story. All humanity communities live out some story that provides a context for understanding the meaning of history and gives shape and direction to their lives. If we allow the Bible to become fragmented, it is in danger of being absorbed into whatever other story is shaping our culture, and it will thus cease to shape our lives as it should. Idolatry has twisted the dominant cultural story of the secular Western world. If as believers we allow this story (rather than the Bible) to become the foundation of our thought and action, then our lives will manifest not the truths of Scripture, but the lies of an idolatrous culture. Hence the unity of Scripture is no minor matter: a fragmented Bible may actually produce theologically orthodox, morally upright, warmly pious idol worshippers! (p. 12).\n\n13.

            "text": "The Australian Science Media Centre was swift in canvasing comments about the announcement that 2013 was between the 4th and 7th warmest year in the NASA and NOAA global temperature databases. It also published a number of comments about the so-called “pause” in global temperature data for the past 17 years.\n\nEmeritus Professor Ian Lowe, professor of science, technology and society at Griffith University, Queensland and President of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said:\n\n“The NOAA report confirms at a global scale what we know from Australian Bureau of Meteorology data released recently: the world is getting steadily warmer. While some media outlets are repeating the myth spread by deniers that there has been a pause in warming, the NOAA data confirm that the trend of global warming is continuing. It also confirms that we are seeing more extremes of weather, as the science has been warning us to expect for 25 years. This is further evidence that our governments need to pay attention to the science rather than uninformed self-appointed critics, and take concerted action, both to reduce our domestic production of greenhouse gases and to halt the disastrous proposals to expand fossil fuel exports.”\n\nOh dear! The ‘pause’ is a ‘myth’ spread by deniers. Never mind the increasing number of peer-reviewed papers testifying to its reality, its significance and its interpretation. Last week’s Nature which, following in the footsteps of many media outlets, considers the ‘pause’ to be the biggest problem in climate science, quoted Gabriel Vecchi, a climate scientist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey: “A few years ago you saw the hiatus, but it could be dismissed because it was well within the noise. Now it’s something to explain.”\n\nWhat Professor Lowe is doing is calling science journals and climate scientists “deniers” just for pointing out the evident lack of a warming trend.\n\n1998 And All That\n\nThe Australian Science Media Centre also posted the comments of Professor John Quiggin, an Australian Research Council Laureate Fellow in the School of Economics at the University of Queensland and a member of the Climate Change Authority\n\n“The NOAA has reported, yet again, evidence on the continuing upward trend in global temperatures. The safest prediction that can be made with respect to this news is that it will do nothing to change the actual or ostensible opinions of self-described “sceptics”, most of whom will continue to think that the occurrence of a single relatively hot year (1998) in the late 20th century implies that global warming has “stopped” or “paused” in the 21st century.”\n\nOnce again we have the 1998 argument that was dismissed a long time ago. Nobody credible, or indeed competent, would start global temperature analysis at 1998, which was the peak of the most intense El Nino event in at least a century. Nobody competent in time series statistics would make such a simple mistake. But this is exactly the mistake Professor Quiggin makes. He continues,\n\n“Only someone completely ignorant of time series statistics could make such a claim. Sadly, such people are numerous, and determine the positions adopted by sections of the media and some members of the current government, as well as of conservative political parties in most English speaking countries and elsewhere. In these circumstances, there is little chance that effective action will be taken to stabilise the global climate before it is too late.”\n\nThe Australian Science Media Centre quotes two other climate scientists but they only describe the temperature data.\n\nThis is not an even-handed press release reflecting the views of the climate community on the “pause”, but a biased selection, out of date and lacking in real analysis. To my mind it is a small example that shows that climate dismissal is not confined to so-called ‘sceptics’ but is present in the climate science community as well. When climate scientists start to publically imply that other climate scientists are deniers then it’s time to stop and reflect.\n\nThe so-called ‘pause’ is the most talked about problem in climate science, and it was so-called “sceptics” who first drew attention to it.\n\nThe history of science shows us that sometimes sceptics are right and move from the fringe to the mainstream. It also tells us that some travel in the opposite direction.\n\nThe “pause” is something to be explained, and not dismissed as a “myth.” It is perhaps no surprise that climate scientists are at different stages in their study of its significance and importance. Sadly it is also unsurprising that some media outlets chose to concentrate on only one strand of opinion concerning it.\n\nFeedback: david.whitehouse@thegwpf.com",

            "text": "It is obvious that the source of all heat is the Sun and that nuclear reactions in the earth’s interiror producing heat – if any – are negligible in comparison.\n\nIt seems equally obvious, considering the relative heat capacities of air with that of water, that the primary vehicle for the storage and distribution of the heat emanating from the sun, around the earth, is first by the oceans and only second via the atmosphere. The heat absorbed is attenuated by clouds. The heat lost from the earth is also primarily attenuated by clouds and only marginally by other constituents of the atmosphere.\n\nBut climate models have generally minimised solar insolation effects and largely ignored the oceans. Heat losses have been predicated primarily on carbon dioxide and other trace constituents of the atmosphere and have ended up treating the net effects of clouds as causing warming rather than cooling. Whither common sense!!\n\nBut the current “hiatus” in global warming – which may well become 2 or 3 decades of cooling  – is beginning to bring a whiff of reality into the “science”. They don’t acknowledge the possibility of cooling, of course, and don’t give up on their carbon dioxide fantasies but they are beginning to pay some attention to the oceans and the Sun.\n\nBut now they reckon models must be judged on a timescale of 50 – 100 years!\n\nBut note the phrase “sceptics and some scientists”! I thought scientists were supposed to be sceptical. Science based on belief leaves a little to be desired.\n\nThe heat is actually non-existent but the euphemism for that is “missing heat”.\n\nClimate change: The case of the missing heat Nature 505, 276–278 (16 January 2014),   doi :10.1038/505276a … Average global temperatures hit a record high in 1998 — and then the warming stalled. For several years, scientists wrote off the stall as noise in the climate system: the natural variations in the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere that drive warm or cool spells around the globe. But the pause has persisted, sparking a minor crisis of confidence in the field. Although there have been jumps and dips, average atmospheric temperatures have risen little since 1998, in seeming defiance of projections of climate models and the ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. Climate sceptics have seized on the temperature trends as evidence that global warming has ground to a halt. Climate scientists, meanwhile, know that heat must still be building up somewhere in the climate system, but they have struggled to explain where it is going, if not into the atmosphere. Some have begun to wonder whether there is something amiss in their models. Now, as the global-warming hiatus enters its sixteenth year, scientists are at last making headway in the case of the missing heat. Some have pointed to the Sun, volcanoes and even pollution from China as potential culprits, but recent studies suggest that the oceans are key to explaining the anomaly. The latest suspect is the El Niño of 1997–98, which pumped prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere — perhaps enough to tip the equatorial Pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since. ……  ….. But none of the climate simulations carried out for the IPCC produced this particular hiatus at this particular time. That has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases, and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared. Others say that this conclusion goes against the long-term temperature trends, as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past. And many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively short-term blip in the climate. “If you are interested in global climate change, your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years,” says Susan Solomon, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. …….\n\nTags: carbon dioxide, climate change, effect of oceans, global warming, Nature\n\nThis entry was posted on January 16, 2014 at 2:05 pm and is filed under Alarmism, Climate.

probably the beginning of the hiatus says kevin trenberth a climate scientist at the national center for atmospheric research ncar in boulder colorado according to this theory the tropical pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming yearseventually trenberth says it will switch back in the other direction stark contrast on a chart of global atmospheric temperatures the hiatus stands in stark contrast to the rapid warming of the two decades that preceded it simulations conducted in advance of the 2013–14 assessment from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc suggest that the warming should have continued at an average rate of 021 °c per decade from 1998 to 2012 instead the observed warming during that period was just 004 °c per decade as measured by the uk met office in exeter and the climatic research unit at the university of east anglia in norwich uk the simplest explanation for both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the models is natural variability much like the swings between warm and cold in daytoday weather chaotic climate fluctuations can knock global temperatures up or down from year to year and decade to decade records of past

climate if you are interested in global climate change your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years says susan solomon a climate scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge but even those scientists who remain confident in the underlying models acknowledge that there is increasing pressure to work out just what is happening today a few years ago you saw the hiatus but it could be dismissed because it was well within the noise says gabriel vecchi a climate scientist at the us national oceanic and atmospheric administrations geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory in princeton new jersey now its something to explain researchers have followed various leads in recent years focusing mainly on a trio of factors the sun 1 atmospheric aerosol particles 2 and the oceans 3 the output of energy from the sun tends to wax and wane on an 11year cycle but the sun entered a prolonged lull around the turn of the millennium the natural 11year cycle is currently approaching its peak but thus far it has been the weakest solar maximum in a century this could help to explain both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the model simulations which include a higher solar output than earth has experienced since 2000 an unexpected increase in the number of stratospheric aerosol particles could be another factor keeping earth cooler than predicted these particles reflect sunlight back into space and scientists suspect that small volcanoes — and perhaps even industrialization in china — could have pumped extra aerosols into the stratosphere during the past 16 years depressing global temperatures some have argued that these two factors could be primary drivers of the hiatus but studies published in the past few years suggest that their effects are likely to be relatively small 4 5 trenberth for example analysed their impacts on the basis of satellite measurements of energy entering and exiting the planet and estimated that aerosols and solar activity account for just 20 of the hiatus that leaves the bulk of the hiatus to the oceans which serve as giant sponges for heat and here the spotlight falls on the equatorial pacific blowing hot and cold just before the hiatus took hold that region had turned unusually warm during the el niño of 1997–98 which fuelled extreme weather across the planet from floods in chile and california to droughts and wildfires in mexico and indonesia but it ended just as quickly as it had begun and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of el niños sister effect la niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial pacific with a vengeance more importantly the entire eastern pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day this variation in ocean temperature known as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo may be a crucial piece of the hiatus puzzle the cycle reverses every 15–30 years and in its positive phase the oscillation favours el niño which tends to warm the atmosphere see the fickle ocean after a couple of decades of releasing heat from the eastern and central pacific the region cools and enters the negative phase of the pdo this state tends towards la niña which brings cool waters up from the depths along the equator and tends to cool the planet researchers identified the pdo pattern in 1997 but have only recently begun to understand how it fits in with broader oceancirculation patterns and how it may help to explain the hiatus one important finding came in 2011 when a team of researchers at ncar led by gerald meehl reported that inserting a pdo pattern into global climate models causes decadescale breaks in global warming 3 oceantemperature data from the recent hiatus reveal why in a subsequent study the ncar researchers showed that more heat moved into the deep ocean after 1998 which helped to prevent the atmosphere from warming 6 in a third paper the group used computer models to document the flip side of the process when the pdo switches to its positive phase it heats up the surface ocean and atmosphere helping to drive decades of rapid warming 7 a key breakthrough came last year from shangping xie and yu kosaka at the scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla california the duo took a different tack by programming a model with actual sea surface temperatures from recent decades in the eastern equatorial pacific and then seeing what happened to the rest of the globe 8 their model not only recreated the hiatus in global temperatures but also reproduced some of the seasonal and regional climate trends that have marked the hiatus including warming in many areas and cooler northern winters it was actually a revelation for me when i saw that paper says john fyfe a climate modeller at the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis in victoria but it did not he adds explain everything what it skirted was the question of what is driving the tropical cooling univ washingtonipcc that was investigated by trenberth and john fasullo also at ncar who brought in winds and ocean data to explain how the pattern emerges 4 their study documents how tropical trade winds associated with la niña conditions help to drive warm water westward and ultimately deep into the ocean while promoting the upwelling of cool waters along the eastern equatorial region in extreme cases such as the la niña of 1998 this may be able to push the ocean into a cool phase of the pdo an analysis of historical data buttressed these conclusions showing that the cool phase of the pdo coincided with a few decades of cooler temperatures after the second world war see the pacifics global reach and that the warm phase lined up with the sharp spike seen in global temperatures between 1976 and 1998 ref 4 i believe the evidence is pretty clear says mark cane a climatologist at columbia university in new york its not about aerosols or stratospheric water vapour its about having had a decade of cooler temperatures in the eastern equatorial pacific heated debate cane was the first to predict the current cooling in the pacific although the implications werent clear at the time in 2004 he and his colleagues found that a simple regional climate model predicted a warm shift in the pacific that began around 1976 when global temperatures began to rise sharply 9 almost as an afterthought they concluded their paper with a simple forecast for what it is worth the model predicts that the 1998 el niño ended the post1976 tropical pacific warm period it is an eerily accurate result but the work remains hotly contested in part because it is based on a partial climate model that focuses on the equatorial pacific alone cane further maintains that the trend over the past century has been towards warmer temperatures in the western pacific relative to those in the east that opens the door he says to the possibility that warming from greenhouse gases is driving la niñalike conditions and could continue to do so in the future helping to suppress global warming if all of that is true its a negative feedback and if we dont capture it in our models they will overstate the warming he says there are two potential holes in his assessment first the historical oceantemperature data are notoriously imprecise leading many researchers to dispute canes assertion that the equatorial pacific shifted towards a more la niñalike state during the past century 10 second many researchers have found the opposite pattern in simulations with full climate models which factor in the suite of atmospheric and oceanic interactions beyond the equatorial pacific these tend to reveal a trend towards more el niñolike conditions as a result of global warming the difference seems to lie in part in how warming influences evaporation in areas of the pacific according to trenberth he says the models suggest that global warming has a greater impact on temperatures in the relatively cool east because the increase in evaporation adds water vapour to the atmosphere there and enhances atmospheric warming this effect is weaker in the warmer western pacific where the air is already saturated with moisture scientists may get to test their theories soon enough at present strong tropical trade winds are pushing ever more warm water westward towards indonesia fuelling storms such as novembers typhoon haiyan and nudging up sea levels in the western pacific they are now roughly 20 centimetres higher than those in the eastern pacific sooner or later the trend will inevitably reverse you cant keep piling up warm water in the western pacific trenberth says at some point the water will get so high that it just sloshes back and when that happens if scientists are on the right track the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again",

            "text": "The biggest mystery in climate science today may have begun, unbeknownst to anybody at the time, with a subtle weakening of the tropical trade winds blowing across the Pacific Ocean in late 1997. These winds normally push sun-baked water towards Indonesia. When they slackened, the warm water sloshed back towards South America, resulting in a spectacular example of a phenomenon known as El Niño. Average global temperatures hit a record high in 1998 — and then the warming stalled.\n\nFor several years, scientists wrote off the stall as noise in the climate system: the natural variations in the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere that drive warm or cool spells around the globe. But the pause has persisted, sparking a minor crisis of confidence in the field. Although there have been jumps and dips, average atmospheric temperatures have risen little since 1998, in seeming defiance of projections of climate models and the ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. Climate sceptics have seized on the temperature trends as evidence that global warming has ground to a halt. Climate scientists, meanwhile, know that heat must still be building up somewhere in the climate system, but they have struggled to explain where it is going, if not into the atmosphere. Some have begun to wonder whether there is something amiss in their models.\n\nNow, as the global-warming hiatus enters its sixteenth year, scientists are at last making headway in the case of the missing heat. Some have pointed to the Sun, volcanoes and even pollution from China as potential culprits, but recent studies suggest that the oceans are key to explaining the anomaly. The latest suspect is the El Niño of 1997–98, which pumped prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere — perhaps enough to tip the equatorial Pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since.\n\n“The 1997 to ’98 El Niño event was a trigger for the changes in the Pacific, and I think that’s very probably the beginning of the hiatus,” says Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. According to this theory, the tropical Pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming years.“Eventually,” Trenberth says, “it will switch back in the other direction.”\n\nOn a chart of global atmospheric temperatures, the hiatus stands in stark contrast to the rapid warming of the two decades that preceded it. Simulations conducted in advance of the 2013–14 assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that the warming should have continued at an average rate of 0.21 °C per decade from 1998 to 2012. Instead, the observed warming during that period was just 0.04 °C per decade, as measured by the UK Met Office in Exeter and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK.\n\nThe simplest explanation for both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the models is natural variability. Much like the swings between warm and cold in day-to-day weather, chaotic climate fluctuations can knock global temperatures up or down from year to year and decade to decade. Records of past climate show some long-lasting global heatwaves and cold snaps, and climate models suggest that either of these can occur as the world warms under the influence of greenhouse gases.\n\nBut none of the climate simulations carried out for the IPCC produced this particular hiatus at this particular time. That has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases, and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared. Others say that this conclusion goes against the long-term temperature trends, as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past. And many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively short-term blip in the climate. “If you are interested in global climate change, your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years,” says Susan Solomon, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.\n\nBut even those scientists who remain confident in the underlying models acknowledge that there is increasing pressure to work out just what is happening today. “A few years ago you saw the hiatus, but it could be dismissed because it was well within the noise,” says Gabriel Vecchi, a climate scientist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. “Now it’s something to explain.”\n\nResearchers have followed various leads in recent years, focusing mainly on a trio of factors: the Sun1, atmospheric aerosol particles2 and the oceans3. The output of energy from the Sun tends to wax and wane on an 11-year cycle, but the Sun entered a prolonged lull around the turn of the millennium. The natural 11-year cycle is currently approaching its peak, but thus far it has been the weakest solar maximum in a century. This could help to explain both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the model simulations, which include a higher solar output than Earth has experienced since 2000.\n\nAn unexpected increase in the number of stratospheric aerosol particles could be another factor keeping Earth cooler than predicted. These particles reflect sunlight back into space, and scientists suspect that small volcanoes — and perhaps even industrialization in China — could have pumped extra aerosols into the stratosphere during the past 16 years, depressing global temperatures.\n\nSome have argued that these two factors could be primary drivers of the hiatus, but studies published in the past few years suggest that their effects are likely to be relatively small4, 5. Trenberth, for example, analysed their impacts on the basis of satellite measurements of energy entering and exiting the planet, and estimated that aerosols and solar activity account for just 20% of the hiatus. That leaves the bulk of the hiatus to the oceans, which serve as giant sponges for heat. And here, the spotlight falls on the equatorial Pacific.\n\nJust before the hiatus took hold, that region had turned unusually warm during the El Niño of 1997–98, which fuelled extreme weather across the planet, from floods in Chile and California to droughts and wildfires in Mexico and Indonesia. But it ended just as quickly as it had begun, and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of El Niño’s sister effect, La Niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial Pacific with a vengeance. More importantly, the entire eastern Pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day.\n\nThis variation in ocean temperature, known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), may be a crucial piece of the hiatus puzzle. The cycle reverses every 15–30 years, and in its positive phase, the oscillation favours El Niño, which tends to warm the atmosphere (see ‘The fickle ocean’). After a couple of decades of releasing heat from the eastern and central Pacific, the region cools and enters the negative phase of the PDO. This state tends towards La Niña, which brings cool waters up from the depths along the Equator and tends to cool the planet. Researchers identified the PDO pattern in 1997, but have only recently begun to understand how it fits in with broader ocean-circulation patterns and how it may help to explain the hiatus.\n\nOne important finding came in 2011, when a team of researchers at NCAR led by Gerald Meehl reported that inserting a PDO pattern into global climate models causes decade-scale breaks in global warming3. Ocean-temperature data from the recent hiatus reveal why: in a subsequent study, the NCAR researchers showed that more heat moved into the deep ocean after 1998, which helped to prevent the atmosphere from warming6. In a third paper, the group used computer models to document the flip side of the process: when the PDO switches to its positive phase, it heats up the surface ocean and atmosphere, helping to drive decades of rapid warming7.\n\nA key breakthrough came last year from Shang-Ping Xie and Yu Kosaka at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. The duo took a different tack, by programming a model with actual sea surface temperatures from recent decades in the eastern equatorial Pacific, and then seeing what happened to the rest of the globe8. Their model not only recreated the hiatus in global temperatures, but also reproduced some of the seasonal and regional climate trends that have marked the hiatus, including warming in many areas and cooler northern winters.\n\n“It was actually a revelation for me when I saw that paper,” says John Fyfe, a climate modeller at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis in Victoria. But it did not, he adds, explain everything. “What it skirted was the question of what is driving the tropical cooling.”\n\nThat was investigated by Trenberth and John Fasullo, also at NCAR, who brought in winds and ocean data to explain how the pattern emerges4. Their study documents how tropical trade winds associated with La Niña conditions help to drive warm water westward and, ultimately, deep into the ocean, while promoting the upwelling of cool waters along the eastern equatorial region. In extreme cases, such as the La Niña of 1998, this may be able to push the ocean into a cool phase of the PDO. An analysis of historical data buttressed these conclusions, showing that the cool phase of the PDO coincided with a few decades of cooler temperatures after the Second World War (see ‘The Pacific’s global reach’), and that the warm phase lined up with the sharp spike seen in global temperatures between 1976 and 1998 (ref. 4).\n\n“I believe the evidence is pretty clear,” says Mark Cane, a climatologist at Columbia University in New York. “It’s not about aerosols or stratospheric water vapour; it’s about having had a decade of cooler temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific.”\n\nCane was the first to predict the current cooling in the Pacific, although the implications weren’t clear at the time. In 2004, he and his colleagues found that a simple regional climate model predicted a warm shift in the Pacific that began around 1976, when global temperatures began to rise sharply9. Almost as an afterthought, they concluded their paper with a simple forecast: “For what it is worth the model predicts that the 1998 El Niño ended the post-1976 tropical Pacific warm period.”\n\nIt is an eerily accurate result, but the work remains hotly contested, in part because it is based on a partial climate model that focuses on the equatorial Pacific alone. Cane further maintains that the trend over the past century has been towards warmer temperatures in the western Pacific relative to those in the east. That opens the door, he says, to the possibility that warming from greenhouse gases is driving La Niña-like conditions and could continue to do so in the future, helping to suppress global warming. “If all of that is true, it’s a negative feedback, and if we don’t capture it in our models they will overstate the warming,” he says.\n\nThere are two potential holes in his assessment. First, the historical ocean-temperature data are notoriously imprecise, leading many researchers to dispute Cane’s assertion that the equatorial Pacific shifted towards a more La Niña-like state during the past century10. Second, many researchers have found the opposite pattern in simulations with full climate models, which factor in the suite of atmospheric and oceanic interactions beyond the equatorial Pacific. These tend to reveal a trend towards more El Niño-like conditions as a result of global warming. The difference seems to lie, in part, in how warming influences evaporation in areas of the Pacific, according to Trenberth. He says the models suggest that global warming has a greater impact on temperatures in the relatively cool east, because the increase in evaporation adds water vapour to the atmosphere there and enhances atmospheric warming; this effect is weaker in the warmer western Pacific, where the air is already saturated with moisture.\n\nScientists may get to test their theories soon enough. At present, strong tropical trade winds are pushing ever more warm water westward towards Indonesia, fuelling storms such as November’s Typhoon Haiyan, and nudging up sea levels in the western Pacific; they are now roughly 20 centimetres higher than those in the eastern Pacific. Sooner or later, the trend will inevitably reverse. “You can’t keep piling up warm water in the western Pacific,” Trenberth says. “At some point, the water will get so high that it just sloshes back.” And when that happens, if scientists are on the right track, the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again.",

summarises the current state of global temperature trends including detailing the importance of the current cooling in the tropical pacific and the prospects for new global temperature records in 2014 or 2015 if an el niño eventuates the rate of global warming is slower in the past decade than in the prior three decades slower growth of net climate forcings and cooling in the tropical pacific ocean both contribute to the slower warming rate with the latter probably the more important effect the tropical pacific cooling is probably unforced variability at least in large part the trend toward an increased frequency of extreme hot summer anomalies over land areas has continued despite the pacific ocean cooling the bell curves for observed temperature anomalies show that because of larger unforced variability in winter it is more difficult in winter than in summer to recognize the effect of global warming on the occurrence of extreme warm or cold seasons it appears that there is substantial likelihood of an el niño beginning in 2014 and as a result a probable record global temperature in 2014 or 2015 coral growth bands extend history of pacific decadal oscillation phases a

            "text": "What pause in global warming? The Oceans take up about 93 per cent of the solar energy hitting the earth. The graphs show clearly there has been no let up in global warming, with oceans continuing to warm.\n\nWhile atmospheric temperatures appear to have slowed over the last 15 years - a warming hiatus - but substantial warming is still occurring to the global system including adding heat to the world's oceans, melting Arctic sea ice, and the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.\n\nNOAA have just released their analysis of 2013 and determined the year tied with 2003 as the fourth warmest year globally since records began in 1880. For ocean temperatures the report said:\n\nCaption: Comparison of Ocean heat content from 0 - 700 meters and 2 - 2000m. Source: NOAA\n\n(S Levitus et al 2012) in their 2012 published study, World ocean heat content and thermosteric sea level change (0–2000 m), 1955–2010 detail their important results:\n\nWe are currently in a negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a cycle with phases that can last between 15 to 30 years. During a negative phase waters are cooler and heat mixes into deeper levels of the north Pacific ocean. When the next phase change ocurrs to a positive PDO we are likely to see some of the stored ocean heat released spiking atmospheric temperatures.\n\nThe Pacific Decadal oscillation was only identified by scientists in the 1990s, and we only have accurate observational data for identifying it going back some 50-60 years. Nathan J Mantua and SR Hare from the University of Washington in Seattle described the operation of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in the Journal of Oceanography in 2002 (Mantua & Hare 2002 PDF). Read more about the PDO from the Climate Impacts Group from University of Washington.\n\nWikipedia describes the basics of the PDO cycle:\n\nThe Pacific Decadal Oscillation affects the cycles of the more frequent El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During the PDO negative phase ENSO responds with periods of La Niña predominating, while a PDO positive phase El Niño patterns are more likely to occur.\n\nWikipedia again on how the PDO impacts our climate variability:\n\nA number of studies have identified a possible link between the PDO and decadal East Asian Monsoon variability and the associated summer rainfall and temperature changes over East China. (See YU Lei, 2013 - PDF). Increased rainfall and decreased summer temperature is also observed over the Indian subcontinent during the negative phase.\n\nWe entered a negative phase of the PDO in 1998 after the El Niño of 1998 that set record setting global temperatures which climate sceptics like to cherry pick their start dates from for spreading confusion on temperature trends.\n\nWhen the Pacific Decadal Oscillation switches to a positive phase, which may happen relatively soon, we are likely to see more El Niño cycles and an outburst of heat from the ocean pushing up atmospheric temperatures. If you think the heat was bad in the record setting Australian temperatures of 2013 in a neutral ENSO period, they could be further elevated by the next strong El Niño in the positive phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.\n\n“The 1997 to ’98 El Niño event was a trigger for the changes in the Pacific, and I think that’s very probably the beginning of the hiatus,” says Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. According to this theory, the tropical Pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming years.“Eventually, it will switch back in the other direction.” Trenbeth told Nature in a news article on the missing heat.\n\nModelling results published January 2014 show that the \"North Pacific ocean decadal variability, its dominant mode (i.e., PDO), and atmospheric decadal variability, have become weaker under global warming, but with PDO shifting to a higher frequency.\" (Changfang Fang et al 2014) in a paper titled The impact of global warming on the pacific decadal oscillation and the possible mechanism.\n\nRecent studies by Scientists are also identifying that El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is likely to intensify and become more frequent with global warming. Research published in January 2014 indicates that Global warming is doubling the risk of Extreme El Ninos.\n\nA new study by researchers at the University of Queensland have identified the signs of the PDO phases in flood marks from Queensland's Fitzroy River contained in coral growth bands.\n\nCaption: Figure 2.

The study examined century-old coral colonies – “bommies” – around the Keppel Islands, 50km from the Fitzroy River mouth.\n\nCo-author Professor Jian-xin Zhao, also from UQ’s School of Earth Sciences, said “This is a significant advance in our understanding of climate variability.”\n\nLike the growth rings in trees that can give year by year seasonal information on a range of environmental factors, corals can provide a similar history and clues to environmental conditions when viewed under ultraviolet light.\n\n“As a result of this research, we now know that corals from this area have great potential for reconstructing even longer-term historical evolution of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation,” Co-author Professor John Pandolfi, from UQ’s School of Biological Sciences, said.\n\n“Some bommies are five to six metres tall and 400 years old.

This will help refine future models for predicting this important climate phenomenon.”\n\nResearchers from NIOZ Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and The University of Western Australia’s Oceans Institute/School of Earth and Environment also worked on the research.\n\nA similar study of corals near Hainan that was published May 2013 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, identified Variations in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation since 1853 in a coral record from the northern South China Sea (Wenfeng Deng et al 2013).

section 14222 p 774 emphasis added the above sentence went missing from subsequent ipcc reports apparently it was once part of the consensus though even though it has disappeared it nevertheless inadvertently blurted out the truth a famous climategate email dialog follows below dr phil jones – cru emails – 5th july 2005 the scientific community would come down on me in no uncertain terms if i said the world had cooled from 1998 ok it has but it is only 7 years of data and it isnt statistically significant dr phil jones – cru emails – 7th may 2009 bottom line the no upward trend has to

it has been more than 15 years of no warming now time to get worried you betcha a new paper by the above mentioned dr trenberth acknowledges the importance of the socalled pacific decadal oscillation in determining relatively short term warming and cooling cycles short term meaning decades in this case but the socalled skeptics have pointed to this for a very long time more about the paper can be found here the pacific decadal oscillation keep in mind that in the mid 1970s the scientific consensus was worried about global cooling and an imminent new ice age – click to enlarge a recent article in nature discusses the case of the missing heat and what progress is being made in explaining away the fact that none of the models predicting global warming by co2 forcing can account for the observed reality as a reminder here is the difference between the model predictions and what has actually happened the predictions of hansens climate model presented to the us congress in 1988 versus the reality source climatesensenorpag – click to enlarge however instead of simply admitting that the models may be wrong the heat is held to be hiding out in the oceans it is apparently widely hoped that it will return in time to save careers and grants from nature now as the globalwarming hiatus enters its sixteenth year scientists are at last making headway in the case of the missing heat some have pointed to the sun volcanoes and even pollution from china as potential culprits but recent studies suggest that the oceans are key to explaining the anomaly the latest suspect is the el niño of 1997–98 which pumped prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere — perhaps enough to tip the equatorial pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since the 1997 to 98 el niño event was a trigger for the changes in the pacific and i think thats very probably the beginning of the hiatus says kevin trenberth a climate scientist at the national center for atmospheric research ncar in boulder colorado according to this theory the tropical pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming years eventually trenberth says it will switch back in the other direction translation please dear lord let it switch back as soon as possible or the warming check is in the mail that is however perhaps less likely than thought see further below why if one looks at the chart of the pdo above a common sense question immediately springs to mind why was the warming trend prior to 1940 almost identical to that between 1976 and 1998 when obviously co2 emissions at the time can not have been a major factor this is not explained anywhere could it be that natural climate variability is actually the major factor in driving both warming and cooling phases and that co2 emissions by humans are in fact a negligible input interesting is also the following comment by another climate researcher cited in the nature article none of the climate simulations carried out for the ipcc produced this particular hiatus at this particular time that has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared others say that this conclusion goes against the longterm temperature trends as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past and many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively shortterm blip in the climate if you are interested in global climate change your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years says susan solomon a climate scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge emphasis added does that mean that if there is no warming for another century their vaunted models will still not be proved wrong if that is so then the science is guaranteed to only advance one funeral at a time as the saying goes by the way the differentiation between skeptics and scientists is an insult to the many skeptics who are in fact scientists and whose ranks are set to swell in our opinion temperature anomaly vs atmospheric co2 over the past 11000 years data gathered by examination of ice cores click to enlarge several skeptics are naturally pointing out that their work is suddenly integrated into the consensus with not a word being mentioned of the ridicule and opposition they had to endure for so long for instance here are dr sebastian lüning and prof fritz vahrenholt it took a while but ocean cycles have finally been adopted by the ipcc as an important climate factor with john fasullo kevin trenberth has written in a new paper appearing in the journal earths future that the warming pause taking place since 1998 indeed may have something to do with the pacific decadal oscillation pdo also even trenberths pal stefan rahmstorf suddenly thinks its a good possibility in 2012 when we brought up the pdo as one of the triggers for the 19761998 warming in our die kalte sonne book and proposed ocean cycles as a sort of pulse generator for temperature cycles on a decadal scale we were met with fierce resistance from the german climate science establishment now less than 2 years later die kalte sonne finds itself as mainstream science they also mention an interesting comment made by julia slingo of the met office at a royal society meeting last year she was playing devils advocate the devil being all those who say the climate models are crap ie the deniers and asked a well known alarmist a question he ultimately couldnt answer at a royal society meeting in 2013 julia slingo of the met office played devils advocate and posed the following question to prof jochen marotzke of the german max planck institute of meteorology see the 4246 mark royalsocietyorgmarotzkemp3 it s a great presentation about 15 years being irrelevant but i think some of us might say if you look at the pacific decadal oscillation and it s timescale that it appears to work it could be 30 years and therefore i think you know we are still not out of the woods yet on this one if you do think it s internal variability and you say we do think the pacific decadal oscillation is a key component of this and it s now in it s particular phase but was previously in the opposite phase could you not therefore explain the accelerated warming of the 80s and 90s as being driven by the other phase of natural variability simplifying slingos incoherence if the current cooling is due to the negative pdo phase then wouldn t the warming of the 80s and 90s be a result of the positive pdo phase back then marotzke answers after much incoherence of his own um i guess i m not sure these people make no sense at all they are sure its the oceans cold phase gobbling up heat when temperatures fail to rise but when temperatures increase they just cant be sure that the oceans are involved at all and insist they would not bet much money on it of course it just cant work only one way marotzke is delivering only what would call unadulterated absurd science emphasis added to ms slingos query what does were not out of the woods really mean that they are scared they have exaggerated and are as one commentator at anthony watts site remarked in need of an exit strategy the problem of modeling the future of a complex system the big problem is that the climate models that are at the root of the catastrophic anthropogenic global warming forecasts are trying to do something that is literally impossible below is a video of a presentation by christopher essex professor and associate chair in the department of applied mathematics at the university of western ontario and former director of its theoretical physics program now one thing we can expect professor essex to know a thing or two about are the mathematics behind the modeling and this is what the presentation focuses on it is done in a way that makes it possible even for a layperson to easily discern what the problems of these models are and that in fact these problems are insurmountable at least at present as an aside professor essex is of course both a skeptic and a scientist and he is far from alone for instance we would like to point readers to a 2009 paper he coauthored with eight other scholars and which has been reviewed by 50 others entitled critical topics in global warming the introduction tells us a little bit about the socalled consensus the issue of global warming is the subject of two parallel debates one scientific focused on the analyses of complex and conflicting data the other political addressing what is the proper response of government to a hypothetical risk proponents of an immediate and sweeping regulatory response insist that the scientific debate has long been settled but a fair reading of the science as presented in the fraser institutes independent summary for policymakers ispm proves otherwise the supplements to that report go deeper into some of the key topics and provide even more evidence that popularized notions about the causes and consequences of global warming are more fiction than fact when looking at the presentation below it becomes crystal clear why the science especially with regard to climate models simply can not be regarded as settled believing 6 impossible things before breakfast and climate modeling by christopher essex the quiet sun now a few remarks on why the missing heat may well go on missing for a good while yet below is an excerpt from a recent article published by the bcc regarding the activity of the sun which has declined to its lowest in at least a century scientists are baffled by this behavior – something highly unusual is evidently happening ive been a solar physicist for 30 years and ive never seen anything quite like this says richard harrison head of space physics at the rutherford appleton laboratory in oxfordshire he shows me recent footage captured by spacecraft that have their sights trained on our star the sun is revealed in exquisite detail but its face is strangely featureless if you want to go back to see when the sun was this inactive youve got to go back about 100 years he says this solar lull is baffling scientists because right now the sun should be awash with activity it has reached its solar maximum the point in its 11year cycle where activity is at a peak this giant ball of plasma should be peppered with sunspots exploding with flares and spewing out huge clouds of charged particles into space in the form of coronal mass ejections but apart from the odd event like some recent solar flares it has been very quiet and this damp squib of a maximum follows a solar minimum – the period when the suns activity troughs – that was longer and lower than scientists expected its completely taken me and many other solar scientists by surprise says dr lucie green from university college londons mullard space science laboratory the drop off in activity is happening surprisingly quickly and scientists are now watching closely to see if it will continue to plummet it could mean a very very inactive star it would feel like the sun is asleep a very dormant ball of gas at the centre of our solar system explains dr green this though would certainly not be the first time this has happened during the latter half of the 17th century the sun went through an extremely quiet phase – a period called the maunder minimum historical records reveal that sunspots virtually disappeared during this time dr green says there is a very strong hint that the sun is acting in the same way now as it did in the runup to the maunder minimum mike lockwood professor of space environment physics from the university of reading thinks there is a significant chance that the sun could become increasingly quiet an analysis of icecores which hold a longterm record of solar activity suggests the decline in activity is the fastest that has been seen in 10000 years its an unusually rapid decline explains prof lockwood we estimate that within about 40 years or so there is a 10 to 20 – nearer 20 – probability that well be back in maunder minimum conditions the era of solar inactivity in the 17th century coincided with a period of bitterly cold winters in europe londoners enjoyed frost fairs on the thames after it froze over snow cover across the continent increased the baltic sea iced over – the conditions were so harsh some describe it as a miniice age emphasis added the article naturally goes on to point out that according to the ipcc the effect of co2 emissions tops every other influence on the climate no wonder as co2 emissions can be taxed try taxing the sun although the odd men out who think the sun is far more important are mentioned in passing but not to worry at worst we will miss the polar lights henceforth somehow this doesnt feel very reassuring – after all if the maunder minimum was irrelevant to the climate then why was there a little ice age admittedly it remains an open question how important the suns activity is to the climate – after all if a complex system like the earths climate can not be successfully modeled this holds for the past as well as for the future it is not possible to state apodictically that the maunder minimum produced the little ice age intuitively though we tend to think that the sun is indeed an important factor on a geological time scale the last major ice age happened only a very short time ago and we know that there have been vast variations in average temperatures over large time scales in fact it is only because we live in a warming cycle on these large time scales an interglacial period that human civilization as we know it exists at all try to imagine feeding more than 7 billion people with the planet a full 8 to 10 degrees celsius colder and with a large part of its landmass covered in ice of course that is certainly not an imminent problem but looking at the regularity with which glacial and interglacial periods occur it seems obvious that it will become a problem one day we happen to think that even a mini ice age could be quite a nuisance it would definitely make life a lot more uncomfortable in the northern hemisphere currently there is no certainty what precisely the main cause of ice ages is but cycles related to the sun specifically the milankovitch cycles which describe changes in earths orbit around the sun are undoubtedly playing a role temperatures plus co2 and dust concentration in the atmosphere over the past 400000 odd years via the vostok ice core data and yes co2 tends to follow temperature it doesnt lead presumably there are feedback loops at work though with higher co2 concentration and temperature reinforcing each other during the up and downswings click to enlarge what is slightly worrisome about the above chart is that the very cold periods tend to have a much longer duration than the warm periods which seem to have a tendency to produce shortlived spike highs in fact the behavior of the long term temperature chart looks very similar to the price charts of a number of commodities conclusion the backtracking has begun – as a first step climate skeptics see their work suddenly integrated into the mainstream however we are not yet at the point where the models are rejected or the greenhouse gascentric agw theory is truly abandoned instead were now in the how can we keep saying we are right while were obviously wrong phase a lot is at stake after all scientific reputations but most importantly a lot of money policymakers dont want to hear that there is no problem because that would close off a major source of tax revenues as well as what is currently a major avenue for crony capitalism and pork barrel spending through the subsidization of uneconomic green energy schemes entire vast bureaucracies depend on agw as well and there is no alternative promotion in sight yet that could replace this sheer inexhaustible and vast fount of tax payer funded nonactivity so now the hope is that the heat is hiding out deep in the oceans and ready to return at the drop of a hat or rather a turn of the trade winds that may however not happen what then",

            "text": "Heated debate\n\nCane was the first to predict the current cooling in the Pacific, although the implications weren’t clear at the time. In 2004, he and his colleagues found that a simple regional climate model predicted a warm shift in the Pacific that began around 1976, when global temperatures began to rise sharply9. Almost as an afterthought, they concluded their paper with a simple forecast: “For what it is worth the model predicts that the 1998 El Niño ended the post-1976 tropical Pacific warm period.”\n\nIt is an eerily accurate result, but the work remains hotly contested, in part because it is based on a partial climate model that focuses on the equatorial Pacific alone. Cane further maintains that the trend over the past century has been towards warmer temperatures in the western Pacific relative to those in the east. That opens the door, he says, to the possibility that warming from greenhouse gases is driving La Niña-like conditions and could continue to do so in the future, helping to suppress global warming. “If all of that is true, it’s a negative feedback, and if we don’t capture it in our models they will overstate the warming,” he says.\n\nThere are two potential holes in his assessment. First, the historical ocean-temperature data are notoriously imprecise, leading many researchers to dispute Cane’s assertion that the equatorial Pacific shifted towards a more La Niña-like state during the past century10. Second, many researchers have found the opposite pattern in simulations with full climate models, which factor in the suite of atmospheric and oceanic interactions beyond the equatorial Pacific. These tend to reveal a trend towards more El Niño-like conditions as a result of global warming. The difference seems to lie, in part, in how warming influences evaporation in areas of the Pacific, according to Trenberth. He says the models suggest that global warming has a greater impact on temperatures in the relatively cool east, because the increase in evaporation adds water vapour to the atmosphere there and enhances atmospheric warming; this effect is weaker in the warmer western Pacific, where the air is already saturated with moisture.\n\nScientists may get to test their theories soon enough. At present, strong tropical trade winds are pushing ever more warm water westward towards Indonesia, fuelling storms such as November’s Typhoon Haiyan, and nudging up sea levels in the western Pacific; they are now roughly 20 centimetres higher than those in the eastern Pacific. Sooner or later, the trend will inevitably reverse. “You can’t keep piling up warm water in the western Pacific,” Trenberth says. “At some point, the water will get so high that it just sloshes back.” And when that happens, if scientists are on the right track, the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again.",

            "text": "by\n\nEven Nature has acknowledged that the Pause is real, and that the models are missing something:\n\nAverage global temperatures hit a record high in 1998 — and then the warming stalled. For several years, scientists wrote off the stall as noise in the climate system: the natural variations in the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere that drive warm or cool spells around the globe. But the pause has persisted, sparking a minor crisis of confidence in the field. Although there have been jumps and dips, average atmospheric temperatures have risen little since 1998, in seeming defiance of projections of climate models and the ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. [...] But none of the climate simulations carried out for the IPCC produced this particular hiatus at this particular time. That has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases, and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared.\n\nBut let’s take a look at the headbangers over at Un-Skeptical Pseudo-Science. To start with, the Pause. In 2008, the page read as follows:\n\nDid global warming stop in 1998? 1998 was an unusually hot year as it featured the strongest El Nino of the century. In fact, from Jan to May, 2007 is tied with 1998 as hottest year on record. The WMO reported in August that January and April 2007 were the hottest on record. However, when determining trends, you don’t pick one month or year out of isolation – particularly if that year features a short term weather anomaly like El Nino. By this method, based on the fact that 2005 was .17°C hotter than 2000, you could conclude that the rate of global warming doubled from 2000 to 2005.\n\nUsing the fudged surface temperature sets, Un-Sk Ps-Sc was still able to claim the climate was still warming (phew). Fast forward to 2014. Another six years of no warming, and the only alternative is to… er, change the subject to ocean heat instead:\n\nThere’s also a tendency for some people just to concentrate on surface air temperatures when there are other, more useful, indicators that can perhaps give us a better idea how rapidly the world is warming. Oceans for instance — due to their immense size and heat storing capability (called ‘thermal mass’) — tend to give a much more ‘steady’ indication of the warming that is happening. Here records show that the Earth has been warming at a steady rate before and since 1998 and there’s no signs of it slowing any time soon.\n\nAnd the evidence for this is from a paper by one of their own – Dana Nuccitelli. Handy!\n\nHow about the accuracy of models in 2008? Un-Sk Ps-Sc used some graphs cut and pasted from the IPCC’s third assessment report (in 2001), to fool the sheep into believing that models were just perfect:\n\nThey then claim that observed temperatures “closely match” Hansen’s Scenario B, helped no doubt by the multiple fudge factors applied to GISS temperature data. If satellite data had been used instead, the argument would be far less compelling.\n\nToday’s version of the page is still using those graphs from 2001, now a whole two IPCC reports out of date. It still plugs the Hansen Scenario B, despite the observed temperature series ending in 2005.\n\nAnd just today, Nuccitelli, writing in his ‘97%’ column in the Guardian uses a figure which conveniently supports the same position, despite the fact that balloon and satellite data show an increasing divergence between observations and models.\n\nWhen the usually warmist Nature concedes that something is happening to the climate system which was not forecast by the models, then you should listen.\n\nAnd in fact, most ‘proper’ scientists would look at this as an opportunity to further the understanding of the drivers of climate change, both natural and anthropogenic, but the headbangers at Un-Sk Ps-Sc would much rather stick their heads in the sand and pretend nothing has changed.\n\nIt could almost be said that they were denying the reality… but that would be petty, wouldn’t it?",

at the national center for atmospheric research ncar in boulder colorado according to this theory the tropical pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming yearseventually trenberth says it will switch back in the other direction brilliant it has been getting colder and could get colder still but eventually it will get warmer its the bloody climate its always getting colder or warmer in cycles that operate over years decades centuries millennia and even millions of years the unvoiced truth here is that all of the climate model based simulations that were held up as proof that the climate was going awry were wrong all of them simulations conducted in advance of the 2013–14 assessment from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc suggest that the warming should have continued at an average rate of 021°c per decade from 1998 to 2012 instead the observed warming during that period was just 004°c per decade as measured by the uk met office in exeter and the climatic research unit at the university of east anglia in norwich uk according to jeff tollefson a science writer at nature the simplest explanation for both the pause and the model prediction discrepancies is natural variability chaotic climate fluctuations can send global temperatures up or down from year to year and even decade to decade supposedly climate models suggest that longlasting global heatwaves and cold snaps can occur as the world warms under the influence of greenhouse gases but none of the climate simulations carried out for the ipcc produced this particular hiatus at this particular time tollefson opines that has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared in other words climate theory at least when it comes to sensitivity to atmospheric c02 levels could be wrong that is how science works theories are proposed then they are tested by comparison to the real world if they are proven wrong or found wanting they are replaced by new theories repeat as necessary why has it proven so difficult for climate scientists to back away from the outrageous claims they made decades ago not so long ago warmist climate types were saying you needed ten or fifteen years to establish a real trend many researchers still caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively shortterm blip in the climate but the if you are interested in global climate change your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years says susan solomon a climate scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology the timeframe changes but the song remains the same according to judith curry a professor at georgia institute of technologys school of earth and atmospheric sciences solomon should have stated that if you are interested in the climate response to a longterm secular buildup of greenhouse gases then your main focus should be timescales of 50100 years i agree with this and if you look at the last 100 years you have that other inconvenient pause to explain 19401975 the pacific cycles have been controlling shortterm climate change for decades in their near panic some climatologists are looking to the suns changing output for an explanation energy received from the sun tends to wax and wane on an 11year cycle but some researchers suggest that longer term variability in our stars output could explain things like the medieval warm period or the little ice age perhaps even the recent modest warming trend even when new mechanisms that amplify the suns natural variability were discovered the linkage between climate change and the suns output was poopooed by the climate change establishment indeed the sun entered a prolonged lull around the turn of the millennium the natural 11year cycle has again passed its peak and the recent solar maximum proved to be the weakest in a century this could help to explain both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the model simulations which include a higher solar output than earth has experienced since 2000 writes tollefson but no that would be too logical too easy besides we have the culprit that daemon carbon dioxide the missing global warming must be here somewhere frantic warmists have turned to the ocean the equatorial pacific in particular in the hunt for the missing heat just before the hiatus took hold that region had turned unusually warm during the el niño of 1997–98 which fuelled extreme weather across the planet from floods in chile and california to droughts and wildfires in mexico and indonesia but it ended just as quickly as it had begun and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of el niños sister effect la niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial pacific with a vengeance more importantly the entire eastern pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day others have jumped on the el niñola niña bandwagon including shangping xie and yu kosaka from the scripps institution of oceanography typical of modern climatologists they turned to modeling by driving a model with actual sea surface temperatures from recent decades their model reportedly recreated the pause in global temperature rise and even reproduced some of the seasonal and regional climate trends occurring during the hiatus comparison of predicted and actual temperatures in the historical hist experiment the model is forced with observed atmospheric composition changes and the solar cycle in the pacific ocean–global atmosphere poga experiments sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the equatorial eastern pacific 82 of the earths surface follow observed measurements while their result is certainly an improvement over other modeling attempts it is really not a surprise that when you force a model with the observed temperature over time you end up getting output that closely follows the real temperatures there is an old saying if you torture the data long enough it will tell you what you want to hear computer models simply automate the process of data abuse more impressive mark cane a climatologist at columbia university was the first to predict the current cooling in the pacific back in 2004 although the implications werent clear at the time i believe the evidence is pretty clear he said its not about aerosols or stratospheric water vapor its about having had a decade of cooler temperatures in the eastern equatorial pacific but the models do not explain everything says john fyfe a climate modeler at the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis commenting on the paper by xie and kosaka what it skirted was the question of what is driving the tropical cooling assuming the mechanism behind the climate oscillation is the shifting water temperatures in the pacific could this mean that the vaunted temperature rise that drove the global warming debate during the 80s and 90s was caused by the ocean dumping heat it had already stored up as part of a natural cycle once the heat was released into the atmosphere it was eventually radiated back into space during a period of relatively high solar activity in the meantime the ocean is now doing the reverse cooling the atmosphere reinforcing the cooling trend scientists report the suns activity is at its lowest for 100 years some are even warning of a new maunder minimum and an accompanying plunge in global temperatures the recent solar maximum was the weakest in 100 years has the sun gone to sleep are we about to swing from global warming to a new ice age nobody really knows and if they say they do they are lying human climate science is still a crude inexact practice and its practitioners are a lot less knowledgeable than they let on yet the dire warnings continue to flow from the warmist camp accompanied by demands for more funding for research in reality the current climate change debate is nothing more than special interest politics competing in the news media for fame and public funding nassim taleb and constantine sandis published a paper expounding what they termed the skin in the game heuristic though aimed primarily at the field of statistics the authors posit that anyone making claims or predictions that could profit themselves while bringing harm to others should be held responsible for their actions we propose a global and morally mandatory heuristic that anyone involved in an action which can possibly generate harm for others even probabilistically should be required to be exposed to some damage regardless of context therein lies the problem with global warming research—the predicted damage occurs far in the future beyond the lifetimes of the scientists yammering on about climate catastrophes on the horizon if the predictions do not come true there will still be immense damage of an economic nature—ruined industries and ruined lives because of irrational fear spread by people all long retired and mostly long dead with little threat of contradiction the inertia of group think—the much ballyhooed consensus—holds fast john tooby captured the essence of scientific consensus because intellectuals are densely networked in selfselecting groups whose members prestige is linked we incubate endless selfserving elite superstitions with baleful effects on the other hand for climate researchers the global warming panic has been a goldmine government funds have been showered on researchers at universities and government agencies in an effort to cover politicians posteriors for climate scientists the profits are in the present and the risk of being wrong far in the uncertain future in short they have no skin in the game nothing to lose and everything to gain by pandering to the green lobby and other climate cranks full story",

The latest idea floated is that the El Niño of 1997–98 tipped the equatorial Pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since. This was preceded by the pumping of prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere, a trend now reversed.\n\n“The 1997 to ’98 El Niño event was a trigger for the changes in the Pacific, and I think that’s very probably the beginning of the hiatus,” says Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. According to this theory, the tropical Pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming years.“Eventually,” Trenberth says, “it will switch back in the other direction.”\n\nBrilliant. It has been getting colder and could get colder still, but eventually it will get warmer. It’s the bloody climate! It’s always getting colder or warmer, in cycles that operate over years, decades, centuries, millennia, and even millions of years. The unvoiced truth here is that all of the climate model based simulations that were held up as “proof” that the climate was going awry were wrong. All of them. Simulations conducted in advance of the 2013–14 assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that the warming should have continued at an average rate of 0.21°C per decade from 1998 to 2012. Instead, the observed warming during that period was just 0.04°C per decade, as measured by the UK Met Office in Exeter and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK.\n\nAccording to Jeff Tollefson, a science writer at Nature, the simplest explanation for both the pause and the model prediction discrepancies is natural variability. Chaotic climate fluctuations can send global temperatures up or down from year to year and even decade to decade. Supposedly, climate models suggest that long-lasting global heatwaves and cold snaps can occur as the world warms under the influence of greenhouse gases.\n\n“But none of the climate simulations carried out for the IPCC produced this particular hiatus at this particular time,” Tollefson opines. “That has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases, and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared.”\n\nIn other words, climate theory, at least when it comes to sensitivity to atmospheric C02 levels, could be wrong. That is how science works: theories are proposed; then they are tested by comparison to the real world; if they are proven wrong or found wanting they are replaced by new theories. Repeat as necessary. Why has it proven so difficult for climate scientists to back away from the outrageous claims they made decades ago?\n\nNot so long ago, warmist climate types were saying you needed ten or fifteen years to establish a real trend. Many researchers still caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively short-term blip in the climate, but the “If you are interested in global climate change, your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years,” says Susan Solomon, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The time-frame changes but the song remains the same.\n\nAccording to Judith Curry, a professor at Georgia Institute of Technology’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences: “Solomon should have stated that if you are interested in the climate response to a long-term secular buildup of greenhouse gases, then your main focus should be timescales of 50-100 years.  I agree with this.  And if you look at the last 100 years, you have that other inconvenient pause to explain: 1940-1975.”\n\nIn their near panic, some climatologists are looking to the Sun’s changing output for an explanation. Energy received from the Sun tends to wax and wane on an 11-year cycle, but some researchers suggest that longer term variability in our star’s output could explain things like the Medieval Warm Period or the Little Ice Age, perhaps even the recent modest warming trend. Even when new mechanisms that amplify the Sun’s natural variability were discovered, the linkage between climate change and the Sun’s output was poo-pooed by the climate change establishment.\n\nIndeed, the Sun entered a prolonged lull around the turn of the millennium. The natural 11-year cycle has again passed its peak, and the recent solar maximum proved to be the weakest in a century. “This could help to explain both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the model simulations, which include a higher solar output than Earth has experienced since 2000,” writes Tollefson. But no, that would be too logical, too easy. Besides we have the culprit, that daemon carbon dioxide. The missing global warming must be here somewhere. Frantic warmists have turned to the Ocean, the equatorial Pacific in particular, in the hunt for the missing heat:\n\nOthers have jumped on the El Niño/La Niña bandwagon, including Shang-Ping Xie and Yu Kosaka from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Typical of modern climatologists, they turned to modeling. By driving a model with actual sea surface temperatures from recent decades, their model reportedly recreated the pause in global temperature rise, and even reproduced some of the seasonal and regional climate trends occurring during the hiatus.\n\nIn the historical (HIST) experiment the model is forced with observed atmospheric composition changes and the solar cycle. In the Pacific Ocean–Global Atmosphere (POGA) experiments, sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the equatorial eastern Pacific (8.2% of the Earth’s surface) follow observed measurements. While their result is certainly an improvement over other modeling attempts it is really not a surprise that, when you force a model with the observed temperature over time, you end up getting output that closely follows the real temperatures. There is an old saying: “If you torture the data long enough it will tell you what you want to hear.” Computer models simply automate the process of data abuse.\n\nMore impressive, Mark Cane, a climatologist at Columbia University, was the first to predict the current cooling in the Pacific back in 2004, although the implications weren’t clear at the time. “I believe the evidence is pretty clear,” he said. “It’s not about aerosols or stratospheric water vapor; it’s about having had a decade of cooler temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific.”\n\nBut the models do not explain everything says John Fyfe, a climate modeler at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, commenting on the paper by Xie and Kosaka. “What it skirted was the question of what is driving the tropical cooling.”\n\nAssuming the mechanism behind the climate oscillation is the shifting water temperatures in the Pacific, could this mean that the vaunted temperature rise that drove the global warming debate during the 80s and 90s was caused by the ocean dumping heat it had already stored up as part of a natural cycle? Once the heat was released into the atmosphere it was eventually radiated back into space during a period of relatively high solar activity. In the meantime, the ocean is now doing the reverse, cooling the atmosphere. Reinforcing the cooling trend, scientists report the Sun’s activity is at its lowest for 100 years. Some are even warning of a new “Maunder Minimum” and an accompanying plunge in global temperatures.\n\nHas the Sun gone to sleep? Are we about to swing from global warming to a new Ice Age? Nobody really knows (and if they say they do they are lying). Human climate science is still a crude, inexact practice and its practitioners are a lot less knowledgeable than they let on. Yet the dire warnings continue to flow from the warmist camp, accompanied by demands for more funding for “research.” In reality, the current climate change debate is nothing more than special interest politics competing in the news media for fame and public funding.\n\nNassim Taleb and Constantine Sandis published a paper expounding what they termed the “Skin In The Game Heuristic.” Though aimed primarily at the field of statistics, the author’s posit that anyone making claims or predictions that could profit themselves while bringing harm to others should be held responsible for their actions: “We propose a global and morally mandatory heuristic that anyone involved in an action which can possibly generate harm for others, even probabilistically, should be required to be exposed to some damage, regardless of context.”\n\nTherein lies the problem with global warming research—the predicted damage occurs far in the future, beyond the lifetimes of the scientists yammering on about climate catastrophes on the horizon. If the predictions do not come true, there will still be immense damage of an economic nature—ruined industries and ruined lives because of irrational fear spread by people all long retired and mostly long dead.\n\nWith little threat of contradiction, the inertia of group think—the much ballyhooed consensus—holds fast. John Tooby captured the essence of scientific consensus: “Because intellectuals are densely networked in self-selecting groups whose members’ prestige is linked, we incubate endless, self-serving elite superstitions, with baleful effects.”\n\nOn the other hand, for climate researchers the global warming panic has been a goldmine. Government funds have been showered on researchers at universities and government agencies in an effort to cover politicians’ posteriors. For climate scientists the profits are in the present and the risk of being wrong far in the uncertain future. In short, they have no skin in the game, nothing to lose and everything to gain by pandering to the green lobby and other climate cranks.\n\nFull story",

long rise during the past two centuries which produced many forecasts of imminent doom has leveled off since the late 1990s — as shown by all the major temperature datasets its not something the mainstream wants us to know as it spoils the narrative set by alarmists this pause might not last but it is unexpected — and should spark some reflection on our handling of this — and other shockwave threats update much of this post is dated the debate has evolved since this was posted in october 2012 i suggest skipping to section 9 this gives links to research about the pause and has been updated — showing gradual recognition of the pause by climate scientists including the ipcc and uk met office now discussion has moved to implications of the pause one of the most important questions we face when will the pause in global warming end 25 august 2013 – its a pause not a stop scientists explore causes of the pause in warming perhaps the most important research of the decade 17 january 2014 contents the globe mail breaks the story the new uk met office dataset a prominent climate scientists comments the met office replies global sea surface temperatures the satellite temperature record early articles about the warming pause is this cherrypicking the historical data for more information other studies other chapters in this series vital things to know about climate change other posts about climate science this article has been extensively updated as new information has become available changes have been marked 1 the globe mail breaks the story daily news 13 october 2012 global warming stopped 16 years ago reveals met office report quietly released and here is the chart to prove it globe mail canadas newspaper 13 october 2012 — opening and closing the figures reveal that from the beginning of 1997 until august 2012 there was no discernible rise in aggregate global temperatures this means that the pause in global warming has now lasted for about the same time as the previous period when temperatures rose 1980 to 1996 so lets be clear yes global warming is real and some of it at least has been caused by the co2 emitted by fossil fuels but the evidence is beginning to suggest that it may be happening much slower than the catastrophists have claimed – a conclusion with enormous policy implications please click to read the full story it quotes two climate scientists first professor judith curry chair of the school of earth and atmospheric sciences at the georgia institute of technology deleted see her remarks in section 3 and professor phil jones director of the climate research unit at the university of east anglia he would not normally be expected to agree with her yet on two important points he did the data does suggest a plateau he admitted and without a major el nino event – the sudden dramatic warming of the southern pacific which takes place unpredictably and always has a huge effect on global weather – it could go on for a while like prof curry prof jones also admitted that the climate models were imperfect we dont fully understand how to input things like changes in the oceans and because we dont fully understand it you could say that natural variability is now working to suppress the warming we dont know what natural variability is doing he insisted that 15 or 16 years is not a significant period pauses of such length had always been expected he said yet in 2009 when the plateau was already becoming apparent and being discussed by scientists he told a colleague in one of the climategate emails bottom line the no upward trend has to continue for a total of 15 years before we get worried but although that point has now been passed he said that he hadnt changed his mind about the models gloomy predictions i still think that the current decade which began in 2010 will be warmer by about 017 degrees than the previous one which was warmer than the nineties only if that did not happen would he seriously begin to wonder whether something more profound might be happening in other words though five years ago he seemed to be saying that 15 years without warming would make him worried that period has now become 20 years jones said something similar to the bbc on 13 february 2010 2 the new uk met office dataset the uk met office released the hadcrut4110 aprox 3 september 2012 this is probably the basis for the daily news story here is a graph using this the latest longterm data from quantifying uncertainties in global and regional temperature change using an ensemble of observational estimates the hadcrut4 data set looking back further into history data shows temperatures substantially rising in the 19th century but the case for attributing that to the small anthropogenic release in co2 is quite weak most studies date substantial anthropogenic effects after wwii 1950 for the best project 1960 for the ipcc for more information see this page about globalaverage temperature records by dr peter stott at the met office update see the large july 2013 report by the uk met office about the pause — links in item k of section 9 below 3 a prominent climate scientists comments on the article a reply to the article posted at her website climate etc by professor judith curry chair of the school of earth and atmospheric sciences at the georgia institute of technology she didnt agree with the aspects of the quote attributed to her in the article i agree that 16 years is too short given the timescales of the pdo and amo to separate out natural versus anthropogenic variability but this cuts both ways the warming period between 1980 and 1998 was arguably amped by the pdo and amo here is the text i emailed rose in response to his questions the data confirms the existence of a pause in the warming the impact of this pause within the climate dynamic community has been to focus increased attention on the impact of natural variability particularly the impact of internal multidecadal oscillations in the ocean the new climate model calculations for the ar5 have focused on trying to assess what it would take to accurately simulate these multidecadal ocean oscillations and how predictable they might be these new observations and climate modeling results will hopefully impact the the ipcc ar5 deliberations so that we do not see the same overly confident consensus statements that we saw in the ar4 you might be interested in my recent blog post rs workshop on handling uncertainty in weather climate prediction part i the flawed assumption behind the orthodoxy was that natural variability is merely noise superimposed on the long term trend the natural variability has been shown over the past two decades to have a magnitude that dominates the greenhouse warming signal it is becoming increasingly apparent that our attribution of warming since 1980 and future projections of climate change needs to consider natural internal variability as a factor of fundamental importance i sincerely hope that the ar5 provides an assessment of what we know and what we dont know and areas of disagreement rather than trying to manufacture a consensus climate models are very complex but they are imperfect and incomplete in that context the problem is how people interpret the simulations from climate models in view of the uncertainties and imperfections for context on this issue see these other climate etc posts 4 the met office replies on october 14 the uk met office issued a reply on their blog to the mail here is the money paragraph the linear trend from august 1997 in the middle of an exceptionally strong el nino to august 2012 coming at the tail end of a doubledip la nina is about 003°cdecade amounting to a temperature increase of 005°c over that period but equally we could calculate the linear trend from 1999 during the subsequent la nina and show a more substantial warming as weve stressed before choosing a starting or end point on shortterm scales can be very misleading climate change can only be detected from multidecadal timescales due to the inherent variability in the climate system if you use a longer period from hadcrut4 the trend looks very different for example 1979 to 2011 shows 016°cdecade or 015°cdecade in the ncdc dataset 016°cdecade in giss looking at successive decades over this period each decade was warmer than the previous – so the 1990s were warmer than the 1980s and the 2000s were warmer than both eight of the top ten warmest years have occurred in the last decade over the last 140 years global surface temperatures have risen by about 08oc however within this record there have been several periods lasting a decade or more during which temperatures have risen very slowly or cooled the current period of reduced warming is not unprecedented and 15 year long periods are not unusual repeat during the past 140 years the global surface temperatures have risen by about 08oc 14of not yet the disaster commonly described in the news media as yet not an unusual temperature variation in terms of the past few thousand years of history also its difficult to assess the seriousness of this without know the precision of the estimates measuring global temperature especially sea surfaces for 140 must have quite large error bars also the met office response is technically correct but raises a severe operational problem scientific theories must be falsifiable we should know in advance what data will disprove a models forecast this pause is significant because the major models failed to predict it and because its duration has reached the durations some prominent climate scientists previously said would be significant with no boundary conditions or ones that are extended as theyre reached forecasts of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming become a matter of faith — not science from the comments to this article on the met office blog we agree with mr rose that there has been only a very small amount of warming in the 21st century as stated in our response this is 005 degrees celsius since 1997 equivalent to 003 degrees celsius per decade update a july 2013 report by the met office full acknowledges the pause and discusses possible causes see item k in section 9 below 5 global sea surface temperatures sst the temperature datasets that get the most attention measure land surface temperatures not only are the seas 70 of the earths surface but the oceans are the primary reservoir of heat for the coupled seaair system in which we live unfortunately we dont have good historical data for this purpose before roughly 1982 there are several datasets of accurate global sst data after the early 1980s for details see bob tisdales an overview of sea surface temperature datasets used in global temperature products here is a graph of noaa sea surface temperature data from bob tisdales website which combines both direct measurements ie ships and buoys and satellite data again no warming since the late 1990s ssts show the effect of the large decadalscale cycles eg la nina – el nino in the tropical pacific which effect global temperatures the argo project a network of hightech buoys fully deployed in 2007 now provides high quality data of global ocean temperatures at various depths this will answer many questions about climate dynamics and allow development of better models for more information see 6 the satellite temperature record satellite data is often described by nonexperts as the definitive source of global temperatures its not that simple as explained in this article by the national institute of standards and technology nist 6 february 2012 satellites do not measure temperature directly instead they measure the amount of radiation incident on their sensors at various key wavelengths and sometimes polarizations associated with different meteorological phenomena and different sections of the atmosphere or surface those data are then processed by different groups using various methods to yield temperature equivalents also adjustments must be made for sensor decay change of satellite orbits and replacement of satellites there are three major datasets the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa remote sensing systems rss data from nasa satellites and the university of alabama at huntsville uah

the temperature time series for the past two decades is the first decade of the 21st century the warmest in the past 100 years as per peter gleicks argument yes but the very small positive trend is not consistent with the expectation of 02cdecade provided by the ipcc ar4 in terms of anticipating temperature change in the coming decades the agw dominated prediction of 02cdecade does not seem like a good bet particularly with the prospect of reduced solar radiation has there been any warming since 1997 jonathan leakes question there has been slight warming during the past 15 years is it cherry picking to start a trend analysis at 1998 no not if you are looking for a long period of time where there is little or no warming in efforts to refute hypothesis i and none of this data analysis is very satisfying or definitive owing to deficiencies in the data sets particularly over the ocean 9 for more information other studies this will be updated as more appear note the surge of articles about the pause starting in 2010 they come in two kinds once assesses the statistical significance of the pause the second attempt to explain the pause in terms of known climate models while significant these are exercises in fitting — matching the models to new data — and do not validate the models as would successful predictions a is the climate warming or cooling daid r easterling and michael f wehner geophysical research letters april 2009 — one of the earliest articles waving the pause away as insignificant excerpt it is true that if we fit a linear trend line to the annual global landocean surface air temperature smith et al 2005 shown in figure 1 for the period 1998 to 2008 there is no real trend even though global temperatures remain well above the longterm average the unusually strong 19971998 el niño contributed to unusual warmth in the global temperature for 1998 at the start of this period resulting in only a small statistically insignificant positive trend however if we fit a trend line to the same annual global landocean temperatures for the 19771985 period or the 19811989 period we also get no trend even though these periods are em bedded in the

imperative for climate change planning tracking earths global energy kevin e trenberth current opinion in environmental sustainability october 2009 — commendable clear statement of the question opening the global mean temperature in 2008 was the lowest since about 2000 given that there is continual heating of the planet referred to as radiative forcing by accelerating increases of carbon dioxide and other greenhouses due to human activities why isnt the temperature continuing to go up the stock answer is that natural variability plays a key role and there was a major la niña event early in 2008 that led to the month of january having the lowest anomaly in global temperature since 2000 while this is true it is an incomplete explanation in particular what are the physical processes from an energy standpoint there should be an explanation that accounts for where the radiative forcing has gone was it compensated for temporarily by changes in clouds or aerosols or other changes in atmospheric circulation that allowed more radiation to escape to space was it because a lot of heat went into melting arctic sea ice or parts of greenland and antarctica and other glaciers was it because the heat was buried in the ocean and sequestered perhaps well below the surface was it because the la niña led to a change in tropical ocean currents and rearranged the configuration of ocean heat perhaps all of these things are going on but surely we have an adequate system to track whether this is the case or not dont we well it seems that the answer is no we do not but we should e does the global warming pause in the last decade 19992008 shaowu wang et al advances in climate change research issue 1 2010 — abstract issues related to the pause of global warming in the last decade are reviewed it is indicated that the decade of 19992008 is still the warmest of the last 30 years though the global temperature increment is near zero natural factors such as volcanism solar radiation enso and thermohaline circulation can have impact on the interannual and interdecadal variability of global mean temperatures however it will not mask the global warming trend for a long

solomon et al science 5 march 2010 — gated open copy here opening over the past century global average surface temperatures have warmed by about 075°c much of the warming occurred in the past halfcentury over which the average decadal rate of change was about 013°c largely due to anthropogenic increases in wellmixed greenhouse gases however the trend in global surface temperatures has been nearly flat since the late 1990s despite continuing increases in the forcing due to the sum of the wellmixed greenhouse gases co2ch4 halocarbons and n2o raising questions regarding the understanding of forced climate change its drivers the parameters that define natural internal variability and how fully these terms are represented in climate models here we use a combination of data and models to show that stratospheric water vapor very likely made substantial contributions to the flattening of the global warming trend since about 2000 g climate science decadal predictions in demand mark a cane nature geoscience 21 march 2010 — free copy here red emphasis added over the past decade the mean global temperature did not rise much if at all this pause in global warming can not be attributed to cutbacks in greenhousegas emissions by the planets human population so it must be nature taking a turn towards colder temperatures the extent to which such natural climate variability can be predicted on decadal timescales is not known creating useful climate predictions is not straightforward the miami workshop turned the attention of both climate scientists and stakeholders to decadal predictions of climate a field that is still in its infancy if not prenatal decadal climate predictions aim to cover the gap between seasonal to interannual prediction with lead times of two years or less and projections of climate change a century ahead therefore the hope for useful skill in predicting natural variability is far from assured the climate system is chaotic and it is not known how predictable decadal variations are even if we had perfect models and sufficient observations to determine the initial state with high precision perhaps there is something special about a decadal timescale that affords predictability but perhaps not decadal variability may just be the part of a featureless spectrum of frequencies that we happen to pick out of our instrumental records because they are only about 150 years long several valuable efforts to extend the record with palaeoproxy data were reported l stott univ southern california usa b horton univ pennsylvania usa p swart and h wanless univ miami usa but these data are still too sparse and uncertain to allow a firm assessment as one example according to the current leading idea the atlantic multidecadal oscillation is generated by atmospheric noise e schneider center for ocean land atmospheregeorge mason univ usa if indeed random processes are at the heart of decadal variability as strongly supported by the talk of c deser national center for atmospheric research usa this might seem to doom hopes for decadal predictability however the possibility remains that once underway the evolution of important patterns of variability could be projected forward demand for accurate decadal prediction is running ahead of supply this imbalance challenges us to determine how much of the natural climate variability that will contribute substantially to global climate in the next few decades is predictable even if it turns out that climate is essentially not predictable at a decadal scale projections of future climate will be misleading unless we gain a fuller understanding of the range of natural variability in store for us in a warmer world h the role of natural climatic variation in perturbing the observed global mean temperature trend barrie g hunt climate dynamics february 2011 — gated abstract controversy continues to prevail concerning the reality of anthropogenicallyinduced climatic warming one of the principal issues is the cause of the hiatus in the current global warming trend there appears to be a widely held view that climatic change warming should exhibit an inexorable upwards trend a view that implies there is no longer any input by climatic variability in the existing climatic system the relative roles of climatic change and climatic variability are examined here using the same coupled global climatic model for the former the model is run using a specified co2 growth scenario while the latter consisted of a multimillennial simulation where any climatic variability was attributable solely to internal processes within the climatic system it is shown that internal climatic variability can produce global mean surface temperature anomalies of ±025 k and sustained positive and negative anomalies sufficient to account for the anomalous warming of the 1940s as well as the present hiatus in the observed global warming the characteristics of the internallyinduced negative temperature anomalies are such that if this internal natural variability is the cause of the observed hiatus then a resumption of the observed global warming trend is to be expected within the next few years i reconciling anthropogenic climate change with observed temperature 1998–2008 robert k kaufmann et at proceedings of the national academy of science 19 july 2011 — abstract given the widely noted increase in the warming effects of rising greenhouse gas concentrations it has been unclear why global surface temperatures did not rise between 1998 and 2008 we find that this hiatus in warming coincides with a period of little increase in the sum of anthropogenic and natural forcings declining solar insolation as part of a normal elevenyear cycle and a cyclical change from an el nino to a la nina dominate our measure of anthropogenic effects because rapid growth in shortlived sulfur emissions partially offsets rising greenhouse gas concentrations as such we find that recent global temperature records are consistent with the existing understanding of the relationship among global surface temperature internal variability and radiative forcing which includes anthropogenic factors with well known warming and cooling effects j modelbased evidence of deepocean heat uptake during surfacetemperature hiatus periods gerald a meehl et al nature climate change october 2011 –examines 10year long pauses abstract there have been decades such as 2000–2009 when the observed globally averaged surfacetemperature time series shows little positive or even slightly negative trend a hiatus perio d however the observed energy imbalance at the topofatmosphere for this recent decade indicates that a net energy flux into the climate system of about 1w m2 should be producing warming somewhere in the system here we analyse 21stcentury climatemodel simulations that maintain a consistent radiative imbalance at the topofatmosphere of about 1w m2 as observed for the past decade eight decades with a slightly negative global mean surfacetemperature trend show that the ocean above 300m takes up significantly less heat where as the ocean below 300m takes up significantly more compared with nonhiatus decades the model provides a plausible depiction of processes in the climate system causing the hiatus periods and indicates that a hiatus period is a relatively common climate phenomenon and may be linked to la niñalike conditions k global warming humaninduced carbon emissions and their uncertainties jing yun fang et al science china – earth science october 2011 — free copy here abstract in recent decades there have been a number of debates on climate warming and its driving forces based on an extensive literature review we suggest that climate warming occurs with great uncertainty in the magnitude of the temperature increase both human activities and natural forces contribute to climate change but their relative contributions are difficult to quantify and the dominant role of the increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases including co 2 in the global warming claimed by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc is questioned by the scientific communities because of large uncertainties in the mechanisms of natural factors and anthropogenic activities and in the sources of the increased atmospheric co 2 concentration more efforts should be made in order to clarify these uncertainties l separating signal and noise in atmospheric temperature changes the importance of timescale ben santer et al journal of geophysical research atmospheres 18 november 2011 because of the pronounced effect of interannual noise on decadal trends a multi‐model ensemble of anthropogenically‐forced simulations displays many 10‐year periods with little warming a single decade of observational tlt temperature of the lower troposphere data is therefore inadequate for identifying a slowly evolving anthropogenic warming signal our results show that temperature records of at least 17 years in length are required for identifying human effects on global‐mean tropospheric temperature m deducing multidecadal anthropogenic global warming trends using multiple regression analysis jiansong zhou and kakit tung journal of the atmospheric sciences january 2013 — free abstract article is gated potentially important conclusion when the amo is included in addition to the other explanatory variables such as enso volcano and solar influences commonly included in the multiple linear regression analysis the recent 50year and 32year anthropogenic warming trends are reduced by a factor of at least two there is no statistical evidence of a recent slowdown of global warming nor is there evidence of accelerated warming since the mid20th century abstract in order to unmask the anthropogenic global warming trend imbedded in the climate data multiple linear regression analysis is often employed to filter out shortterm fluctuations caused by el ninosouthern oscillation enso volcano aerosols and solar forcing these fluctuations are unimportant as far as their impact on the deduced multidecadal anthropogenic trends is concerned enso and volcano aerosols have very little multidecadal trend solar variations do have a secular trend but it is very small and uncertain what is important but is left out of all multiple regression analysis of global warming so far is a longperioded oscillation called the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo when the amo index is included as a regressor ie explanatory variable the deduced multidecadal anthropogenic global warming trend is so impacted that previously deduced anthropogenic warming rates need to be substantially revised the deduced net anthropogenic global warming trend has been remarkably steady and statistically significant for the past 100 years n global temperature update through 2012 james hansen m sato r ruedy 15 january 2013 an update through 2012 of our global analysis 1 reveals 2012 as having practically the same temperature as 2011 significantly lower th an the maximum reached in 2010 these shortterm global fluctuations are associated principally with natural oscillations of tropical pacific sea surface temperatures summarized in the nino index in the lower part of the figure o retrospective prediction of the global warming slowdown in the past decade by virginie guemas francisco j doblasreyes isabel andreuburillo and muhammad asif nature climate change 7 april 2013 — abstract despite a sustained production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases the earths mean nearsurface temperature paused its rise during the 2000–2010 period to explain such a pause an increase in ocean heat uptake below the superficial ocean layer has been proposed to overcompensate for the earths heat storage contributions have also been suggested from the deep prolonged solar minimum the stratospheric water vapour the stratospheric and tropospheric aerosols however a robust attribution of this warming slowdown has not been achievable up to now here we show successful retrospective predictions of this warming slowdown up to 5 years ahead the analysis of which allows us to attribute the onset of this slowdown to an increase in ocean heat uptake sensitivity experiments accounting only for the external radiative forcings do not reproduce the slowdown the topofatmosphere net energy input remained in the 05–1 w m−2 interval during the past decade which is successfully captured by our predictions most of this excess energy was absorbed in the top 700 m of the ocean at the onset of the warming pause 65 of it in the tropical pacific and atlantic oceans our results hence point at the key role of the ocean heat uptake in the recent warming slowdown the ability to predict retrospectively this slowdown not only strengthens our confidence in the robustness of our climate models but also enhances the socioeconomic relevance of operational decadal climate predictions p strengthening of ocean heat uptake efficiency associated with the recent climate hiatus masahiro watanabe et al geophysical research letters 28 june 2013 — abstract the rate of increase of globalmean surface air temperature satg has apparently slowed during the last decade we investigated the extent to which stateoftheart general circulation models gcms can capture this hiatus period by using multimodel ensembles of historical climate simulations while the satg linear trend for the last decade is not captured by their ensemble means regardless of differences in model generation and external forcing it is barely represented by an 11member ensemble of a gcm suggesting an internal origin of the hiatus associated with active heat uptake by the oceans besides we found

biggest mysteries in climate science humans are pumping more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere today than ever before yet global temperatures have not risen much in more than a decade that trend does not undermine the idea that greenhouse gases will eventually push global temperatures into uncharted territory but it does have scientists puzzled with the stalled warming now approaching its 15th year researchers are seeking some deeper explanation the heat must be going somewhere says ed hawkins a climate scientist at the university of reading uk the question is where scientists can not yet fully explain the recent trends and the larger question is whether the lack of warming today portends less warming in the future r the uk met office discusses the pause these are large pdfs july 2013 excerpt the recent pause in global surface warming is shown in figure 1 in the context of historical observations following a period of rapid warming since the 1970s there has been little further warming of the surface particularly over the ocean in the most recent 10 to 15 years it is clear that there have been other periods with little or no surface warming in the relatively recent past a good example being the period between the 1940s and the 1970s the start of the current pause is difficult to determine precisely although 1998 is often quoted as the star t of the current pause this was an exceptionally warm year because of the largest el niño in the instrumental record this was followed by a strong la niña event and a fall in global surface temperature of around 02 o c equivalent in magnitude to the average decadal warming trend in recent decades it is only really since 2000 that the rise in global surface temperatures has paused s recent global warming hiatus tied to equatorial pacific surface cooling yu kosaka and shangping xie nature 29 august 2013 — gated see this analysis by judith curry prof climate science ga inst tech abstract despite the continued increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations the annualmean global temperature has not risen in the twentyfirst century challenging the prevailing view that anthropogenic forcing causes climate warming various mechanisms have been proposed for this hiatus in global warming but their relative importance has not been quantified hampering observational estimates of climate sensitivity here we show that accounting for recent cooling in the eastern equatorial pacific reconciles climate simulations and observations we present a novel method of uncovering mechanisms for global temperature change by prescribing in addition to radiative forcing the observed history of sea surface temperature over the central to eastern tropical pacific in a climate model although the surface temperature prescription is limited to only 82 of the global surface our model reproduces the annualmean global temperature remarkably well with correlation coefficient r 097 for 1970–2012 which includes the current hiatus and a period of accelerated global warming moreover our simulation captures major seasonal and regional characteristics of the hiatus including the intensified walker circulation the winter cooling in northwestern north america and the prolonged drought in the southern usa our results show that the current hiatus is part of natural climate variability tied specifically to a laniñalike decadal cooling although similar decadal hiatus events may occur in the future the multidecadal warming trend is very likely to continue with greenhouse gas increase t

warming trend over the last 10–15 years there is medium confidence that the trend difference between models and observations during 1998–2 012 is to a substantial degree cause d by internal variability with possible contributions from forcing error and some models overestimating the response to increasing greenhousegas forcing a more detailed discussion appears on pp 2832 in box 92 climate models and the hiatus in globalmean surface warming of the past 15 years they put the pause in a larger context even with this hiatus in gmst trend the decade of the 2000s has been the warmest in the instrumental record of gmst nevertheless the occurrence of the hiatus in gmst trend during the past 15 years raises the two related questions of what has caused it and whether climate models are able to reproduce it this difference between simulated and observed trends could be caused by some combination of internal climate variability missing or incorrect radiative forcing and model response error these potential sources of the difference which are not mutually exclusive are assessed below as is the cause of the observed gmst trend hiatus in summary the observed recent warming hiatus defi ned as the reduction in gm st trend during 1998–2012 as compared to the trend during 1951–2012 is attributable in roughly equal measure to a cooling contribution from internal variability and a reduced trend in external forcing expert judgment medium confidence the forcing trend reduction is primarily due to a negative forcing trend from both volcanic eruptions and the downward phase of the solar cycle however there is low confidence in quantifying the role of forcing trend in causing the hiatus because of uncertainty in the magnitude of the volcanic forcing trend and low

            "text": "Still good news: global temperatures remain stable, at least for now.\n\nSummary:  Today we look at good news (rarely seen here), the stabilization of global temperatures. The long rise during the past two centuries, which produced many forecasts of imminent doom, has leveled off since the late 1990s — as shown by all the major temperature datasets.  It’s not something the mainstream wants us to know, as it spoils the narrative set by alarmists.  This pause might not last, but it is unexpected — and should spark some reflection on our handling of this — and other shockwave threats.\n\n\n\n.\n\nUpdate: much of this post is dated. The debate has evolved since this was posted in October 2012. I suggest skipping to section 9. This gives links to research about the pause, and has been updated — showing gradual recognition of the pause by climate scientists, including the IPCC and UK Met Office. Now discussion has moved to implications of the pause:\n\nContents\n\nThis article has been extensively updated as new information has become available.  Changes have been marked.\n\n(1)  The Globe & Mail breaks the story!\n\n“Global warming stopped 16 years ago, reveals Met Office report quietly released, and here is the chart to prove it“, Globe & Mail (“Canada’s newspaper”), 13 October 2012 — Opening and closing:\n\nPlease click to read the full story. It quotes two climate scientists.  First Professor Judith Curry, Chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology:\n\n.\n\nAnd Professor Phil Jones, director of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia:\n\nJones said something similar to the BBC on 13 February 2010.\n\n(2)  The new UK Met Office dataset\n\nThe UK Met Office released the HadCRUT.4.1.1.0 aprox 3 September 2012.  This is probably the basis for the Daily News story.\n\nHere is a graph using this, the latest long-term data, from “Quantifying uncertainties in global and regional temperature change using an ensemble of observational estimates: the HadCRUT4 data set“.  Looking back further into history, data shows temperatures substantially rising in the 19th century, but the case for attributing that to the small anthropogenic release in CO2 is quite weak.  Most studies date substantial anthropogenic effects after WWII: 1950 for the BEST project, 1960 for the IPCC.\n\nFor more information see this page about Global-average temperature records by Dr Peter Stott at the Met Office.\n\nUpdate: see the large July 2013 report by the UK Met Office about the pause — links in item k of section 9 below.\n\n(3)  A prominent climate scientists comments on the article\n\nA reply to the article posted at her website, Climate Etc, by Professor Judith Curry (Chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology). She didn’t agree with the aspects of the quote attributed to her in the article.\n\n(4)  The Met Office replies\n\nOn October 14 the UK Met Office issued a reply on their blog to the Mail.  Here is the money paragraph:\n\nRepeat: “during the past 140 years the global surface temperatures have risen by about 0.8ºC” (1.4ºF).  Not yet the disaster commonly described in the news media; as yet not an unusual temperature variation in terms of the past few thousand years of history.  Also, it’s difficult to assess the seriousness of this without know the precision of the estimates. Measuring global temperature (especially sea surfaces) for 140 must have quite large error bars.\n\nAlso, the Met Office response is technically correct, but raises a severe operational problem: scientific theories must be falsifiable. We should know in advance what data will disprove a model’s forecast.  This pause is significant because the major models failed to predict it, and because it’s duration has reached the durations some prominent climate scientists previously said would be significant.  With no boundary conditions, or ones that are extended as they’re reached, forecasts of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming become a matter of faith — not science.\n\nFrom the comments to this article on the Met Office Blog:\n\nUpdate: a July 2013 report by the Met Office full acknowledges the pause, and discusses possible causes. See item (k) in Section 9 below.\n\nThe temperature datasets that get the most attention measure land surface temperatures. Not only are the seas 70% of the Earth’s surface, but the oceans are the primary reservoir of heat for the coupled sea-air system in which we live. Unfortunately we don’t have good historical data (for this purpose) before roughly 1982.  There are several datasets of accurate global SST data after the early 1980s; for details see Bob Tisdale’s “An Overview Of Sea Surface Temperature Datasets Used In Global Temperature Products“.\n\nHere is a graph of NOAA Sea Surface Temperature data from Bob Tisdale’s website, which combines both direct measurements (ie, ships and buoys) and satellite data)  Again, no warming since the late 1990s.  SST’s show the effect of the large decadal-scale cycles (eg, La Nina – El Nino in the tropical Pacific), which effect global temperatures.\n\nThe Argo project, a network of high-tech buoys fully deployed in 2007, now provides high quality data of global ocean temperatures at various depths.  This will answer many questions about climate dynamics, and allow development of better models.  For more information see:\n\n(6)  The satellite temperature record\n\nSatellite data is often described by non-experts as the definitive source of global temperatures. It’s not that simple, as explained in this article by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 6 February 2012:\n\nAlso, adjustments must be made for sensor decay, change of satellite orbits, and replacement of satellites.\n\nThere are three major datasets:  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Remote Sensing Systems (RSS, data from NASA satellites), and the University of Alabama at Huntsville (UAH).  This graph from the NIST article shows that the recent temperature plateau appears in all three datasets.\n\nHere is the UAH data through August 2012 (source: Roy Spencer, co-developer of the data series):\n\n(7)  Early articles noting the stabilization of global temperatures\n\n(8)   Is this cherry-picking the historical data?\n\nNo, it’s not.  See “Trends, change points & hypotheses“, Judith Curry posted at Climate Etc, 7 February 2012 — Excerpt:\n\nNote the surge of articles about the pause starting in 2010.  They come in two kinds.  Once assesses the statistical significance of the pause.  The second attempt to explain the pause in terms of known climate models.  While significant, these are exercises in fitting — matching the models to new data — and do not validate the models as would successful predictions.\n\n(a)  “Is the climate warming or cooling?“, Daid R. Easterling and Michael F. Wehner, Geophysical Research Letters, April 2009 — One of the earliest articles, waving the pause away as insignificant.

Trenberth, Current Opinion In Environmental Sustainability, October 2009 — Commendable clear statement of the question.  Opening:\n\n(e)  “Does the Global Warming Pause in the Last Decade: 1999-2008?“, Shaowu Wang et al, Advances in Climate Change Research, issue #1 2010 — Abstract:\n\n(f)  “Contributions of Stratospheric Water Vapor to Decadal Changes in the Rate of Global Warming“, Susan Solomon et al, Science, 5 March 2010 — Gated. Open copy here. Opening:\n\n(g)  “Climate science: Decadal predictions in demand“, Mark A. Cane, Nature Geoscience, 21 March 2010 — Free copy here.  Red emphasis added.\n\nOver the past decade, the mean global temperature did not rise much, if at all. This pause in global warming cannot be attributed to cutbacks in greenhouse-gas emissions by the planet’s human population, so it must be nature taking a turn towards colder temperatures. The extent to which such natural climate variability can be predicted on decadal timescales is not known. Creating useful climate predictions is not straightforward. … The Miami workshop turned the attention of both climate scientists and stakeholders to decadal predictions of climate, a field that is still in its infancy (if not prenatal). Decadal climate predictions aim to cover the gap between seasonal to interannual prediction with lead times of two years or less and projections of climate change a century ahead. … Therefore, the hope for useful skill in predicting natural variability is far from assured. The climate system is chaotic and it is not known how predictable decadal variations are, even if we had perfect models and sufficient observations to determine the initial state with high precision. Perhaps there is something special about a decadal timescale that affords predictability, but perhaps not: decadal variability may just be the part of a featureless spectrum of frequencies that we happen to pick out of our instrumental records because they are only about 150 years long. Several valuable efforts to extend the record with palaeoproxy data were reported (L. Stott, Univ. Southern California, USA; B. Horton, Univ. Pennsylvania, USA; P. Swart and H. Wanless, Univ. Miami, USA), but these data are still too sparse and uncertain to allow a firm assessment. As one example, according to the current leading idea, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation is generated by atmospheric noise (E. Schneider, Center for Ocean, Land, Atmosphere/George Mason Univ., USA). If indeed random processes are at the heart of decadal variability, as strongly supported by the talk of C. Deser (National Center for Atmospheric Research, USA), this might seem to doom hopes for decadal predictability. However, the possibility remains that, once underway, the evolution of important patterns of variability could be projected forward. … Demand for accurate decadal prediction is running ahead of supply. This imbalance challenges us to determine how much of the natural climate variability that will contribute substantially to global climate in the next few decades is predictable. Even if it turns out that climate is essentially not predictable at a decadal scale, projections of future climate will be misleading unless we gain a fuller understanding of the range of natural variability in store for us in a warmer world.\n\n(h)  “The role of natural climatic variation in perturbing the observed global mean temperature trend“, Barrie G Hunt, Climate Dynamics, February 2011 — Gated.

nature has a news and views piece entitled climate change the case of the missing heat complete article is available online some excerpts average global temperatures hit a record high in 1998 — and then the warming stalled for several years scientists wrote off the stall as noise in the climate system the natural variations in the atmosphere oceans and biosphere that drive warm or cool spells around the globe but the pause has persisted sparking a minor crisis of confidence in the field although there have been jumps and dips average atmospheric temperatures have risen little since 1998 in seeming defiance of projections of climate models and the everincreasing emissions of greenhouse gases jc comment my my recall david roses article in oct 2012 on the pause claiming that global warming had stopped and the pushback against roses article the pause has now gone mainstream with this article in nature even in the ipcc did its level best to downplay it climate sceptics have seized on the temperature trends as evidence that global warming has ground to a halt climate scientists meanwhile know that heat must still be building up somewhere in the climate system but they have struggled to explain where it is going if not into the atmosphere some have begun to wonder whether there is something amiss in their models jc comment now no one understands the cause of the pause but climate scientists say the heat is hiding in the ocean my next post will be on ocean heat content so im not getting into this here the competing explanation the denier one i guess since i dont hear mainstream climate scientists mentioning this is that the heat never made it into the system possibly related to changing cloud patterns or properties that reflected more solar radiation but none of the climate simulations carried out for the ipcc produced this particular hiatus at this particular time that has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared others say that this conclusion goes against the longterm temperature trends as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past and many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively shortterm blip in the climate jc comment size matters here ie the length of the hiatus depending on when you start counting this hiatus has lasted 16 years climate model simulations find that the probability of a hiatus as long as 20 years is vanishingly small if the 20 year threshold is reached for the pause this will lead inescapably to the conclusion that the climate model sensitivity to co2 is too large further 20 years is approaching the length of the warming period from 19762000 that is the main smoking gun for agw this has led skeptics – and some scientists rather scary that nature does not seem to acknowledge that skepticism is one of the norms of science and regards skeptics and scientists are mutually exclusive groups if you are interested in global climate change your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years says susan solomon a climate scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge jc comment people are interested in climate change on all sorts of time scales including decadal solomon should have stated that if you are interested in the climate response to a longterm secular buildup of greenhouse gases then your main focus should be timescales of 50100 years i agree with this and if you look at the last 100 years you have that other inconvenient pause to explain 19401975 with the reduction in sensitivity to aerosol forcing the aerosol explanation for this earlier pause no longer holds up stadium wave dynamics can explain both the 19401975 and the current hiatus a further inference is that warming of 19762000 was enhanced by natural climate variability this variation in ocean temperature known as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo may be a crucial piece of the hiatus puzzle jc comment i certainly agree that the pdo is probably a crucial piece of the puzzle but one of the quickest ways to get labeled as a denier has been to argue that the pdo in its warm phase contributed to the 19762000 warming you cant keep piling up warm water in the western pacific trenberth says at some point the water will get so high that it just sloshes back and when that happens if scientists are on the right track the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again jc comment well that is an interesting forecast if this is natural internal variability eg the stadium wave which includes the pdo then you would expect warming to resume at some point ive argued this might be in the 2030s this would make the hiatus 30 years similar in length to the pevious hiatus from 1940 to 1975 this is long enough to invalidate the utility of the current climate models for projecting future climate change and about the missing heat reappearing well stay tuned for my next post on ocean heat content other blog posts here are two relevant blog posts worth looking at public opinion chris mooney has an article in mother jones entitled globalwarming denial hits a 6year high excerpts the obvious question is what happened over the last year to produce more climate denial according to both anthony leiserowitz of yale and ed maibach of george mason the leaders of the two research teams the answer may well lie in the socalled global warming pause —the misleading idea that global warming has slowed down or stopped over the the past 15 years or so this claim was used by climate skeptics to great effect in their quest to undermine the release of the un intergovernmental panel on climate changes fifth assessment report in september 2013—precisely during the time period that is in question in the latest study as maibachs colleague anthony leiserowitz of yale adds it isnt as though those who were already convinced about global warming became less sure of themselves over the last year rather the change of views really seems to be happening among the dont knows says leiserowitz those are the people who arent paying attention and dont know much about the issue so theyre the most openminded and the most swayable based on recent events journalists take heed your coverage has consequences all those media outlets who trumpeted the global warming pause may now be partly responsible for a documented decrease in americans scientific understanding well if the scientists dont understand the cause of the pause and the public is aware of the pause then exactly what are we to conclude about the public understanding of climate change maybe that the public is not sufficiently sophisticated to believe climate model projections that are running much warmer than observations for the past decade like this like loading

            "text": "by Judith Curry\n\nSixteen years into the mysterious ‘global-warming hiatus’, scientists are piecing together an explanation. – Jeff Tollefson\n\nNature has a News and Views piece entitled Climate Change: The Case of the Missing Heat (complete article is available online).   Some excerpts:\n\nAverage global temperatures hit a record high in 1998 — and then the warming stalled. For several years, scientists wrote off the stall as noise in the climate system: the natural variations in the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere that drive warm or cool spells around the globe. But the pause has persisted, sparking a minor crisis of confidence in the field. Although there have been jumps and dips, average atmospheric temperatures have risen little since 1998, in seeming defiance of projections of climate models and the ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nJC comment:  My, my.  Recall David Rose’s article in Oct 2012 on the pause, claiming that global warming had stopped, and the pushback against Rose’s article.  The pause has now gone mainstream with this article in Nature, even in the IPCC did its level best to downplay it.\n\nClimate sceptics have seized on the temperature trends as evidence that global warming has ground to a halt.  Climate scientists, meanwhile, know that heat must still be building up somewhere in the climate system, but they have struggled to explain where it is going, if not into the atmosphere. Some have begun to wonder whether there is something amiss in their models.\n\nJC comment:  Now, no one understands the cause of the pause, but  climate scientists say the heat is hiding in the ocean.  My next post will be on ocean heat content, so I’m not getting into this here.  The competing explanation (the ‘denier’ one, I guess since I don’t hear mainstream climate scientists mentioning this) is that the heat never made it into the system, possibly related to changing cloud patterns or properties that reflected more solar radiation.\n\nBut none of the climate simulations carried out for the IPCC produced this particular hiatus at this particular time. That has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases, and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared. Others say that this conclusion goes against the long-term temperature trends, as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past. And many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively short-term blip in the climate.\n\nJC comment:  Size matters here, i.e. the length of the hiatus.  Depending on when you start counting, this hiatus has lasted 16 years.  Climate model simulations find that the probability of a hiatus as long as 20 years is vanishingly small.  If the 20 year threshold is reached for the pause, this will lead inescapably to the conclusion that the climate model sensitivity to CO2 is too large.  Further, 20 years is approaching the length of the warming period from 1976-2000 that is the main smoking gun for AGW.\n\nThis has led skeptics – and some scientists - . . .    Rather scary that Nature does not seem to acknowledge that skepticism is one of the norms of science, and regards ‘skeptics’ and ‘scientists’ are mutually exclusive groups.\n\n“If you are interested in global climate change, your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years,” says Susan Solomon, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.\n\nJC comment:  People are interested in climate change on all sorts of time scales, including decadal.  Solomon should have stated that if you are interested in the climate response to a long-term secular buildup of greenhouse gases, then your main focus should be timescales of 50-100 years.  I agree with this.  And if you look at the last 100 years, you have that other inconvenient pause to explain: 1940-1975.  With the reduction in sensitivity to aerosol forcing, the aerosol explanation for this earlier pause no longer holds up.  Stadium wave dynamics can explain both the 1940-1975 and the current hiatus; a further inference is that warming of 1976-2000 was enhanced by natural climate variability.\n\nThis variation in ocean temperature, known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), may be a crucial piece of the hiatus puzzle.\n\nJC comment:  I certainly agree that the PDO is probably a crucial piece of the puzzle, but one of the quickest ways to get labeled as a ‘denier’ has been to argue that the PDO in its warm phase contributed to the 1976-2000 warming.\n\n“You can’t keep piling up warm water in the western Pacific,” Trenberth says. “At some point, the water will get so high that it just sloshes back.” And when that happens, if scientists are on the right track, the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again.\n\nJC comment: Well that is an interesting ‘forecast.’   If this is natural internal variability, e.g. the stadium wave (which includes the PDO), then you would expect warming to resume at some point (I’ve argued this might be in the 2030’s).  This would make the hiatus 30+ years (similar in length to the pevious hiatus from 1940 to 1975).  This is long enough to invalidate the utility of the current climate models for projecting future climate change.\n\nAnd about the missing heat reappearing, well stay tuned for my next post on ocean heat content.\n\nOther blog posts\n\nHere are two relevant blog posts worth looking at.\n\nPublic Opinion\n\nChris Mooney has an article in Mother Jones entitled Global-Warming Denial Hits a 6-Year High.  Excerpts:\n\nThe obvious question is, what happened over the last year to produce more climate denial?\n\nAccording to both Anthony Leiserowitz of Yale and Ed Maibach of George Mason, the leaders of the two research teams, the answer may well lie in the so-called global warming “pause”—the misleading idea that global warming has slowed down or stopped over the the past 15 years or so. This claim was used by climate skeptics, to great effect, in their quest to undermine the release of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report in September 2013—precisely during the time period that is in question in the latest study.\n\nAs Maibach’s colleague Anthony Leiserowitz of Yale adds, it isn’t as though those who were already convinced about global warming became less sure of themselves over the last year. Rather, the change of views “really seems to be happening among the ‘don’t knows,'” says Leiserowitz. “Those are the people who aren’t paying attention, and don’t know much about the issue. So they’re the most open-minded, and the most swayable based on recent events.”\n\nJournalists take heed: Your coverage has consequences. All those media outlets whotrumpeted the global warming “pause” may now be partly responsible for a documented decrease in Americans’ scientific understanding.\n\nWell, if the scientists don’t understand the cause of the pause, and the public is aware of the pause, then exactly what are we to conclude about the public understanding of climate change?  Maybe that the public is not sufficiently ‘sophisticated’ to believe climate model projections that are running much warmer than observations for the past decade?",

to prove man is causing global warming is rock solid and not open to debate it is not in fact the data is so fraudulent and corrupted that it should never be used to justify cap and trade legislation yet that is exactly what is happening these are just a few of the examples of fraud so far in 2014 record low temperatures outpace record highs nearly 21 in the usa wuwt july 31 2014 numbers released today by noaa�s national climatic data center show that not only has july been abnormally cool in the usa but so has 2014 in general for the last 30 days there have been 574 record highest temperatures in the usa and 1726 record lowest a ratio of 3 to 1 indicating that july was very cool but the year so far has also been cool so far for the usa year to date the numbers of record lows outpace the highs two to one note in sharp contrast to noaa�s claim that april through june broke warm temperature records using their �adjusted� data that is proven to greatly inflate current temperatures while depressing 20 th century temperatures actual records show new cold records for either high or low temperatures outstrip warm records by 2 to 1 in 2014 noaa�s claim to global warming is nothing more than a statistical artifact they created not reality whats wrong with cap and trade an overview by kristie pelletier of the science and climate models of global warming the models are wrong and there has been natural warming and cooling for thousands of years cap and trade legislation is not needed report the chain of environmental command july 30 2014 must read the explosive us senate report highlights the collusion between environmental activists the epa and billionaires using large sums of money 79 billion annually to influence environmental public policy through the environmental grantmakers assoc ega the obama administration has installed an audacious greenrevolving door among senior officials at epa so that former environmentalists working at epa funnel government money through grants to their former employers and colleagues note weve known about this collusion since the very early 1990s and have a set of audio tapes of the egas 1992 meeting they would curl your hair like the epa environmentalists are no friends to humanity and as the findings show are in the pockets of the global elite who are using environmentalism to destroy the us so they can institute global governance cap and trade insanity cap and trade legislation in the us senate will destroy the american way of lifeforever it puts the government in charge of our economy it forces the use of renewable wind and solar energy which have serious problems we are not being told about neither are economically feasible with todays technology and will cost trillions of dollars the same strategy in spain has resulted in huge job losses and escalating costs to spanish consumers study only 375 of atmospheric co2 is manmade from burning fossil fuels climate depot july19 2014 a paper published today in atmospheric chemistry and physics finds that only about 375 15 ppm of the co2 in the lower atmosphere is manmade from the burning of fossil fuels and thus the vast remainder of the 400 ppm atmospheric co2 is from landuse changes and natural sources such as ocean outgassing and plant respiration the findings are in stark contrast to alarmist claims that essentially all of the alleged 130 ppm parts per million increase in co2 since preindustrial times is of manmade origin from the burning of fossil fuels finding instead that only 15 ppm or 115 of the increase is of fossil fuel origin note if these findings are confirmed it would blow the entire mancaused theory out of the water expect a blistering attack by the greens on these authors and their findings most if not all with be smear attacks without facts or if they attempt to use facts they will be based in pseudoscience the crippling cost although congress tells us that the cap and trade legislation will only cost an average family less than 200 a year that is just wrong very wrong it is the biggest tax increase in the history of the united states but congress is hiding it so you cant see it analyses done by independent organizations shows that it will cost families many thousands of dollars a year and will drastically lower our standard of living it hits the poor especially hard even with federal rebates should you trust noaas claims about mayjune records wupt july 28 2014 last month was the hottest june since record keeping began in 1880 the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa said monday it marked the third month in a row that global temperature reached a record high however as we have shown here the warming is all in the questionable adjustments made to the data with a major cooling of the past and allowance for uhi contamination in recent decades the all time record highs and days over 90f tell us we have been in a cyclical pattern with 1930s as the warmest decade note finally skeptics are challenging how noaa and the data masters manipulate their data to create artificial global warming the article then expands to discuss how the f the un ipcc fraud the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change is supposed to be the last word on unbiased science concerning global warming in fact the ipcc stifles any science that contradicts its mancaused mantra it must not be used to justify cap and trade legislation weather channel founder debunks global warming hoax american prosperity july 2014 john coleman an awardwinning meteorologist with 60 years of experience and founder of the weather channel has produced a video explaining the history of the manmade global warming hoax coleman explains that any socalled �climate change� is extremely negligible from a longterm perspective and nothing unusual or alarming he points out that antarctic sea ice is close to an alltime high and the polar bear population is as high as it�s been in recorded history the carbon footprint carbon dioxide is not can not be a pollutant it is a miracle gas that is essential for life on earth and was ten times more abundant in geologic history kristie pelletier explains that increased levels of carbon dioxide has been a blessing to ecosystems and food production no free rein for the epa the hill july 2 2014 important an constitutional attorney part of the recent supreme court decision on the epa explains the decision goes much further than previously thought the decision clearly rains in the agency from what has become a pattern of regulatory overreach this will prove to be a heavy blow to the epa�s future plans to regulate carbon more than 6 million buildings and facilities potentially would now need permits under epas new regs this included schools churches apartment buildings and everything in between which even the epa recognized would be absurd the epa had another solution tailor the statute � or essentially rewrite it � to increase permitting levels to target major facilities like power plants while reserving authority to tighten thresholds over time so that an increasing number of buildings and facilities ultimately would be required to obtain permits the court told the epa that basic separation of powers principles do not permit executive branch agencies to rewrite duly enacted laws the court therefore struck down the tailoring rule holding that it would be patently unreasonable � not to say outrageous � for the epa to insist on seizing expansive power to rewrite congressional enactments note i have warned of epas rewrite in range magazine for 2 years although early reports of the courts ruling seemed to suggest limited curtailment of the epas rules on carbon it now appears the court really clipped the wings of epas continuous attempts to become the high priest of the us if so it is a real win for every american failure of climate models leading international scientists explain why mancaused global

deliberately trying to destroy our economy alarm over climate turns people off london times june 24 2014 alarmist claims about the impact of global warming are contributing to a loss of trust in climate scientists an inquiry has found apocalyptic language has been used about greenhouse gas emissions as �a deliberate strategy by some to engage public interest� however trying to make people reduce emissions by frightening them has �harmful consequences� because they often respond suspiciously or decide the issue is �too scary to think about�� the inquiry concludes �alarmist messages that fail to materialise contribute to the loss of trust in the science community� note it is a wonder anyone still believes in global warming the federal government and their progressive lapdogs excepted so many catastrophic predictions have been made�some given 20 years ago and supposed to be happening now�that have never materialized and science that has been proven bogus that no one should believe

are in a special category in the public�s mind since they are perceived to have specialized knowledge that it is assumed will benefit society in general and more importantly the individual concerned with his own wellbeing the government has now assumed the mantle of protector and can prophesize that the new clean air regulations specifically targeting carbon dioxide �carbon pollution� will prevent �150000 asthma attacks in children each year and 20000 heart attacks� forestall dangerous climate change hold back sealevel rise and prevent global warming the lack of valid supporting scientific facts to make such claims is ignored as political dogma has marginalized and even punished scientific dissent note global warming and epa science used to justify horrendous regulations is no longer even pseudoscience most of it is made up out of thin air or other science refuting it never sees the light of day no civilization can survive this us climate reference network shows the temperature pause wuwt june 8 2014 the us climate reference network provides the most accurate surface temperature network in the world not only is there a pause in the posited temperature rise from alleged manmade global warming but a clearly evident slight cooling trend in the us average temperature over nearly the last decade there is a slight cooling in maximum temperatures and the heat wave events seen in 2006 and 2012 were isolated weather incidents and not part of the near decadal trend a cooling trend of almost 1 o f in the minimum temperatures across the contiguous united states for nearly a decade note this very accurate data set should prove that we have had a pause maybe even a decline in earths temperature since 2005 when the network first went into effect it wont though because this is not about science but politics climate policy and the poor global warming policy foundation june 5 2014 measures currently being taken to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels are directly harming the poor both in the developing and in the developed world energy sources that are not based on fossil fuels make power and food � both of vital importance for the poor � more expensive and more difficult to obtain the environment may be preserved by many actions without placing prime emphasis on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in the long term the human race may have to replace fossil fuels as an energy source but not at present note apparently obamas love affair with the poor extends only to those issues that gives him more power otherwise he doesnt care about the poor germany prepares to allow fracking financial times june 5 2014 germany is set to lift its ban on fracking as early as next year after caving in to business demands that it should reduce its dependency on russian energy and boost competitiveness with us manufacturers fracking has been the subject of a fierce debate in germany�s ruling coalition with some politicians keen to reduce reliance on russian energy imports while others fear the impact of fracking chemicals on a densely populated country germany�s estimated reserves of shale gas are significantly smaller than those of poland and france however german shale gas which is concentrated in its northern states still has the potential to provide a longterm domestic supply note about half of europes population are rabid socialists who are afraid of their shadow however the ukraine crisis and the threat of bankrupting business and the nation have seemed to force the issue to favor fracking in germany expect england to follow suit next uk energy security myth and reality gwpf june 2 2014 germany provides a warning example of its growing green energy insecurity last december both wind and solar power came to an almost complete halt for more than a week more than 23000 wind turbines stood still while one million photovoltaic systems failed to generate energy due to a lack of sunshine for a whole week conventional power plants had to provide almost all of germany�s electricity supply germans woke up to the fact that it was the complete failure of renewable energy to deliver that undermined the stability and security of germany�s electricity system note this is what the us has to look for as obama forces us to depend on more wind and solar energy it is absolutely insane what happened in germany and england last year is reality people could have died if coal fired plants had already been torn down obama�s big epa announcement tomorrow translates directly to higher electricity prices

president barack obama will propose cutting greenhousegas emissions from the nation�s power plants by an average of 30 percent from 2005 levels � he�s living in a fantasy world note thats an understatement especially when australia is abandoning all of its green initiatives and europe is abandoning them as fast as possible alternative energy is proving to be a total failure without huge government subsidies obama is still pedal to the medal what world does he live on germanys green jobs miracle collapses global warming policy foundation may 28 2014 renewable energy was supposed to

academic advisory boardglobal warming policy foundation was greeted with fury by many fellow climate scientists now in a mccarthyite move � his analogy � they have bullied him into resigning by refusing to collaborate with him unless he leaves lord lawson said in a recent speech �i have never in my life experienced the extremes of personal hostility vituperation and vilification that i along with other dissenters of course have received for my views on global warming and globalwarming policies� note like other progressive ideologies global warming is no longer treated as a science it never was but as a religion in which like radical islam seeks to destroy anyone who disagrees with them this will not end well weaker solar activity means colder and colder also means drier wuwt may 14 2014 in effect figure 4 predicts a megadrought for north america from at least 2050 to 2200 generations of people will experience what a dalton minimum is like all their lives in the meantime it will get colder and drier in terms of the effect on agricultural productivity productivity of corn production in the corn belt falls by 10 for each 1�c fall in annual average temperature the corn belt also moves south by 144 km for each 1�c fall in annual average temperature soil quality declines to the south of the corn belt though so farms won�t be as productive note dont panic this article doesnt predict what will happen to earths temperatures but defines what is likely to happen if we are moving towards a dalton minimum no sun spots temps decline by 2 o c it could reduce global food production by 30 this is much much worse than global warming and it has nothing to do with co2 emissions antarctic sea ice at record levels the australian may 12 2014 antarctic sea ice has expanded to record levels for april increasing by more than 110000sq km a day last month to nine million square kilometers the national snow and ice data centre said the rapid expansion had continued into may and the seasonal cover was now bigger than the record �by a significant margin�� note antarctica sea ice continues to get bigger defying the global warming narrative arctic sea ice was still below average in 2013 but was much greater than 2012 some scientists are predicting the arctic minimum will be above average in 2014 we shall see us and europe planning to cut off russias gas supply the independent may 9 2014 us and other european countries are planning to �disarm� the threat of president vladimir putin using russian gas and oil supplies as �a weapon� against ukraine and its eastern european neighbours at the same timea plan to eliminate europe�s reliance on russian oil and gas over the longer term and prevent energy security being used as political bargaining chip by the kremlin note this is the one threat that is probably holding putin back from invading eastern ukraine this is no surprise question where is this european gas going to come from the us will not have any export facilities until 2015 and as i currently understand it europe can only increase production by a small amount whats europe going to do if putin cuts off its gas next winter once again if progressives and socialists had not refused to develop natural gas in the early 2000s this problem with russia would have never arisen national climate assessment report alarmists offer untrue unrelenting doom and gloom wuwt may 6 2014 since even immediate and total shutdown of all carbon dioxideemitting vehicles power plants and factories in the us would decrease global warming by only a hypothetical and undetectable two tenths of a degree celsius by 2100 it is misleading to imply as the report does that the obama administration�s climate policies can provide any measurable protection from extreme weather events the assessment is flat out wrong that climate change is increasing our vulnerability to heat stress as hot weather has become more frequent people and communities have adapted to it and heatrelated mortality in the us has declined note this report is a disgusting propaganda piece their is no attempt at any objectivity literally the truth is opposite anything it says there has been little to no extreme weather for nearly a decade in any category that this administration can put out such a bald faced lie to the american people and get away with it is a very scary condemnation of the deluded citizenry they apparently will believe anything is the ipcc government approval process broken wuwt april 26 2014 from dr robert stavins ipcc lead author a grueling week spent in berlin germany april 513 2014 at the government approval sessions in which some 195 country delegations discussed revised and ultimately approved linebyline the �summary for policymakers� spm which condenses more than 2000 pages of text from 15 chapters into an spm document of 33 pages several of the lead authors present with me in berlin commented that given the nature and outcome of the week the resulting document should probably be called the summary by policymakers rather than the summary for policymakers stavins goes on to describe the systematic deconstruction of the real science in the spm and turned into a political document that has nothing to do with the real science but everything to do with science note finally the real scientists are exposing the enormous ipcc fraud whats happening from the office of michael coffman april 25 2014 many of you are wondering why we havent posted anything for almost two weeks its because we are consumed with digging into the bundy ranch standoff we have gone back two hundred years to follow the paper trail it is stunning even horrifying what this government has done to the citizens of the west the media has totally made hash out of reality and it designed to divert our attention from the truth a series of wellreferenced articles will be posted soon that explains how we got here and how bundys constitutional rights have been violated additionally i have been up to my eyes organizing a major conference in los angeles on the shutoff of water by the feds to farmers in california the federal government is literally at war with its citizens in its lust to subject all of our rights to its dictates if you live in the la area this is a must conference to attend httpwwwamericanfreedomallianceorglectureseriescalifornialandandwaterwarsjsp climate control brain washing in schools global warming policy foundation april 2014 a new report describes how environmentalism has come to permeate school curricula across the uk passing examinations will now usually involve the ability to recite green mantras rather than understanding the subtle questions of science and economics involved the authors review in detail the climate change teaching materials currently used in british schools with disturbing results there is ample evidence of unscientific statements manipulated graphs and activist materials used in class and even found in textbooks note the same thing is happening in the us with common core and the next generation science standards we have reviewed the latter and are stunned at the outright propaganda the standards force textbook companies to include in their textbooks stay tuned is the pacific experiencing another warm el nino wuwt april 7 2014 with the possibility of an el nino developing later this year still considered a 50 there is the possibility of a new record high global temperature if the el nino is sufficiently strong enough i roy spenser phd personally don�t think this is going to happen because we are in the negative phase of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo which favors stronger la nina and weaker el nino of course an el nino at the end of the record will increase the global temperature trend�at least temporarily�but el nino is often followed by a cool la nina which would basically cancel out that effect note heads up if this el nino does occur and the earth warms perhaps to record levels expect the alarmists and the compliant media to proclaim warming has resumed and the earth is going to turn into a cinder if we don�t destroy our economy by limiting fossil fuel emissions stay calm it will be shortlived t he ipccs latest report deliberately excludes and misrepresents important climate science forbes march 31 2014 the latest ipcc working group ii�s contribution to the 5 th assessment report released last december has made headlines of doom and gloom this week the nipcc skeptics report comes out next week the nipcc report shows how �eight reasons for concern� are either totally wrong or over exaggerated this article provides a convenient way to compare and contrast the ipcc�s lies and exaggerations some key points made y nipcc 1 �there is little or no risk of increasing food insecurity due to global warming� 2 �no changes in precipitation patterns snow monsoons or river flows� 3 �higher atmospheric co2 concentrations benefit plant growth�that help land plants overcome drought conditions�that enhance their growth rates and water use efficiencies� 4 �a modest warming of the planet will result in a net reduction of human mortality from temperaturerelated events� note an excellent summary remember the real threat comes from the now likely global cooling hitting hard in 2020 or thereabouts climate changing get used to it and get ready financial post march 31 2014 there are in effect two different worlds at the ipcc the objective is to fan fears of fossilfuelinduced global crises brought on by rising carbon emissions in the rest of the world demand for fossil fuels continues to expand regardless of the carbon risks the existential conflict is personified in john kerry us secretary of state who is now simultaneously warning of the grave dangers posed by climate change while touting expanded us gas exports note of the two issues obama is still favoring the need to cut co2 emissions and to hell with the economy or our ability to supply europe with gas and oil of the roughly 22 liquid natural gas lng export facilities being built only one has a full permit after years of waiting three more have provisional permits that may or may not ever receive a final permit almost all of the 22 could have received full permits by now like the xl pipeline obama is slowing the process to glacial speeds �to the significant detriment of all americans britains secret bid to fix un climate report impact on economy is ramped up daily mail march 30 2014 the economic impact of global warming was ramped up in the final draft by the un�s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc shortly before authors wrote the final version a british government official passed scientists a note complaining about an earlier more moderate draft tory mp peter bone said �it is always the same with climate change if the facts don�t suit them they change it to suit them but one of its contributors has accused the ipcc of being too �alarmist� � and demanded his name be withdrawn note this is part ii of the ipccs fifth assessment the first issued in late 2013 every ipcc assessment has been politicized to show alarmist predictions this one is no different every prediction it makes on extreme weather ocean temps rises are exactly the opposite of what is claimed in the summary for policy makers it never ceases to amaze us how the media lets them get away with baldfaced lies benefits of carbon use far outweigh its costs investors daily march 19 2014 the environmental protection agency and other government agencies say fossil fuel and carbon dioxide emissions cause dangerous global warming�the agencies assume earths climate is highly sensitive to co2 then hypothesize almost every carbon cost including the impact on agriculture forestry water resources coastal cities ecosystems wildlife and human health had they followed federal laws and basic benefitcost analysis rules they would have found that hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide benefits outweigh the cost by at as much as 500to1 by addressing only the supposed impact and monetary cost of carbonbased fuel � while ignoring its most significant welldocumented benefits � government analyses and regulatory proposals violate the law note this shouldn�t be a surprise to anyone federal costbenefit analyses have always forged even a 5001 benefitcost ratio is not surprising the epa should be taken to court on april 24th 2014 china may unveil a secret new financial weapon built to bankrupt millions of americans stansberry research march 11 2014 this has nothing to do with global warming but readers must be warned for over a decade china has been secretly cornering the market on gold they mine their own gold and are buying massive amounts of gold on the world market much of it secretly to back their yuan to challenge the us dollar as the worlds reserve currency this unique weapon will disrupt nearly every aspect of normal american life with potentially devastating results learn what you absolutely must do now to prepare and protect your family note we have been warning of this for years and wrote extensively on it in our global financial death spiral series last fall it may not happen in april but china is committed to doing this very soon and you are not being warned if you havent read this series of articles it is imperative that you do swimming in a sea of disinformation over the great barrier reef herald sun march 10 2014 my god but journalists are suckers for warming scares the unquestioning sydney morning herald reported thelatest scare �the great barrier reef will be irreversibly damaged by climate change in just 16 years according to leading reef researcher ove hoeghguldberg but none of last week�s reports bothered to add that he also has a lousy track record in scaremongering note since the 1990s ove hoeghguldberg has cried the eminent demise of the great barrier reef only to say a few years later how relieved he was that the reef rebounded with flying colors his issued other false scaremonger stories as well but the press faithfully regurgitate each proclamation as coming from on high with no doubt of his credibility see the journalists trailing behind their messiah questioning nothing repeating everything oversensitive how the ipcc hid the good news on global warming global warming policy foundation march 1 2014 for the last two generations of climate models the value for longterm warming has averaged 32 ◦ c per doubling of co2 in the fourth assessment report 2007 of the ipcc the empirical estimates of climate sensitivity were largely based on poor data and used an inappropriate statistical basis biasing them towards higher values of climate sensitivity and thus making the global warming problem appear �worse� in the recent fifth assessment report fall 2013 many studies still use inappropriate data andor statistical methodology good empirical estimates of both longterm warming and that over a seventy year period now imply very different expectations of future warming than do climate models � some 40 to 50 lower to 2081�2100 note weve been saying this for years but this is the first hard evidence backing up our assertion what ukraine needs is an americanstyle shale gas revolution forbes march 3 2014 ukraine serves as a transit point for about 6 billion cubic feet per day of russia�s natgas exports into europe that�s about 22 trillion cubic feet per year or 14 of europe�s supply ukraine could hold more than 40 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas enough to satisfy decades of demand it is located in the far west northeast next to russia and crimea russia now controls the two eastern fields now with yanukovich gone it�s as if putin has taken the crimea as a kind of hostage � collateral to hold against what ukraine owes russia for gas a few billion dollars in ious is of course a less than flimsy pretext for thuggery which is why the kremlin�s propaganda machine has been spreading lies about how his soldiers are there to save ukraine�s ethnic russians from rightwing crazies note there is one more reason russia is paranoid of europe and the ukraine has served as a buffer for centuries russia has never allowed ukraine to develop its abundant natural resources and stalin brutally starved up to 6 million ukrainians in 193233 to weaken them industry bosses demand eu action on soaring energy prices eu observer february 28 2014 eu leaders must address rising energy prices and climate policies which are crippling the blocs manufacturing sector according to a manifesto signed by more than 100 industry bosses the eus manufacturing sector has been in steady decline for the past 20 years and now accounts for just 15 percent of economic output meanwhile 4 million manufacturing jobs across europe have been lost since 2008 note as reported for the past six months the eu is in full retreat of its green energy policies abandoning co2 emission reduction targets and backing out of expensive subsidies it is likely the green energy fiasco will be dead in two years green energy is probably responsible for half the 4 million lost manufacturing jobs across europe more practical conservatives warned them this would happen when the socialists started the green energy policies 12 years ago the eu green catastrophe doesnt faze obama however like a true progressive he knows how to do it right never mind the eu socialists did too 95 of climate models agree actual observed temperatures must be wrong wuwt february 10 2010 i�m seeing a lot of wrangling over the recent 15 year pause in global average warming�when did it start is it a full pause shouldn�t we be taking the longer view etc these are all interesting exercises but they miss the most important point the climate models that governments base policy decisions on have failed miserably that should have major policy implications�assuming policy is still informed by facts more than emotions and political aspirations note unfortunately policy doesnt have anything to do with facts and everything to do with political agendas the only proof warming alarmists have that man is causing warming are these models which have as their core driver a strong positive correlation with increasing co2 then they use the models to prove co2 causes warming circular reasoning except nature is not complying with the models explanation of graph hadcrut4 is the surface data produced by the cru and used by the ipcc uah is the far more accurate satellite measured temperatures europe stats to run not walk away from green economics investors business daily february 5 2014 in recent weeks europe has decided to run not walk as fast as it can away from the economic menace of green energy in brussels last month european leaders agreed to scrap pernation caps on carbon emissions the eu countries � france germany italy and spain � had promised a 40 reduction in emissions by 2030 and 80 by 2050 the new german economic minister sigmar gabriel says green energy mandates have become such an albatross around the neck of industry that they could lead to a deindustrialization of germany now those caps wont apply to individual nations green dreams have collided with cold economic reality green programs arent creating green jobs but green unemployment at intolerable doubledigit rates the quip in economically exhausted europe these days is that before we save the planet we have to save ourselves note see our penetrating article the disconnect on this written last fall us decjan temperatures 3rd coldest in 30 years the winter months of december 2013 and january 2014 averaged over the contiguous 48 united states were the 3rd coldest decjan in the last 30 years� an interesting feature is that 5 of the last 7 years have been below the 41year average which has happened only one other time in the 41year period note does this confirm earth is sliding into another cooling cycle no however this plus a lot of other evidence is building a solid case that a cooling cycle even another little ice age is underway but we have a ways to go before that is confirmed antarctic sea ice sets new record for jan 31 not a lot of people know that february 2 2014 antarctic sea ice extent continues to break records extent at 31st january of 4540 million sq km beat the previous record set in 2008 this is 26 higher than the climatological average for this date of 3598 million sq km on average antarctic sea ice reaches minimum on 20th february about a month earlier relatively speaking it is likely then that we will see a new record high minimum set this month note global warming enthusiasts are getting thumped every time they turn around for the past 14 months seems like nature is not following their meme on anything they claim is the absolute truth obamas sotu speech big on natural gas wall street journal january 29 2014 after upbeat comments about america�s energy boom president barack obama gave a big shout out to natural gas tuesday citing its impact on lowering carbon emission pollution and on businesses willingness to invest 100 million �i�ll cut red tape to help states get those factories built� mr obama said just 10 days ago 18 environmental groupsslammed the white house�s current energy strategy �all of the above� that draws on fossil fuelsoil natural gas and coal as well as clean energy note has obama had an epiphany and is no longer antifossil fuel we could dream its true but its not he also reaffirmed the mantra that climate change ie mancaused global warming is a fact he is doing what we forecast he would do throw the eco nuts under the bus

filed for insolvency on wednesday leaving tens of thousands of investors worried about their money the company advertised itself as a safe bet offering eight percent returns prokon which builds and manages wind parks has been a leading player in germanys ambitious plan to switch to renewable energy it managed to attract 75000 investors through a successful advertising campaign note another green manufacturer fails even with exorbitant subsidies if germany cuts back on these subsidies probably when not if how are these companies going to survive they cant never could socialist progressive insanity rides again how did angela merkel get reelected as chancellor oh i forgot how did obama ever get reelected delusion germanys industrial base at risk if green energy shift fails reuters january 21 2014 germany risks undermining its industrial base if it fails to undertake radical reform of incentives for the countrys renewable energy sector its new economy minister said on tuesday in a clear signal of his support for industry exportoriented german companies have warned that a surge in power costs caused largely by the green power incentives will make them internationally uncompetitive and some have even threatened to move out according to a draft proposal seen by reuters at the weekend economy minister gabriel will recommend to the cabinet that germany cuts the support price paid for electricity from solar and wind power generators by about a third by 2015 note this was forecast ten years ago there is no way green energy can be economically viable with current technology the entire eu green energy program is in total collapse yet obama blindly destroys our coal industry and pushes the same failed policies full steam ahead he is either insane or is deliberately destroying america or both is a mini ice age on the way scientists warn sun gone to sleep the daily mail january 17 2014 the suns activity is at its lowest for 100 years scientists have warned they say the conditions are eerily similar to those before the maunder minimum a time in 1645 when a mini ice age hit freezing londons river thames we have 400 years of observations and it is in a very similar to phase as it was in the runup to the maunder minimum the world we live in today is very different human activity may counteract this it is difficult to say what the consequences are note this subject is now being hotly discussed in the scientific community and as we have reported many times before by a rapidly growing number of scientists this article lists comments from several scientists what caught my attention is the claim by one that human activity may counteract this forecast cooling maybe however that assumes co2 has played a role in warming evidence is now solidly against that its most likely the sun europe to ditch climate protection goals spiegel online international january 15 2014 � the european commission wants to forgo ambitious climate protection goals and pave the way for fracking jeopardizing germanys touted energy revolution in the process as of 2020 at the latest when the current commitment to further increase the share of green energy expires climate protection in the eu will apparently be pursued on a voluntary basis in addition the authority wants to pave the way in the eu for the controversial practice of fracking the report says the commission does not intend to establish strict rules for the extraction of shale gas but only minimum health and environmental standards� note weve been reporting the slow progress of the eu to this goal resulting from the near cataclysmic disaster green energy has been in europe see my article the disconnect now the floodgates are open environmentalists and socialists are about to suffer

feb 2nd according to their models weatherbell has had an excellent track record this winter so far he says he hasn�t seen anything like it since 1918 when the big flu pandemic hit the usa note this is serious the polar vortex in late december and early january was significant if this forecast is correct it will beat the cooling from 194579 and get into the frigid climate of the early 20 th century however one year a trend does not make even so with the record winters in europe and asia the past two years it bears watching a rapidly increasing number of solar scientists physicists geologists and even climatologists are now warning we are entering a 4070 solar hibernation which could produce record low temperatures and disastrous crop failures of the little ice age in the 1700s and 1800s the

            "text": "No 'Free Rein' for the EPA. The Hill, July 2, 2014. Important! An Constitutional attorney part of the recent Supreme Court decision on the EPA explains the decision goes much further than previously thought. The decision \"clearly rain's] in the agency from what has become a pattern of regulatory overreach. This will prove to be a heavy blow to the EPA�s future plans to regulate carbon...  More than 6 million buildings and facilities potentially would now need permits\" under EPA's new regs. \"This included schools, churches, apartment buildings and everything in between, which even the EPA recognized would be absurd... The EPA had another solution:  'Tailor' the statute � or essentially rewrite it � to increase permitting levels to target major facilities like power plants, while reserving authority to tighten thresholds over time so that an increasing number of buildings and facilities ultimately would be required to obtain permits... The Court told the EPA that basic Separation of Powers principles do not permit Executive Branch agencies to rewrite duly enacted laws.  The Court therefore struck down the Tailoring Rule, holding that 'it would be patently unreasonable � not to say outrageous � for the EPA to insist on seizing expansive power' to rewrite Congressional enactments.\" NOTE: I have warned of EPA's rewrite in Range magazine for 2 years. Although early reports of the Court's ruling seemed to suggest limited curtailment of the EPA's rules on carbon, it now appears the Court really clipped the wings of EPA's continuous attempts to become the High Priest of the U.S. If so, it is a real win for every American. Failure of Climate Models . Leading international scientists explain why man-caused global warming cannot be occurring. The entire man-caused global warming fear is based on climate (computer) models. Climate models cannot duplicate the complexity of earth's climate.

quote of the week if you wish to converse with me define your terms — voltaire ht gordon cheyne in master resource number of the week 679 – 23 no consensus nature magazine published an article by jeff tollefson on the failure of the earths surface to warm for the past 16 years that contained an interesting sentence that has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared could this be a first indication that nature recognizes that there are qualified scientists who are skeptical of the work of the un intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc and the claim that human emissions of carbon dioxide co2 and other greenhouse gases are causing unprecedented and dangerous global warming if so is this an admission that there is no consensus as frequently claimed one must be careful not to read too much into this sentence least that person be grouped with those military analysts who spent their cold war military careers looking for changes in soviet policy by carefully dissecting sentences in the communist newspaper pravda to a limited extent the article discusses some possible causes for the failure of the earths surface to warm including changes in the trade winds over the tropical pacific which change cloudiness when there are more clouds the suns energy is reflected back into space when there are less clouds more energy reaches the oceans resulting in warming roy spencer has long discussed that slight changes in cloudiness will have dramatic effects other suggestions include changes in the sun volcanoes emitting aerosols fine particles and liquid droplets that have a cooling effect no major volcanoes noted and china emitting aerosols pollution although the article offers no rigorous explanation of the possible causes at least it brings up the issue that nature has failed to obey humancreated climate models though not discussed the article creates a question about the ipcc summary for policymakers with its claim in 2007 fourth assessment report – ar4 of 90 certainty and in 2013 fifth assessment report – ar5 of 95 certainty that humans are the cause of global warmingclimate change the question is what is meant by this certainty there are many issues of natural variation that are not discussed in the reports the article contained comments by members of the climate establishment who gave excuses why the models fail to perform not rigorous explanations of what must be done to the models to give them predictive value if you are interested in global climate change your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years says susan solomon a climate scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge solomon was a drafting author of ar4 which expressed 90 certainty in its work the key period of the 2007 assertion certainty was late 20 th century surface warming

longtime writer for science what happened to global warming scientists say just wait a bit which was published in the october 1 2009 edition of the magazine the article contained the statement in the hadcrut3 temperature record the world warmed by 007°c±007°c from 1999 through 2008 not the 020°c expected by the intergovernmental panel on climate change corrected for the natural temperature effects of el niño and its sister climate event la niña the decades trend is a perfectly flat 000°c the epa finding that greenhouse gas emissions principally co2 are causing unprecedented and dangerous global warming endangering human health and welfare was made two months later on december 7 2009 too late for the courts the recognition that prior to the endangerment finding the temperature record had no trend for a decade is an increasing piece of history and illustrates the lack of thoroughness of epa science see link under questioning the orthodoxy hearings the senate environmental and public works

new york times michael hockeystick mann labeled judith currys testimony as antiscience curry has taken the challenge jc challenge to mm since you have publicly accused my congressional testimony of being antiscience i expect you to publicly document and rebut any statement in my testimony that is factually inaccurate or where my conclusions are not supported by the evidence that i provide during the hearing senator whitehouse asked me a question about why people refer to me as a contrarian i said something like the following skepticism is one of the norms of science we build confidence in our theories as they are able to withstand skeptical challenges if instead scientists defend their theories by calling their opponents names well that is a sign that their theories are in trouble antiscience is a murky word with a number of connotations an excerpt from the wikipedia article on antiscience the question often lies in how much scientists conform to the standard ideal of communalism universalism disinterestedness originality and skepticism unfortunately scientists dont always conform scientists do get passionate about pet theories they do rely on reputation in judging a scientists work they do pursue fame and gain via research thus they may show inherent biases in their work from the rational wiki article on antiscience antiscience proponents often attack science through attempts to discredit the scientists themselves attempts to use flawed arguments such as argumentum ad populum to prove the position correct even if it has no scientific basis attempts to label scientific ideas as conspiracy theories jc message to mm if you want to avoid yourself being labeled as antiscience i suggest that you are obligated to respond to my challenge a conspiracy buff

been written about natural gas replacing coal as the fuel of choice for producing electricity in the us economics professor mark perry brings up an excellent point regarding this shift during severe cold weather the price of natural gas spikes causing the costs of generating electricity to spike perry gives some illustrations he argues for using nuclear power plants for base load because they are not subject to price spikes base load is the electricity generation 24 hours a day 7 days a week except for scheduled maintenance the same could be said for using modern coalfired power plants which the epa will oppose see link under nuclear energy and fears wind power the web site master resource has a 4 part series based on a letter glen schleede sent to the senate finance committee exposing the economically destructive and foolish tax subsidies being considered by the committee on behalf of socalled clean energy – producing electricity without generating carbon dioxide the summary and part two on the high cost and low value of wind power were posted with the other two parts coming next week the main points brought up thus far are • electricity from wind is high in true cost and low in true value • massive wealth transfers harming ordinary taxpayers and electric customers • misdirecting billions in capital investments dollars • high electricity prices that are particularly hard on low income people • adverse environmental ecological scenic and property values impacts see link under alternative green clean solar and wind energy policy former oil man and wind energy advocate t boone pickens points out that it has been over 40 years since president nixon called for a national energy policy washington has had energy policies but not one singularly identified among the many policies are denial advocacy and benign neglect these policies can be rated according to two standards that which promotes washington control and that which promotes general prosperity of the nation the two standards suggested here are not absolute but they give a starting point for evaluation the oil industry along the northern slope of alaska is an example of denial after the great success of the initial development of oil and the alaska pipeline washington started to deny further exploration and development the deliberate reduction in oil development is reaching the point at which it is questionable if the pipeline can be kept open in the future it is having a negative effect on the budget of the state which receives royalties each time proposals are made in congress to open the north slope to further development the proponents are shouted down that it would take ten years washingtons game have been going on for over a decade it is an excellent illustration of washington power and indifference to general prosperity the heavy subsidies to wind and solar power are examples of advocacy the central problem of storage of electricity on an inexpensive commercial scale has not been solved after two decades of subsidies wind and solar can not stand on their own green jobs did not materialize in quantities promised and they are not sustainable without subsidies or mandates wind and solar are examples of washingtons power and indifference to general prosperity perhaps what is needed is the requirement that all federal buildings and official washington rely only on wind and solar with no backup eventually all but the most obtuse politicians and bureaucrats would grasp the problem the development of techniques for extracting oil natural gas and natural gas liquids from dense shale is an example benign neglect some in washington claim credit but the success is on private and stateowned lands outside of control from washington there is no need for subsidies or mandates the contribution to general prosperity is becoming more evident monthly unemployment rates in areas with the greatest activity are far below the national or regional rates in his article pickens bring up the natural gas revolution that switched him from being a wind power promoter see links under energy issues – us number of the week 679 – 23 according to senator tom coburn r

            "text": "###################################################\n\nQuote of the Week: If you wish to converse with me, define your terms. — Voltaire, H/t Gordon Cheyne, in Master Resource\n\nNumber of the Week: 679 – 23\n\nNo Consensus? Nature magazine published an article by Jeff Tollefson on the failure of the earth’s surface to warm for the past 16 years that contained an interesting sentence: That has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases, and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared. Could this be a first indication that Nature recognizes that there are qualified scientists who are skeptical of the work of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the claim that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases are causing unprecedented and dangerous global warming? If so, is this an admission that there is no consensus as frequently claimed? One must be careful not to read too much into this sentence least that person be grouped with those military analysts who spent their cold war military careers looking for changes in Soviet policy by carefully dissecting sentences in the communist newspaper, Pravda.\n\nTo a limited extent, the article discusses some possible causes for the failure of the earth’s surface to warm including changes in the trade winds over the tropical Pacific, which change cloudiness. When there are more clouds, the sun’s energy is reflected back into space. When there are less clouds, more energy reaches the oceans, resulting in warming. Roy Spencer has long discussed that slight changes in cloudiness will have dramatic effects.\n\nOther suggestions include changes in the sun, volcanoes emitting aerosols (fine particles and liquid droplets) that have a cooling effect (no major volcanoes noted), and China emitting aerosols (pollution).\n\nAlthough the article offers no rigorous explanation of the possible causes, at least it brings up the issue that nature has failed to obey human-created climate models. Though not discussed, the article creates a question about the IPCC Summary for Policymakers with its claim in 2007 (Fourth Assessment Report – AR4) of 90% certainty and in 2013 (Fifth Assessment Report – AR5) of 95% certainty that humans are the cause of global warming/climate change. The question is: What is meant by this certainty? There are many issues of natural variation that are not discussed in the reports.\n\nThe article contained comments by members of the climate establishment who gave excuses why the models fail to perform, not rigorous explanations of what must be done to the models to give them predictive value. “If you are interested in global climate change, your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years,” says Susan Solomon, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Solomon was a drafting author of AR4 which expressed 90% certainty in its work.\n\nThe key period of the 2007 assertion certainty was late 20th century surface warming of a little more than 20 years – about 1976 to 1998. Now Solomon says periods of 50 to 100 years are needed. Does this mean that the certainty expressed in the IPCC AR4 and AR5 Summary for Policymakers are hasty conclusions? See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Problems in the Orthodoxy.\n\n******************\n\nWarming Trend or Jolt? Writing in Master Resource, Robert Bradley Jr. discusses an article by Richard Kerr, a long-time writer for Science, “What Happened to Global Warming? Scientists Say Just Wait a Bit,” which was published in the October 1, 2009 edition of the magazine. The article contained the statement: In the HadCRUT3 temperature record, the world warmed by 0.07°C±0.07°C from 1999 through 2008, not the 0.20°C expected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Corrected for the natural temperature effects of El Niño and its sister climate event La Niña, the decade’s trend is a perfectly flat 0.00°C.\n\nThe EPA finding that greenhouse gas emissions, principally CO2, are causing unprecedented and dangerous global warming endangering human health and welfare was made two months later, on December 7, 2009. Too late for the courts, the recognition that prior to the endangerment finding the temperature record had no trend for a decade is an increasing piece of history and illustrates the lack of thoroughness of EPA science. See link under Questioning the Orthodoxy.\n\n******************\n\nHearings: The Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee held a hearing on the President’s Climate Action Plan. Most of the time was spent on typical posturing by politicians and bureaucrats. The testimony by Judith Curry and global warming advocate Andrew Dessler may be of particular interest. See link under Seeking a Common Ground.\n\n******************\n\nThe Anti-Science Challenge: One incident coming from the Senate testimony is an anti-science challenge. Writing in the New York Times, Michael “Hockey-Stick” Mann labeled Judith Curry’s testimony as anti-science. Curry has taken the challenge: JC challenge to MM: Since you have publicly accused my Congressional testimony of being ‘anti-science,’ I expect you to (publicly) document and rebut any statement in my testimony that is factually inaccurate or where my conclusions are not supported by the evidence that I provide.\n\nDuring the Hearing, Senator Whitehouse asked me a question about why people refer to me as a ‘contrarian.’ I said something like the following: Skepticism is one of the norms of science. We build confidence in our theories as they are able to withstand skeptical challenges. If instead scientists defend their theories by calling their opponents names, well that is a sign that their theories are in trouble.\n\nAnti-science is a murky word, with a number of connotations. An excerpt from the wikipedia article on Antiscience:\n\nThe question often lies in how much scientists conform to the standard ideal of “communalism, universalism, disinterestedness, originality, and… skepticism”. Unfortunately, “scientists don’t always conform… scientists do get passionate about pet theories; they do rely on reputation in judging a scientist’s work; they do pursue fame and gain via research”. Thus, they may show inherent biases in their work.\n\nFrom the Rational Wiki article on Antiscience:\n\nAnti-science proponents often attack science through: Attempts to discredit the scientists themselves. Attempts to use flawed arguments, such as argumentum ad populum to prove the position correct even if it has no scientific basis. Attempts to label scientific ideas as conspiracy theories.\n\nJC message to MM: If you want to avoid yourself being labeled as ‘anti-science’, I suggest that you are obligated to respond to my challenge.\n\nA conspiracy buff may wonder if the New York Times, and other outlets, provide a forum for Mr. Mann in order to discredit science in general, and climate science in particular. If so, he is doing a good job. See link under Oh Mann!\n\n******************\n\nClimate Vortex: The claim that global warming is causing more extreme cold events continues to reverberate. President Obama is scheduled to give his State of the Union address at 9 pm on Tuesday. Weather forecasts have Washington receiving another blast of cold air that day, with nighttime temperatures falling to about 11ºF (-12 ºC). [This is about 17ºF (10ºC, allow for rounding) below the mid-January normal low is about 28ºF (-2 ºC).] Will the President follow his chief science advisor and blame the cold on global warming? See links under Climate Vortex – Whirlpool, Cyclone, or Quagmire?\n\n******************\n\nBase Load: Much has been written about natural gas replacing coal as the fuel of choice for producing electricity in the US. Economics professor Mark Perry brings up an excellent point regarding this shift. During severe cold weather, the price of natural gas spikes, causing the costs of generating electricity to spike. Perry gives some illustrations. He argues for using nuclear power plants for base load, because they are not subject to price spikes. [Base load is the electricity generation 24 hours a day 7 days a week, except for scheduled maintenance.] The same could be said for using modern coal-fired power plants, which the EPA will oppose. See link under Nuclear Energy and Fears\n\n******************\n\nWind Power: The web site, Master Resource has a 4 part series based on a letter Glen Schleede sent to the Senate Finance Committee exposing the economically destructive and foolish tax subsidies being considered by the Committee on behalf of so-called “clean energy” – producing electricity without generating carbon dioxide. The summary and part two on the high cost and low value of wind power were posted with the other two parts coming next week.\n\nThe main points brought up thus far are:\n\n• Electricity from wind is high in true cost and low in true value.\n\n• Massive wealth transfers harming ordinary taxpayers and electric customers.\n\n• Misdirecting billions in capital investments dollars.\n\n• High electricity prices that are particularly hard on low income people.\n\n• Adverse environmental, ecological, scenic, and property values impacts.\n\nSee link under Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Solar and Wind\n\n******************\n\nEnergy Policy: Former oil man and wind energy advocate, T. Boone Pickens points out that it has been over 40 years since President Nixon called for a national energy policy. Washington has had energy policies but not one singularly identified. Among the many policies are denial, advocacy, and benign neglect. These policies can be rated according to two standards: that which promotes Washington control and that which promotes general prosperity of the nation. The two standards suggested here are not absolute, but they give a starting point for evaluation.\n\nThe oil industry along the northern slope of Alaska is an example of denial. After the great success of the initial development of oil and the Alaska pipeline, Washington started to deny further exploration and development. The deliberate reduction in oil development is reaching the point at which it is questionable if the pipeline can be kept open in the future. It is having a negative effect on the budget of the state, which receives royalties. Each time proposals are made in Congress to open the North Slope to further development, the proponents are shouted down that it would take ten years. Washington’s game have been going on for over a decade. It is an excellent illustration of Washington power and indifference to general prosperity.\n\nThe heavy subsidies to wind and solar power are examples of advocacy. The central problem of storage of electricity on an inexpensive, commercial scale has not been solved. After two decades of subsidies, wind and solar cannot stand on their own. Green jobs did not materialize in quantities promised, and they are not sustainable without subsidies or mandates. Wind and solar are examples of Washington’s power and indifference to general prosperity. Perhaps what is needed is the requirement that all Federal buildings and official Washington rely only on wind and solar, with no back-up. Eventually, all but the most obtuse politicians and bureaucrats would grasp the problem.\n\nThe development of techniques for extracting oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids from dense shale is an example benign neglect. Some in Washington claim credit, but the success is on private and state-owned lands, outside of control from Washington. There is no need for subsidies or mandates. The contribution to general prosperity is becoming more evident monthly, unemployment rates in areas with the greatest activity are far below the national or regional rates. In his article, Pickens bring up the natural gas revolution that switched him from being a wind power promoter. See links under Energy Issues – US.\n\n******************\n\nNumber of the Week: 679 – 23. According to Senator Tom Coburn (R., Okla.), the Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the US government has 679 renewable energy programs from 23 different agencies costing $15 billion a year. Who says the Federal government does not have an energy policy? It has at least 679. See link under Green Jobs.\n\n###################################################\n\n1.

these cycles last roughly 11 years and the current one reached its peak last year what bothers scientists is that it wasnt much of a peak in fact it was the most feeble for more than a century this

Now it’s become one of the hottest topics among climate scientists: why has global warming stopped?\n\nSince the late 1980s, we’ve been told that our planet is warming up with potentially disastrous consequences. Leading climate scientists have declared – with increasing confidence – that the fault lies with mankind, with our reckless use of greenhouse gas-generating fossil fuels.\n\nYet not everyone has gone along with this scientific consensus.

posted about an article in nature which in part draws on a paper by kevin trenberth and john fasullo published late last year thing is anthony has already posted a number of articles about trenberth and fasullo 2013 there is this one by bob tisdale which i wrote about here and this one and this one both also by bob tisdale perennially puzzled bob tisdale was trying to argue that trenberth and fasullo were cheating or something silly like that since i wrote the main article anthony has elevated his piece to a sticky which just shows what hotwhopper readers know from past experience anthonys memory is not that great in this latest wuwt article archived here anthony wrote this as if it was the first article about the trenberth fasullo paper at wuwt instead of the fourth in a just a little over a month from the settled science department it seems even dr kevin trenberth is now admitting to the cyclic influences of the amo and pdo on global climate neither carbon nor carbon dioxide is mentioned in this article that cites trenberth as saying the 1997 to 98 el niño event was a trigger for the changes in the pacific and i think thats very probably the beginning of the hiatus this is significant as it represents a coming to terms with the pause not only by nature but by trenberth too for anyone who knows of kevin trenberths work to say that first second sentence of anthonys is ludicrous would be an understatement kevin trenberth has been publishing papers about the oceans for more than forty years he knows more about oceans than all the purported hundreds of thousands of wuwt readers combined john fasullo is younger but if you combine them they have more than 55 person years of science between them if anthony watts is interested in tracking the history of discovery of the pacific decadal oscillation he could do a lot worse than starting with the following two seminal papers by kevin trenberth going back nearly 25 years trenberth kevin e recent observed interdecadal climate changes in the northern hemisphere bulletin of the american meteorological society 71 no 7 1990 988993 trenberth kevin e and james w hurrell decadal atmosphereocean variations in the pacific climate dynamics 9 no 6 1994 303319 since were tracking back history this 1981 paper might be of interest though its probably peripheral to the subject it was cited in mantua hare et al 1997 trenberth kevin e and daniel a paolino jr characteristic patterns of variability of sea level pressure in the northern hemisphere monthly weather review 109 no 6 1981 11691189 what caught my eye was the opening sentence particularly given anthonys opening comments about dr trenberth finally admitting to cyclic influences the atmospheric circulation is characterized by various centers of action which are spatially interdependent since ive plugged the references here ill add the pdo paper mantua nathan j steven r hare yuan zhang john m wallace and robert c francis a pacific interdecadal climate oscillation with impacts on salmon production bulletin of the american meteorological society 78 no 6 1997 10691079 back to the nature article here are some key excerpts discussing the hiatus in surface temperature rise in recent years trenberth estimated that aerosols and solar activity account for just 20 of the hiatus that leaves the bulk of the hiatus to the oceans which serve as giant sponges for heat and here the spotlight falls on the equatorial pacific just before the hiatus took hold that region had turned unusually warm during the el niño of 1997–98 which fuelled extreme weather across the planet from floods in chile and california to droughts and wildfires in mexico and indonesia but it ended just as quickly as it had begun and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of el niños sister effect la niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial pacific with a vengeance more importantly the entire eastern pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day this variation in ocean temperature known as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo may be a crucial piece of the hiatus puzzle the cycle reverses every 15–30 years and in its positive phase the oscillation favours el niño which tends to warm the atmosphere see the fickle ocean after a couple of decades of releasing heat from the eastern and central pacific the region cools and enters the negative phase of the pdo this state tends towards la niña which brings cool waters up from the depths along the equator and tends to cool the planet researchers identified the pdo pattern in 1997 but have only recently begun to understand how it fits in with broader oceancirculation patterns and how it may help to explain the hiatus one important finding came in 2011 when a team of researchers at ncar led by gerald meehl reported that inserting a pdo pattern into global climate models causes decadescale breaks in global warming3 oceantemperature data from the recent hiatus reveal why in a subsequent study the ncar researchers showed that more heat moved into the deep ocean after 1998 which helped to prevent the atmosphere from warming6 in a third paper the group used computer models to document the flip side of the process when the pdo switches to its positive phase it heats up the surface ocean and atmosphere helping to drive decades of rapid warming7 a key breakthrough came last year from shangping xie and yu kosaka at the scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla california the duo took a different tack by programming a model with actual sea surface temperatures from recent decades in the eastern equatorial pacific and then seeing what happened to the rest of the globe8 their model not only recreated the hiatus in global temperatures but also reproduced some of the seasonal and regional climate trends that have marked the hiatus including warming in many areas and cooler northern winters that was investigated by trenberth and john fasullo also at ncar who brought in winds and ocean data to explain how the pattern emerges4 their study documents how tropical trade winds associated with la niña conditions help to drive warm water westward and ultimately deep into the ocean while promoting the upwelling of cool waters along the eastern equatorial region in extreme cases such as the la niña of 1998 this may be able to push the ocean into a cool phase of the pdo an analysis of historical data buttressed these conclusions showing that the cool phase of the pdo coincided with a few decades of cooler temperatures after the second world war see the pacifics global reach and that the warm phase lined up with the sharp spike seen in global temperatures between 1976 and 1998 ref 4 the article goes on to discuss the work of mark cane who proposes that global warming may lead to extended la ninas other scientists work suggests that global warming may lead to more el ninos time and more research will tell now youll be wondering why anthony watts mentioned the atlantic multidecadal oscillation so am i it isnt mentioned in the nature article although it is mentioned in trenberth and fasullo 2013 maybe anthony actually read a scientific paper not likely from the wuwt comments there arent any stand out comments so ill award the comment of the day to anthony watts himself for his opening comments about kevin trenberth who was arguably very influential in shaping the understanding of what we know today as the pacific decadal oscillation most wuwt readers will be in for a big shock when the next el nino arrives dirkh doesnt have a clue about climate models and says january 16 2014 at 410 am the simplest explanation for both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the models is natural variability no thats nonsense the simplest explanation is that the theory is falsified and that the models are wrong in fact everything points at the models being wrong false and useless not one thing points to the models being right correct or useful there are simply no such reports we should see thousands of triumphant papers confirming again and again that the models got this right and that right after many years of painstaking development but we never see any such report thats like celebrating the 100000th lancaster bomber built and shipped over the atlantic while not one of them ever made it through the kammhuber line johnmarshall is a scientists dont no nuffin denier and says january 16 2014 at 412 am trenberth getting a reality hit one of his problems is a complete misunderstanding of latent heat which is where much heat has been used for in cooling at the surface and has stupid graphic in ar4 which uses a flat earth with 247 sunlight and no idea from where radiated energy comes from chris marlowe says january 16 2014 at 429 am the smartest of these guys will be looking for an exit strategy and will eventually look the other way if anyone suggests they were once on the bandwagon beating the drum stephen richards is a conspiracy nutter and says january 16 2014 at 436 am what i dont want is for these guys to remain in place when this whole scam is exposed like erlich they will just keep coming back with another scare for money scheme m courtney struggles to understand climate and energy accumulation and says january 16 2014 at 446 am not sure that this report does fully recognise the impact of natural cycles it seems to think that the cooling phase of the pdo exactly balances the warming from greenhouse gases over several decades when the emissions have varied that raises two questions 1 how come the balancing is so precise – are our emissions coupled to the pdo or is their effect swamped by the pdo 2 if the pdo can match the magnitude of agw on th ecool sided can it match the magnitude of agw on the warm side if so how do we know any of the 20thc warming was manmade ivor ward misunderstands whats written and thinks that kevin trenberth agrees with bob tisdale that there are leprechauns burning coal fires in the oceans and says january 16 2014 at 502 am so essentially he is saying that bob tisdale is right and he was wrong why does trenberth not just say that and get it over with jim cripwell is about right except when it comes to australias pm tony abbott when he says excerpt january 16 2014 at 512 am unfortunately what is written on wuwt carries little weight with our politicians and the msm graphicconception also mistakenly thinks that kevin trenberth attributes global warming to leprechauns like bob tisdale does and says january 16 2014 at 524 am the temperature graph is a kind of integration of the pdo index graph you need to add 06 to the index cumulate and then scale where do i collect my nobel prize so as bob tisdale has been saying if i understand it correctly pdo variations are not just oscillations about a mean they leave a resultant change evanmjones knows nothing about science either i bet he thinks a fake sceptic invented the pdo when he says january 16 2014 at 529 am yeah they finally discovered the pdo sort of like a professional secretary discovering the shift key bloody amateurs now they need to discover that their panic was due to a positive pdo and consequently their projections were at least twice too high then maybe they can learn the rest of the alphabet i cant say i agree with clivebest when he says january 16 2014 at 556 am the graphic above shows that we have only just entered a new 30 year long cool period of the pdo this means that there will be no further warming until 2030 warming may well then resume after 2030 but whichever way you look at it climate sensitivity looks to be about one half of current ipcc estimates how is the ipcc going to keep the egg off its face for the next 15 years conspiracy nutter timothy spawned an idiot in david ball who says january 16 2014 at 613 am now after having wasted at least 30 years of public money and time due to our false ideology we return you to your regularly scheduled viewing idiots resourceguy says january 16 2014 at 626 am at some point the deadenders will attack the wavering warmists and excommunicate them from the treasure hunt known as carbon tax revenue the only question is whether it will be a peaceful process or a north koreanstyle purge clay marley is mistaken if he thinks bob tisdale invented the sloshing enso unlike bob who thinks the oceans will keep warming forever clay is hopeful that earths temperatures will one day return to normal he says it has to end january 16 2014 at 638 am first id heard the term sloshing is in tisdales posts and book it isnt intended to be a scientifiky term that trentberth uses it probably means at least that he is reading tisdale which would be a good thing but he is hopingpraying for another strong el niño that would start the warming again tisdale is saying that a strong el niño will cause a rapid sst rise over much of the earth after the event ssts cool slowly if the el niño events come frequently enough there isnt enough time between them to cool completely thus we see a stairstep warming with slight cooling between events this is what has been happening since around 1918 it has to end though we cant keep getting strong el niños until the oceans boil so there must be some process that slows and weakens the el niños and allows the restofworld to get back to lower temps richard m says that dr trenberth dont know nuffin about oceans and could learn a thing or two from perennially puzzled bob this one is runnerup comment of the day after anthonys opening comment january 16 2014 at 715 am trenberth doesnt realize that el niño events might not quite work the same during a pdo as tisdale has demonstrated it is the after effects of the el niño during a pdo that have a lot to do with the step up warming that occurs even after the following la niña i have a feeling that the changes in circulation in a pdo will eliminate that effect didnt see it during the 20092010 el niño that is probably why the global temperature falls during a pdo i wonder how many copies of tisdales books will find their way to ncar or should i say have found their way these wuwters arent just scientifically illiterate they are deluded heres another one from economic geologist who says january 16 2014 at 742 am i think trenberth is reading tisdale but will never give him credit the agw crowd will slowly morph their scientific positions as their predictions continue to fail and noone will be held accountable for all the money wasted on useless misguided research and noone in the skeptic camp will be acknowledged for having seen the weaknesses in the climate communitys science theres no justice in this world oh thats more than enough i cant be bothered reading the rest you can

Some warming has occurred in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean in the recent fortnight, due to a weakening of the trade winds. If the trade winds remain weak, more warming towards El Niño thresholds is possible.The Bureau’s ENSO Tracker remains at WATCH status. This means the chance of an El Niño developing in 2014 is at least 50%, which is double the normal likelihood of an event. Five of the eight climate models surveyed by the Bureau suggest El Niño is likely for spring. However, if El Niño were to occur, it is unlikely to be a strong event.",

The NGSS are biased and riddled with propaganda designed to indoctrinate students and drive an eco-agenda.\n\nWhat does the NGSS teach? In its Core Ideas section, it states: “However, it is clear not only that human activities play a major role in climate change but also that impacts of climate change—for example, increased frequency of severe storms due to ocean warming—have begun to influence human activities.”\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its Fifth Assessment Report released March 31 significantly downplayed its storm-increase alarmism, albeit in a vague manner, when stated: “There is low confidence in region-specific projections of storminess and associated storm surges.”\n\nA decreased frequency of severe storms is the likely reason. Researchers at Florida State University concluded that the 2007 and 2008 hurricane seasons represented the lowest level of tropical activity in the Northern Hemisphere in 30 years. In fact, 2013 was the first Atlantic Hurricane season with no hurricanes since 1994.\n\nNGSS also state: “By the end of grade 8. Human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are major factors in the current rise in Earth’s mean surface temperature (global warming).”\n\nHowever, we have had no increase in global temperatures for the past 17 years. According to Nature Magazine, normally a global warming cheerleader, “average global temperatures hit a record high in 1998 — and then the warming stalled.”\n\nWyoming’s Legislature was right to reject NGSS indoctrination.

there is no doubt that the climate change cabal is worried it seems earths temperature is stubbornly refusing to rise according to the demands of their computer models do not misunderstand this is a big thing in climate circles it could bring into doubt the entire house of cards that is cagw even the economist a past cheerleader for the global warming crowd has been forced to admit that something is rotten in climate science see who pressed the pause button still attempts to explain away that stable average have not been convincing partly because of the conflict between flat temperatures and rising co 2 emissions and partly because observed temperatures are now falling outside the range climate models predict the models embody the state of climate knowledge if they are wrong the knowledge is probably faulty too hence attempts to explain the pause in short the whole bloody story could be a sham many climate change apologists have put forth explanations in fact the explanations have come from so many quarters that the economist has stated the slowdown in rising temperatures over the past 15 years goes from being unexplained to overexplained lets review the leading explanations in september 2013 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc pointed to fluctuating solar output atmospheric pollution and volcanoes all three conspired to suppress global warming gavin schmidt and two colleagues at nasas goddard institute quantify the effects of these trends in nature geoscience they argue that climate models underplay the delayed and subdued solar cycle and that volcanic

for these missing factors can bring the predictions back into line with reality as i have mentioned many times you can tune a computer model to give you any output you desire this is particularly easy after the fact as gavin and the giss boys know below are some of the corrections and outputs from their model the adjusted ensemble spread dashed grey clearly shows the decadal impact of the updated drivers the authors claim adding as an aside we note that although it is convenient to use the cmip5 ensemble to assess expected spreads in possible trends the ensemble is not a true probabilistic sample recently dr judith curry professor and chair of the school of earth and atmospheric sciences at the georgia institute of technology has been shedding light on why climate models are such failable friends to climate scientists as temperatures have declined and climate models have failed to predict this decline the ipcc has gained confidence in catastrophic warming and dismisses the pause as unpredictable climate variability she states on her blog moreover the ipcc does not have a convincing or confident explanation for the current hiatus in warming why the stagnation in greenhouse warming observed over the past 15 years demonstrates that co 2 is not a control knob on climate variability on decadal time scales said dr curry in testimony before the us senate the models overreliance on carbon dioxide as the primary driver of climate has bitten the hands of those who coded it into their models as a result the vast majority of their models failed to predict the pause as shown below pick a model any model and it will be wrong another proposed explanation says the missing heat is hiding in the deep ocean it is certainly true that earths oceans especially the largest the pacific absorb prodigious amount of heat energy storing some and transport it around the globe several new studies link the pause with changes in the pacific and the trade winds that influence the circulation of water within it there are a number of normal wholly natural cycles that center on the pacific the frequent el niño and la niña a longterm cycle called the pacific decadal oscillation pdo which switches from a warm to a cool every 20 or 30 years and a supposedly oneoff increase in the strength of the trade winds during the past 20 years this according to kevin trenberth and john fasullo of americas national center for atmospheric research ncar has produced a period of unexpected cooling the 1997 to 98 el niño event was a trigger for the changes in the pacific and i think thats very probably the beginning of the hiatus said trenberth in a news feature in nature according to this theory the tropical pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell sometime in the future eventually trenberth says it will switch back in the other direction trenberth is not alone in this hypothesis according to a paper in nature climate change by matthew england of the arc centre

            "text": "The Turning Of The Tide Submitted by Doug L. Hoffman on Tue, 03/25/2014 - 13:52 Supporters of the CO 2 driven theory of anthropogenic global warming (CAGW) are in full panic mode. The continued hiatus in global temperature increase has led to a flurry of statements denying “the pause,” as climate scientists have named it. This new denialism even extends to international organizations like the WHO, that just recently claimed that global warming had not ceased, even though numerous organizations—including Britain’s Meteorological Office, NASA, and the IPCC—have admitted that it has. Among climate change true believers there is a scramble on to “find the missing heat” that would explain the pause. Strangely, among these practitioners of group think there is no consensus about the cause of the pause. At the same time, the IPCC is about to release its latest screed regarding climate change and the leaks have been flowing fast and furious, saying there is dissent in the land of consensus. This may well be the turning of the tide on the greatest scientific hoax in history. The number varies between 15 and 17 years but there is no doubt that the climate change cabal is worried. It seems Earth's temperature is stubbornly refusing to rise according to the demands of their computer models. Do not misunderstand, this is a big thing in climate circles. It could bring into doubt the entire house of cards that is CAGW. Even the Economist, a past cheerleader for the global warming crowd, has been forced to admit that something is rotten in climate science (see “Who pressed the pause button?”): Still, attempts to explain away that stable average have not been convincing, partly because of the conflict between flat temperatures and rising CO 2 emissions, and partly because observed temperatures are now falling outside the range climate models predict. The models embody the state of climate knowledge. If they are wrong, the knowledge is probably faulty, too. Hence attempts to explain the pause. In short, the whole bloody story could be a sham. Many climate change apologists have put forth explanations. In fact, the explanations have come from so many quarters that the Economist has stated: “The slowdown in rising temperatures over the past 15 years goes from being unexplained to overexplained.” Let's review the leading explanations. In September 2013 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) pointed to fluctuating solar output, atmospheric pollution and volcanoes. All three conspired to suppress global warming. Gavin Schmidt and two colleagues at NASA’s Goddard Institute quantify the effects of these trends in Nature Geoscience. They argue that climate models underplay the delayed and subdued solar cycle, and that volcanic activity since 2000 has been greater than previously thought. Here is how Schmidt et al. framed the conundrum in “Reconciling warming trends”: Any divergence between real-world climate phenomena and prior expectations poses interesting science questions. The case of the apparent slow-down of warming since the record El Niño event in 1997/1998 is no exception. The global mean surface temperature trend was smaller1 between 1997 and 2013 (0.07±0.08 °C per decade) than over the last 50 years (0.16 ± 0.02 °C per decade), highlighting questions about the mechanisms that regulate decadal variability in the Earth's temperature. In addition, the warming trend in the most recent 15-year period is near the lower edge of the 5–95% range of projections from a collection of climate models that were part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Why most of the model simulations suggest more warming than has been observed is a second question that deserves further exploration. Tweaking their models for these missing factors can bring the predictions back into line with reality. As I have mentioned many times, you can tune a computer model to give you any output you desire. This is particularly easy after the fact, as Gavin and the GISS boys know. Below are some of the corrections and outputs from their model. “The adjusted ensemble spread (dashed grey) clearly shows the decadal impact of the updated drivers,” the authors claim, adding, “As an aside, we note that although it is convenient to use the CMIP5 ensemble to assess expected spreads in possible trends, the ensemble is not a true probabilistic sample.” Recently, Dr. Judith Curry, Professor and Chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has been shedding light on why climate models are such failable friends to climate scientists. “As temperatures have declined and climate models have failed to predict this decline, the IPCC has gained confidence in catastrophic warming and dismisses the pause as unpredictable climate variability,” she states on her blog. Moreover, “the IPCC does not have a convincing or confident explanation for the current hiatus in warming.” Why? “The stagnation in greenhouse warming observed over the past 15+ years demonstrates that CO 2 is not a control knob on climate variability on decadal time scales,” said Dr. Curry in testimony before the US Senate. The models' over-reliance on carbon dioxide as the primary driver of climate has bitten the hands of those who coded it into their models. As a result, the vast majority of their models failed to predict the pause as shown below. \n\n Pick a model, any model and it will be wrong. Another proposed explanation says the missing heat is hiding in the deep ocean. It is certainly true that Earth's oceans, especially the largest, the Pacific, absorb prodigious amount of heat energy, storing some and transport it around the globe. Several new studies link the pause with changes in the Pacific and the trade winds that influence the circulation of water within it. There are a number of normal, wholly natural cycles that center on the Pacific: the frequent El Niño and La Niña; a long-term cycle called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which switches from a warm to a cool every 20 or 30 years; and a supposedly one-off increase in the strength of the trade winds during the past 20 years. This, according to Kevin Trenberth and John Fasullo of America’s National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), has produced a period of unexpected cooling. “The 1997 to ’98 El Niño event was a trigger for the changes in the Pacific, and I think that’s very probably the beginning of the hiatus,” said Trenberth in a news feature in Nature. According to this theory, the tropical Pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell sometime in the future. “Eventually,” Trenberth says, “it will switch back in the other direction.” Trenberth is not alone in this hypothesis. According to a paper in Nature Climate Change, by Matthew England of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, University of New South Wales, the record trade winds have produced a super La Niña that is causing warm water to pile up at the western end of the Pacific. There it is getting buried by colder water, driving the heat deep into the ocean (see the figure below). This is known as the “the ocean ate my global warming” theory. “[T]he pause has gone from being not explained to explained twice over—once by aerosols and the solar cycle, and again by ocean winds and currents,” the Economist article concludes. “These two accounts are not contradictory. The processes at work are understood, but their relative contributions are not.” This doesn't mean that the UK new magazine or the supporters of CAGW are folding their tents. Indeed, the article concludes with a flippant “like the Terminator, global warming will be back.” The global warming carnival never ends. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will publish their first update in seven years on the scale of the threat. This will be the second of three reports on the causes, effects and solutions to climate change. Leaked documents speak of significant effects on economies, food supplies and security. But some participants in the IPCC process say the summary, due out on March 31, is far too alarmist. An interesting piece on the BBC website, by Environment correspondent Matt McGrath, hints at dissent among the experts assembled by the UN agency to do its bidding. IPCC scientists have distanced themselves from a number of their previous forecasts. Notable among these is the prediction of mass extinctions because of global warming. “There is very little confidence that the current models accurately predict the risk of extinction,” the new report states, contradicting previous IPCC tomes. In the draft report, no concrete numbers are mentioned for postulated extinction of species. “The message in the first draft was that through adaptation and clever development these were manageable risks, but it did require we get our act together,” Prof Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex, who has been the convening lead author of the chapter on economics, told BBC News. “This has completely disappeared from the draft now, which is all about the impacts of climate change and the four horsemen of the apocalypse.” The IPCC opting for scare tactics over rational evaluation? Imagine that. Even the notoriously pro-global warming Met Office says a lot more work must be done to confirm the links that do appear in the report. While the new report is shaping up to be more nuanced, with far more emphasis on adaptation than the last one in 2007, it comes at a time when climate change has fallen off the political radar. Writing in Foreign Policy magazine, Professor Roger Pielke Jr. has hit the nail on the head when it comes to climate change's falling public profile. Here is how his article, “Climate of Failure,” begins: The heady days of early 2009, when advocates for global action on climate change anticipated world leaders gathering later that year around a conference table in Copenhagen to reach a global agreement, are but a distant memory. Today, with many of these same leaders focusing their attention on jumpstarting economic growth, environmental issues have taken a back seat. For environmentalists, it may seem that climate policy has dropped from the political agenda altogether. They're right. The world's biggest emitters have reached a consensus of sorts, but not the one hoped for in Copenhagen. In the United States, President Barack Obama has borrowed his energy policy — “all of the above” — from the Republicans. Europe has dithered on any further commitments to emissions reductions as governments have been completely consumed by the euro crisis. China and India have used the follow-on conferences to Copenhagen, held in Durban and Cancun, to decisively push international climate negotiations into the long weeds. Leaders' attention to climate policy is not coming back — at least not in any form comparable to the plans being discussed just a few years ago. Pielke, who is a self described moderate in the climate change debate, goes on to say we should concentrate on attainable technologies to reduce our rampant CO 2 emissions, primarily Natural Gas. He correctly labels carbon capture from coal and gas, large-scale wind, and solar technologically immature and expensive, especially when compared to gas. Lastly he tells the climate change alarmists and greens to forget a “mythical high carbon price” in today's political climate. Professor Pielke is not alone in his call for more rational analysis of possible climate change impacts. Lenny Smith and Arthur Petersen have written a very interesting and insightful paper “Variations on Reliability: Connecting Climate Predictions to Climate Policy.” They question whether the statistical uncertainty adequately captures the relevant dominant uncertainty (RDU). “While the IPCC has led the climate science community in codifying uncertainty characterisation, it has paid much less attention to specifying the RDU,” they state. “The focus is at times more on ensuring reproducibility of computation than on relevance(fidelity) to the Earth’s climate system, in fact it is not always easy to distinguish which of these two are being discussed.” Barrack Obama is still offering lip service to green energy and climate change but he is rapidly becoming a political dinosaur.

and cooling cycles short term meaning decades in this case but the socalled skeptics have pointed to this for a very long time more about the paper can be found here the pacific decadal oscillation

heat and what progress is being made in explaining away the fact that none of the models predicting global warming by co2 forcing can account for the observed reality as a reminder here is the difference between the model predictions and what has actually happened the predictions of hansens climate model presented to the us congress in 1988 versus the reality source climatesensenorpag – click to enlarge however instead of simply admitting that the models may be wrong the heat is held to be hiding out in the oceans it is apparently widely hoped that it will return in time to save careers and grants from nature now as the globalwarming hiatus enters its sixteenth year scientists are at last making headway in the case of the missing heat some have pointed to the sun volcanoes and even pollution from china as potential culprits but recent studies suggest that the oceans are key to explaining the anomaly the latest suspect is the el niño of 1997–98 which pumped prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere — perhaps enough to tip the equatorial pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since the 1997 to 98 el niño event was a trigger for the changes in the pacific and i think thats very probably the beginning of the hiatus says kevin trenberth a climate scientist at the national center for atmospheric research ncar in boulder colorado according to this theory the tropical pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming years eventually trenberth says it will switch back in the other direction translation please dear lord let it switch back as soon as possible or the warming check is in the mail that is however perhaps less likely than thought see further below why if one looks at the chart of the pdo above a common sense question immediately springs to mind why was the warming trend prior to 1940 almost identical to that between 1976 and 1998 when obviously co2 emissions at the time can not have been a major factor this is not explained anywhere could it be that natural climate variability is actually the major factor in driving both warming and cooling phases and that co2 emissions by humans are in fact a negligible input interesting is also the following comment by another climate researcher cited in the nature article none of the climate simulations carried out for the ipcc produced this particular hiatus at this particular time that has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared others say that this conclusion goes against the longterm temperature trends as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past and many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively shortterm blip in the climate if you are interested in global climate change your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years says susan solomon a climate scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge emphasis added does that mean that if there is no warming for another century their vaunted models will still not be proved wrong if that is so then the science is guaranteed to only advance one funeral at a time as the saying goes by the way the differentiation between skeptics and scientists is an insult to the many skeptics who are in fact scientists and whose ranks are set to swell in our opinion temperature anomaly vs atmospheric co2 over the past 11000 years data gathered by examination of ice cores click to enlarge several skeptics are naturally pointing out that their work is suddenly integrated into the consensus with not a word being mentioned of the ridicule and opposition they had to endure for so long for instance here are dr sebastian lüning and prof fritz vahrenholt it took a while but ocean cycles have finally been adopted by the ipcc as an important climate factor with john fasullo kevin trenberth has written in a new paper appearing in the journal earths future that the warming pause taking place since 1998 indeed may have something to do with the pacific decadal oscillation pdo also even trenberths pal stefan rahmstorf suddenly thinks its a good possibility in 2012 when we brought up the pdo as one of the triggers for the 19761998 warming in our die kalte sonne book and proposed ocean cycles as a sort of pulse generator for temperature cycles on a decadal scale we were met with fierce resistance from the german climate science establishment now less than 2 years later die kalte sonne finds itself as mainstream science they also mention an interesting comment made by julia slingo of the met office at a royal society meeting last year she was playing devils advocate the devil being all those who say the climate models are crap ie the deniers and asked a well known alarmist a question he ultimately couldnt answer at a royal society meeting in 2013 julia slingo of the met office played devils advocate and posed the following question to prof jochen marotzke of the german max planck institute of meteorology see the 4246 mark royalsocietyorgmarotzkemp3 it s a great presentation about 15 years being irrelevant but i think some of us might say if you look at the pacific decadal oscillation and it s timescale that it appears to work it could be 30 years and therefore i think you know we are still not out of the woods yet on this one if you do think it s internal variability and you say we do think the pacific decadal oscillation is a key component of this and it s now in it s particular phase but was previously in the opposite phase could you not therefore explain the accelerated warming of the 80s and 90s as being driven by the other phase of natural variability simplifying slingos incoherence if the current cooling is due to the negative pdo phase then wouldn t the warming of the 80s and 90s be a result of the positive pdo phase back then marotzke answers after much incoherence of his own um i guess i m not sure these people make no sense at all they are sure its the oceans cold phase gobbling up heat when temperatures fail to rise but when temperatures increase they just cant be sure that the oceans are involved at all and insist they would not bet much money on it of course it just cant work only one way marotzke is delivering only what would call unadulterated absurd science emphasis added to ms slingos query what does were not out of the woods really mean that they are scared they have exaggerated and are as one commentator at anthony watts site remarked in need of an exit strategy the problem of modeling the future of a complex system the big problem is that the climate models that are at the root of the catastrophic anthropogenic global warming forecasts are trying to do something that is literally impossible below is a video of a presentation by christopher essex professor and associate chair in the department of applied mathematics at the university of western ontario and former director of its theoretical physics program now one thing we can expect professor essex to know a thing or two about are the mathematics behind the modeling and this is what the presentation focuses on it is done in a way that makes it possible even for a layperson to easily discern what the problems of these models are and that in fact these problems are insurmountable at least at present as an aside professor essex is of course both a skeptic and a scientist and he is far from alone for instance we would like to point readers to a 2009 paper he coauthored with eight other scholars and which has been reviewed by 50 others entitled critical topics in global warming the introduction tells us a little bit about the socalled consensus the issue of global warming is the subject of two parallel debates one scientific focused on the analyses of complex and conflicting data the other political addressing what is the proper response of government to a hypothetical risk proponents of an immediate and sweeping regulatory response insist that the scientific debate has long been settled but a fair reading of the science as presented in the fraser institutes independent summary for policymakers ispm proves otherwise the supplements to that report go deeper into some of the key topics and provide even more evidence that popularized notions about the causes and consequences of global warming are more fiction than fact when looking at the presentation below it becomes crystal clear why the science especially with regard to climate models simply can not be regarded as settled believing 6 impossible things before breakfast and climate modeling by christopher essex the quiet sun now a few remarks on why the missing heat may well go on missing for a good while yet below is an excerpt from a recent article published by the bcc regarding the activity of the sun which has declined to its lowest in at least a century scientists are baffled by this behavior – something highly unusual is evidently happening ive been a solar physicist for 30 years and ive never seen anything quite like this says richard harrison head of space physics at the rutherford appleton laboratory in oxfordshire he shows me recent footage captured by spacecraft that have their sights trained on our star the sun is revealed in exquisite detail but its face is strangely featureless if you want to go back to see when the sun was this inactive youve got to go back about 100 years he says this solar lull is baffling scientists because right now the sun should be awash with activity it has reached its solar maximum the point in its 11year cycle where activity is at a peak this giant ball of plasma should be peppered with sunspots exploding with flares and spewing out huge clouds of charged particles into space in the form of coronal mass ejections but apart from the odd event like some recent solar flares it has been very quiet and this damp squib of a maximum follows a solar minimum – the period when the suns activity troughs – that was longer and lower than scientists expected its completely taken me and many other solar scientists by surprise says dr lucie green from university college londons mullard space science laboratory the drop off in activity is happening surprisingly quickly and scientists are now watching closely to see if it will continue to plummet it could mean a very very inactive star it would feel like the sun is asleep a very dormant ball of gas at the centre of our solar system explains dr green this though would certainly not be the first time this has happened during the latter half of the 17th century the sun went through an extremely quiet phase – a period called the maunder minimum historical records reveal that sunspots virtually disappeared during this time dr green says there is a very strong hint that the sun is acting in the same way now as it did in the runup to the maunder minimum mike lockwood professor of space environment physics from the university of reading thinks there is a significant chance that the sun could become increasingly quiet an analysis of icecores which hold a longterm record of solar activity suggests the decline in activity is the fastest that has been seen in 10000 years its an unusually rapid decline explains prof lockwood we estimate that within about 40 years or so there is a 10 to 20 – nearer 20 – probability that well be back in maunder minimum conditions the era of solar inactivity in the 17th century coincided with a period of bitterly cold winters in europe londoners enjoyed frost fairs on the thames after it froze over snow cover across the continent increased the baltic sea iced over – the conditions were so harsh some describe it as a miniice age emphasis added the article naturally goes on to point out that according to the ipcc the effect of co2 emissions tops every other influence on the climate no wonder as co2 emissions can be taxed try taxing the sun although the odd men out who think the sun is far more important are mentioned in passing but not to worry at worst we will miss the polar lights henceforth somehow this doesnt feel very reassuring – after all if the maunder minimum was irrelevant to the climate then why was there a little ice age admittedly it remains an open question how important the suns activity is to the climate – after all if a complex system like the earths climate can not be successfully modeled this holds for the past as well as for the future it is not possible to state apodictically that the maunder minimum produced the little ice age intuitively though we tend to think that the sun is indeed an important factor on a geological time scale the last major ice age happened only a very short time ago and we know that there have been vast variations in average temperatures over large time scales in fact it is only because we live in a warming cycle on these large time scales an interglacial period that human civilization as we know it exists at all try to imagine feeding more than 7 billion people with the planet a full 8 to 10 degrees celsius colder and with a large part of its landmass covered in ice of course that is certainly not an imminent problem but looking at the regularity with which glacial and interglacial periods occur it seems obvious that it will become a problem one day we happen to think that even a mini ice age could be quite a nuisance it would definitely make life a lot more uncomfortable in the northern hemisphere currently there is no certainty what precisely the main cause of ice ages is but cycles related to the sun specifically the milankovitch cycles which describe changes in earths orbit around the sun are undoubtedly playing a role temperatures plus co2 and dust concentration in the atmosphere over the past 400000 odd years via the vostok ice core data and yes co2 tends to follow temperature it doesnt lead presumably there are feedback loops at work though with higher co2 concentration and temperature reinforcing each other during the up and downswings click to enlarge what is slightly worrisome about the above chart is that the very cold periods tend to have a much longer duration than the warm periods which seem to have a tendency to produce shortlived spike highs in fact the behavior of the long term temperature chart looks very similar to the price charts of a number of commodities conclusion the backtracking has begun – as a first step climate skeptics see their work suddenly integrated into the mainstream however we are not yet at the point where the models are rejected or the greenhouse gascentric agw theory is truly abandoned instead were now in the how can we keep saying we are right while were obviously wrong phase a lot is at stake after all scientific reputations but most importantly a lot of money policymakers dont want to hear that there is no problem because that would close off a major source of tax revenues as well as what is currently a major avenue for crony capitalism and pork barrel spending through the subsidization of uneconomic green energy schemes entire vast bureaucracies depend on agw as well and there is no alternative promotion in sight yet that could replace this sheer inexhaustible and vast fount of tax payer funded nonactivity so now the hope is that the heat is hiding out deep in the oceans and ready to return at the drop of a hat or rather a turn of the trade winds that may however not happen what then",

            "body": "live with dan abrams for dec 4 msnbc morning joe nbc news abrams yes but it also it defies—i dont believe it i mean its hard to believe that thats what happened rachel maddow air america well yes that the president wouldnt ask if mcconnell walks into his office and says weve got something big and new on iran the president looks up from his desk and goes oh really ok doesnt ask what it is you dont want that person in your leadership role abrams yes but it seems to me pretty clear rachel when you look at the timeline here they all are saying they knew about it in july they knew about it a few months ago and the president says today well you know what i only learned about it a week ago—they told me something was up but they didnt what it was first of all thats a little bit hard to believe in and of itself buchanan we now know that the intelligence community was dead wrong in 2005 when they said iran was driving for nuclear weapons and here we are in 2007 and the president was acting as though we had to go to war to stop a program thats been dormant for four years youve got an intelligence failure of enormous magnitude secondly a credibility problem in the white house and with the vice president and with the neoconservatives and everybody else when did they discover that the consensus in the intelligence community was moving toward the fact that it had been wrong for four years pat buchanan msnbc political analsyst well look the president has been stampeding the country toward a war with iran based on his belief if we didnt strike their nuclear installations or disarm them that we were headed for world war iii and a nuclear holocaust the question really here dan is the old one—what did the president know and when did he know it abrams im a lawyer the way you make a case is based on evidence instead as the evidence against iran falls apart somehow they claim it makes their case stronger joining us now is republican strategist jack burkman air america host rachel maddow and msnbc political analyst pat buchanan all right pat look we heard the president speak today he is trying to embrace this report as somehow proving that hes been right all along thats dishonesty isnt it vice president dick cheney united states the iranian regime needs to know that if stays on its present course the international community is prepared to impose serious consequences the united stated joins other nations in sending the clear message—we will not allow iran to have a nuclear weapon bush so i told people if youre interesting in avoiding world war iii it seems like you ought to be interesting in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon abrams ok well hadley says he learned of it quote a few months ago and its clear the president and vice president had not been standing down stephen hadley national security adviser when the president was told that we had some additional information he was basically said told stand down it needs to be evaluated abrams the problem thats not what the presidents national security adviser stephen hadley said yesterday pres george w bush united states no nobody ever told me that jim axelrod cbs news are you saying at no point while the rhetoric was escalating as world war iii was making it into the conversation at no point nobody from your intelligence team or your administration was saying maybe you want to back it down a little bit but first the bush administration in full spin mode tonight trying to somehow embrace a government intelligence report that says iran halted its nuclear weapons program as far back as 2003 meaning—iran is not the imminent nuclear threat the administration has been hyping for months the bush team now playing lawyerly tricks avoiding the real question that needs to be answered tonight which is—have they been dishonest about iran and their nuclear weapons program sound familiar after no weapons of mass destruction were found in iraq the administration changed the reasoning for that war in iraq theyre now asserting that this new report somehow proves theyve been right all along but today it became clear on the issue of what they knew when they knew it and what they said about it the administrations story does not add up and suspect drew petersons own words coming back to haunt him about the death of his third wife it seems hes never had a very good grip on reality and new studies haunting abstinence only proponents so why are taxpayers forced to spend more than ever not telling kids about reality dan abrams host tonight the presidents own words coming back to haunt him on iran as he tries to spin a blockbuster new report and new reality guests jack burkman rachel maddow valerie huber joel brodsky gina mendola longarzo larry kobilinsky pam bondi chris echegaray michelle suskauer steve ross maddow yes washington post reports that bush administration officials were getting briefed on this in july the white house admits that bush knew something in august but yet since august since july weve had the most rhetoric so even if they only knew that something was up and they didnt know what it was they should have dialed it back rather than ratcheting it up confrontation abrams all right jack now look dont i dont want to change the question here the question is not is iran dangerous or could iran be dangerous ok because everyone i think on this panel will concede that iran could be dangerous thats not the question the question is has the administration misled us in the last few months about irans nuclear capability jack burkman republican strategist no i think not in any way i think this if anything makes the presidents case stronger i think he was charitable today dan theres a very fine line between an intention to have a program and having a program these people have always intended to have a program what you have today is clear and convincing evidence for the first time that these people have a program you now have concrete evidence on the table the difference is and i think this will appeal to you you were making the analogy to a courtroom in your opening piece you cant make that analogy because the stakes here are higher if were wrong you could have hundreds of thousands of people killed what you have to understand is this at the end of the day is not north korea because north korea at the end of the day is chinas problem its russias problem it can be contained abrams yes but dont change the subject im not going to let you change the subject thats what all the bush team is trying to do theyre trying to change the subject away from whether theres been dishonesty and rachel i saw shaking your head it is infuriating i agree with you because i see you getting the notion that somehow this report proves theyve been right all along i mean the 2005 report suggested that iran had a nuclear program so this is not the first time were hearing about the possibility and the fact that they halted it in 2003 has to make us ask questions about what we were being told in 2007 maddow the only way you can understand this as a validation of what the white house has been saying is if you completely deny everything the white house has been saying what theyve been saying is that iran has a nuclear weapons program and that they aggressively want a nuclear weapon but national intelligence estimate rejects this and i quote with high confidence so i dont know how that means that proves the opposite of that is true burkman if i may dan the issue the white house did not that say that i think rachel mischaracterized what theyre saying what theyre saying is they are developing and working toward thats what dana perino said thats what stephen hadley had said maddow but no thats not what they said they dont want nuclear weapons abrams thats a dishonest representation of what i said go ahead pat i want you to buchanan look how can you credibly say iran is driving toward nuclear weapons when they voluntarily shut down their nuclear weapons program four years ago that tells me theyre thinking over whether they really want to have them if they shut down their secret program it means theyre not driving toward nuclear weapons and it means they may be enriching uranium for the reason that theyve got a right to do that under the treaty that they signed abrams and jack let me ask you this one how do you spin samuel bodman the energy secretarys comment on november 13th we are convinced that they are developing nuclear weapons whats ambiguous about that burkman i dont think you have to spin it because i think if you have in the recent past and three or four years ago is certainly the recent past somebody clearly working toward a program you have evidence of that abrams this is as youre saying again were now learning that this administration knew—im concerned about the dishonesty here because i think iran is a threat i really do but im concerned about being dishonest i want the truth from my government i dont want people spinning things and thats what i feel like has been happening even though they knew it and let me let pat take us inside buchanan i think its worse than that in this sense look we were driving straight toward an attack on iran the president and vice president and the neoconservatives were painting us into a corner where we had no choice but to destroy these nuclear facilities and if they knew they had shut down a program and they knew that the intelligence is saying look we may think the iranians backed off from this four years ago they were stampeding us toward war the same way it was done in 2003 abrams go ahead jack burkman you see dan the margin for error is zero this is a guy whos committed to the destruction of israel the president of iran is committed to the destruction of israel quote on his words i want to wipe israel off the map abrams but youre changing the subject again jack the subject is not is look we can talk about whether iran is a threat iran is a possible threat alright no question about it the question is whether we have been lied to as of late let me play you two pieces of sound jack i want to ask you if this make you nervous this is comparing the president talking about iraq in 2005 and talking about iran now bush iran was dangerous iran is dangerous and iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon we did find out that he had the intent and the capability of making weapons which in my judgment still made him a dangerous man and the world understood how dangerous saddam hussein was we talked about iran and the desire to work jointly to convince the iranian regime to give up their nuclear weapons abrams i didnt need the last piece of sound there jack you listen to the talk about the dangerous man—its a little bit frightening and it goes to pats point about being on this sort of road to war burkman let me respond specifically to your legal question i think it is an appropriate question i dont see dan a material distinction between an intention to develop a nuclear program and actually developing a program when when that party has already engaged in moving toward developing a program abrams no that ignores the significance rachel of this new report maddow yes you can not make a case to the american people that we ought to invade a country because theres a bad man there or somebody who once had a nuclear thought the case they were making to us about attacking iran was that iran posed an imminent danger because of this nuclear weapons program that we now know doesnt exist the evidence is bunk abrams right pat final word ive got to wrap it up buchanan were headed for war because we could not take the risk and there was as far as we know now no risk there abrams and we were and i am concerned about the credibility factor i dont want that to be lost on this dont let them change the subject theyve got to answer the question have they been telling us the truth jack burkman pat buchanan rachel maddow thanks burkman thanks abrams coming up next the evidence is in abstinenceonly education programs dont seem to work but that hasnt stopped the president and many others from asking taxpayers for an additional 28 million in funding and later breaking news in the stacy peterson case tonight police are searching the home she shared with suspect and husband drew plus spirit airlines getting heat over their milf promotion they say no one ever educated them about else quote milf can mean that scored them a place in tonights winners and losers abrams did you know one in 16 have signed so called virginity pledges 88 percent of them break that vow before they marry coming up new study has proven that abstinence only education does not work that hasnt stop the bush administration from asking for a 28 million funding increase for the programs we debate that abrams a new study says abstinenceonly education programs dont work so how would that possibly justify a 28 million increase in federal funding for these programs a recent national study included that no evidence exists that abstinence programs delay the initiation of sex or reduce the number of sexual partners among teens this comes on the heels of a long awaited congressional report released in april that also found that teaching abstinence didnt decrease the likelihood that teens would have sex so are those in congress who know these programs dont work are you using them as bait to trade with hardcore conservatives who would like them to work the taxpayers are stuck with a nearly 200 million bill for it here now is valerie huber executive director of the national abstinence education association and rachel maddow is still with us all right rachel let me start with you i mean it seems absurd to me that democrats in congress cant say were going to cut it off instead theyre using it as bait and constantly saying oh you know well trade you well keep in the money for the abstinenceonly program maddow yes im hoping that this is a trick because i understand why the bush administration would ask for this money they have pushed for this for a long time and they have resisted all of the scientific evidence to the contrary that this is a waste of money or maybe even harmful but the democratic congress to go along with it im hoping theres something i dont understand about it because otherwise theres no depending it abrams all right valerie look i know youre going to tell that you disagree with some of these new studies look i believe the evidence is pretty clear that comprehensive sex education is probably more effective in reducing pregnancy sexually transmitted diseases and et cetera but lets even assume that theres a disagreement why do you think then that 14 states are refusing federal funding for abstinenceonly programs valerie huber natl abstinence education assoc well we know its a part of a coordinated plan by a historic opponent of abstinence education that through misinformation and misguided selective science regarding abstinence education they are convincing governors that this is not a good plan abrams so the congressional study wasnt true huber we know that that there are a number of reports that show that abstinence education is effective abrams the congressional—lets talk about the congressional study that one isnt true i mean it says that really that there was no evidence that it works huber well actually what that study does reveal is that abstinence education we need to have more of it rather than less abrams wait because it doesnt work so weve got to have more of it to make it not work even more huber actually if you look at the study what it reveals is that you can not present abstinence education one time to young teens and expect it to have a stick factor it has to be continued and reinforced throughout their difficult adolescent years maddow inaudible im sorry to interrupt you id just interject for a moment that i feel like what we have learned about abstinenceonly education is that not only is it not effective at either delaying or stopping young people from having sexual intercourse but by pairing it with abstinence—by making abstinence only approach people receiving that form of information get less information about pregnancy stds and hivs and it makes them more susceptible to those things huber actually thats not abrams valerie go ahead maddow i didnt argue that it didnt work i will argue is that its harmful huber actually thats not true at all abstinence education is a holistic method that provides information on relationship building and accurate information on stds and yes accurate information on contraception all within the discussion of why abstinence is the best choice abrams wait lets be honest what you mean by talking about what theyre teaching about the use of condoms et cetera is that they dont work right abstinenceonly only talks about the failure rate of condoms huber abstinence education provides a realistic and accurate discussion of contraception all within the context of why abstinence is the best choice teens are presented all the information necessary to make wise decisions abrams what do you do about the fact that 58 percent lets put up this number set here 34 percent of us teens have premarital sex by the age of 20 58 percent of teens have had sex before the age of 18 14 percent of teens report of having sex with four or more people how do you deal i mean your argument would be you want to reduce the number from 58 percent before the age of 18 but now lets deal with the reality and that is that 58 percent of them are having sex before the age of 18 i guess that the position of abstinenceonly is to just go like this and say oh please tell me theyre not going to do it i hope theyre not going to do it huber no the reality is that teens are resonating with the message of abstinence education in increasing numbers theres trend data to show more and more teens are abstaining abrams thats not what the study show youre losing on the studies you are huber no thats not true in fact a recent study just released showed abrams from who before you tell me what the study is who did the study huber virginias abstinence education program state of virginia abrams right huber and actually showed that teens engaged in an abstinence education program were half as likely to abrams virginia one of the states thats refused federal funding if i was correct maddow whenever i evaluate myself i turn out to be doing awesome as well so thats—i think its important—there was a congressionally mandated study that looked at abstinenceonly programs over 10 years on the national level and it was the result of that study that told us that abstinenceonly does not work to delay or stop teens from having sex before they get married they just dont work and so if abstinence doesnt work its a waste of money if abstinence programs are being used to substitute for program that actually give people usable information about contraception and stds and hiv and they are killing people they are not just expensive abrams valerie you get the final word on this huber teens receive all the information necessary to make a good decision recording their sexual health and the misinformation regarding abstinence education that are other guest has been communicating is not at all consistent with what is taught in abstinence education programs abrams all right i will say this 200 million whatever you think of this ladies and gentlemen is at the very least controversy 200 million for a program that is the very least controversial doesnt seem to me to be a very good use of taxpayer dollars huber actually abrams but valerie huber rachel maddow thanks a lot for joining huber thank you abrams coming up breaking news in the stacy peterson case tonight police now searching the home that she shared with suspect husband drew its happening as we speak and bill oreilly complaining at the corrupt media drove the don imus story i guess you forgot that someone on his own network takes credit for exposing the i man that revelation coming up next in beat the press abrams its time for tonights beat the press our daily look back at the absurd and sometimes amusing perils of live tv first up last night bill oreilly was complaining about who drove the don imus story back in april bill oreilly tv host the corrupt media and thats what drove this is the internet smear site that drove this whole thing it wasnt you it wasnt any honest broker of information abrams this is one of those times bill oreilly is absolutely right at least one person in the corrupt media did drive it fox host john gibson said bragged on april 10th quote a fox radio program mine pointed out what the morning host said last wednesday so according to john gibson he was the first or at least one of the first to point out what imus said oreillys right it did not come from an honest broker of information next up since the end of october weve known drew peterson wife stacy is missing and his third wife is dead sometimes theres an ambiguity on how to define breaking news and then sometimes theres not this is what cnn headline news considered quote breaking in that case last night one dead one missing sixweekold breaking news from cnn finally the folks over at 60 minutes probably think theyre all household names but steve kroft learned the hard way from will smiths childhood teacher that in truth to most people all those 60 minutes folks are interchangeable steve morley safer whoever unidentified male youre on 60 minutes unidentified female youre morley steve kroft no im steve unidentified female steve abrams yes i thought she almost said maury if she says maury povich i dont know unless i didnt inaudible we need your help beating the press if you see anything right or wrong amusing absurd go to our web site abramsmsnbccom leave us a tip in the box please include the show and the time you saw the item up next breaking news in the stacy peterson case at this time police are now searching the property that she shared with husband drew who is now a suspect in her disappearance there are cadaversniffing dogs at the scene and later debra la faye the infamous teacher who slept with a 14yearold busted again abrams coming up former florida teacher and convicted sex offender debra lafave busted again and supreme court justice antonin scalia caught off guard commenting on of all things whether oj simpson killed his wife and a new study shows that chimps have better memories than humans in tonights winners and losers the breaking news tonight police executing a search warrant this evening on drew petersons property now peterson was at the home while police executed the search they used cadaversniffing dogs joining me on the phone right now as this is happening is drew petersons attorney joel brodsky joel thank you for joining us i appreciate it all right so were reading from reports that they executed a search warrant on his home are you saying it was not on his home joel brodsky drew petersons attorney on the phone no i have a copy of the search warrant right here in my hand they delivered a warrant to him at his home about the search warrant was only in regards to the cars the dark blue gmc denali and the 2002 purple pontiac grand prix it has nothing to do with his home abrams this report says they seized two cars computers eight handguns three long guns and ammunition true brodsky that was done in the warrant that was served back when the house the first warrant for the house which is back november 6th of 07 abrams but the two cars is something that was new brodsky no the two cars were originally taken by a warrant that was issued maybe about a week after the november 6th warrant and now this is the fourth warrant that was just given to us today which is fairly extreme as far as the number of warrants go that ive ever seen abrams all right joel if you could stand by for a minute brodsky sure abrams let me bring in my panel weve got gina mendola longarzo larry kobilinsky and pam bondi all right pam youre the prosecutor on this panel you heard joel saying that this is a very unusual the amount of the search warrants now being executed theyve now gone back to his home tonight to execute a search warrant with regard to his car unusual pam bondi prosecutor no dan not if they keep receiving new information and theyre being sure that its done properly by going back to a judge keeping the information fresh the search warrant fresh so no not at all and its a great sign for prosecutors in that they must feel that they have more evidence and that it must be linked to him abrams larry what do you think theyre looking for larry kobilinsky forensic scientist well they may have no evidence from the home they may be looking for the possibility that she was transported in the vehicle obviously just finding her dna there is not enough her hair her fibers theyre looking for any indication that there was violence that took place abrams all right gina hang on for one second weve got nbcs alison kartevold on the phone who was just there at the home allison i understand you actually got to speak to drew peterson what did he say alison kartevold nbc reporter well i went up to drews door and knocked on it by the time i got here there were no official vehicles or anything happening and i asked him whether or not a search warrant had been executed on his home this evening and he said no he said that they had not executed a search warrant tonight and i said what was it that they brought to you the paper that they brought and he i asked if it was a subpoena for someone in the house and he said no he said that was just paperwork for my attorney no big deal abrams and then he closed the door and said goodbye kartevold yes brodsky dan i have to disagree with your panelist that this is a good sign to me this is the second warrant for the car and the cars and if they had found something on the third warrant they wouldnt need a fourth warrant to me this shows that theyre continuing to execute search warrants and theyre not finding anything abrams but gina that is fairly standard procedure in cases where they follow up with search warrants or second warrants sometimes they didnt get everything they needed et cetera gina mendola longarzo defense attorney yes exactly they have to follow up on all leads i tend to agree with mr brodsky because so far it doesnt look like they have much of anything theyre looking for a smoke gun theyre looking for a clue here because they dont have a body and they need something abrams let me direct this to mr brodsky how would you know whether they dont have anything brodsky well as i said this is the second search warrant for the same property for the cars the language you know the boilerplate language in these warrants is relatively same looking for trace evidence fibers et cetera et cetera so if they were able to find it in the third warrant they didnt find it in the third warrant theyve issued the fourth warrant i believe because i filed a motion to get the cars back and this is their response this is their attempt to justify keeping the cars longer in an attempt to hope that they can develop something because they have nothing up to date abrams pam what do you make of that bondi you know dan its what you just said we just dont know yet and whats happening is they want to do a very very thorough search he did file a motion to get the cars back so that was good defense work on his part but again they may now be taking that car completely apart weve had cases where you can find a drop of blood way underneath the carpet in the car so maybe that is what theyre doing its simply more thorough abrams and larry thats what they have to be they have to find something incriminating because she lived with him so finding her dna in the car in and of itself is not anything kobilinsky her mere presence in the car is meaningless they need to find some evidence of some force some aggressive activity for example if they find a clump of hair that was pulled the evidence would be the hair has roots that would be an indication that something violent took place obviously blood is another indication it would have to be in a large enough amount but thats what theyre looking for in lots of nooks and crannies in the car abrams gina look mr brodsky can answer this because he is the attorney and now im asking you in sort of the macro picture if you were his attorney youd be worried wouldnt you youve got the third wife problem youve got the fourth wife problem youve got another search warrant being executed tonight longarzo yes i would be worried but also they dont have a body here and we still dont know what their defense is the best advice i would say at this point for the defense is to say nothing dont give any statements the fifth amendment right is sacred its crucial and it has to be preserved abrams that brings me to an interesting question joel i want to ask you about this you wrote a note to fox news an angry note about an appearance you made on fox news and one of the things that you said is with regard to the timeline and whether you would talk about exactly what he was doing that night you said the only way i will even consider addressing this issue is if the illinois state police release their report of the interview mr peterson gave them shortly after stacys disappearance mr peterson will not repeat himself look i understand as a lawyer your position is going to be echoing what gina just said which is you want to minimize the number of statements that you have publicly about what he did but i think that many in the public are going to say look if hes innocent and his wife is missing why wouldnt he say i was here and then i went here and this might help us find my missing wife brodsky well i dont know you know drew has always said that beating the bushes or looking in ponds is not going to find his missing wife because shes run away but that being said he sat down and gave the illinois state police a full and complete accounting and a full and complete statement of what occurred during the relevant period of time the human language is an imperfect tool and to start repeating yourself is nothing but incriminating and hes not going to do it abrams can you tell us what it is he said to the illinois state police about his whereabouts brodsky no i mean i havent read the reports he gave them a very full it was a very long interview it was a very complete interview a very thorough interview and i dont know all the details id like to get a copy of that report but theyre not going to release it to me until and unless theres a charge abrams so your concern would be lets be honest here your concern would be in saying what he was doing that night you might say something that might be slightly inconsistent with what he said intentionally or unintentionally brodsky yes well it wouldnt be intentionally it would be unintentionally and it would also be because what were dealing with is human language and human memory and human recollection which is very imperfect you say it once you lay it out you cooperate you make your statement you tell your story and thats it youve told it and youre not going to repeat yourself and thats the way it is abrams you know pam i hear joel is a lawyer i see gina here nodding as a lawyer i get that i get why lawyers would be giving this legal advice i hear them both but i think that a lot of people are still going to say thats the lawyer speaking what about the grieving husband speaking whos going to go out and say again and again heres where i was i want my lovely stacy back now i guess the argument would be that well if she supposedly said to him i left with some other guy that he just wanted to kind of go away pam bondi exactly dan and you know fundamentally what do we want to know we want to know the truth thats all theyre seeking is the truth and the problem with his statement is hes being very selective and i agree with gina the right to remain silent thats one of our most precious protected rights however hes coming out giving all these interviews selectively hes saying what he wants to say and then he comes back and says well i dont want to say this so i think he does i think he should come out and say where he was and what time abrams i mean joel hes got enough time to go on the air and bash his exwives and you can go on and you can be very critical of all the witnesses who seem to be becoming forward with potentially incriminating evidence against your client and yet neither he nor you can go on and offer something as basic as a timeline as to what he was doing that night brodsky well like i said he gave a timeline he gave it to the authorities which are the relevant parties but when youre talking about drew wanting the search i always find it a little bit disingenuous because the authorities have decided in their own minds that shes in a pond or a pool or in a field somewhere and thats where theyre limiting their search if they were trying to be openminded they would also be searching as a missing person seeing if shes in saskatchewan or up in alaska or down in cancun hiding out somewhere but right now their focus is theyre convinced theyve already decided that theres been a criminal act and i think that thats the problem abrams but mr brodsky they can give up on the search for the third wife right shes dead brodsky correct abrams ok brodsky what i mean abrams yes i know brodsky but they all right abrams joel brodsky alison kartevold and thank you to everyone on the panel i appreciate it up next former teacher debra lafave admitted to having sex with a 14yearold student she was busted again today and later are you smarter than a monkey a new report actually says chimps have better memories than humans they did a test its unbelievable in winners and losers tonight abrams did you know almost 10 percent of us public school students have received unwanted sexual attention from school employees coming up debra lafave the teacher infamous for having sex with a 14yearold is busted again abrams tonight former teacher debra lafave has been busted again in 2004 the then 23yearold lafave drew national attention after she admitted having sex with her 14yearold student she pled guilty to lewd and lascivious behavior sentenced to three years house arrest and seven years probation well today she was busted for violating that probation the violation report says she had numerous nonworkrelated conversations with a 17yearold girl she worked with in a minute well talk about whether she should have been arrested but first lafave long ago admitted that what she did was wrong debra lafave convicted sex offender i came on this show to tell my side of the story and all im being is truthful im going to be the first person to say yes its my fault and im dealing with that he consented but i should have been the one to say look you are a kid and this is not a good idea whether you want it or not matt lauer host the today show you should have said it on a number of occasions lafave oh yes lauer you should have said it when you first started flirting with him and you clearly should have said it before you had sex with this young man lafave clearly i committed a sex offense but im not a sex offender even though im labeled as that i made a really really really bad choice lauer you dont see yourself as a predator lafave its hard it is so hard because i lived 23 years of my life you know knowing who i was i was a kindhearted person who loved children who would never do anything to break the law i was a good person and then now everything has just changed so its just really hard for me to accept that i think i should be in jail lauer you think you should be lafave yes by the standards what i did thats the law i should have gotten jail time abrams all right well now she may she violated a condition whats known as 69 of her probation meaning she had contact with a minor a 17yearold coworker joining us now is chris echegaray a reporter with the tampa tribune chris thanks a lot i appreciate it what happened here chris echegaray reporter tampa tribune thank you well according to the arrest report deb lafave was speaking to an underage coworker about family issues boyfriend issues sexualrelated issues and that conversation violated the term of her probation abrams where was she working echegaray she was working at danny boys as a waitress in sun city center for almost two years without incident according to the manager scott griffin who i interviewed earlier today abrams and they liked her they thought she was doing well echegaray clean record always punctual very pleasant good worker rave reviews from scott griffin he claims that this was a complete surprise he was unaware of what was going on he claims there was no lack of supervision when lafave was there he claims the 17yearold female coworker did not complain about the conversations to him and despite it all he claims that this is a big surprise abrams let me bring in michelle suskauer here all right look michelle technically i guess this is a violation of the probation shes not supposed to be in contact this is a 17yearold coworker who shes talking to about life michelle suskauer defense attorney whos going to be 18 right shes going to be 18 in january abrams so she really needs to go they really need to send her back i mean look whether you think they should have gotten jail time in the first place separate question she didnt so now are they actually going to try to put her away for talking to an almost 18yearold at a restaurant suskauer well its completely up to the judge and the standard dan is a knowing and willful violation so did she know that this girl was 17 and was this a willful violation and its really easy to prove a violation of probation in florida its to the conscience of the court so it depends on abrams shes not allowed to talk about nonworkrelated issues right suskauer right abrams so that means when shes at work at the restaurant if they talk about anything apart from forks knives and napkins shes in violation of her probation suskauer well you know it looks like she may have taken it a little bit further than that if shes talking about and sure if they want to prove this theyre going to have to bring this girl in or someone who overheard this conversation what were they talking about boyfriends sexualrelated issues it really look dan weve abrams ive got to go michelle but look i think its time to end this michelle suskauer and chris echegaray thanks a lot i appreciate it suskauer thanks abrams up next in winners and losers spirit airlines gets some heat over their milf promotion supreme court justice antonin scalia says that oj simpson killed his wife and a 5yearold chimp beats college students in shortterm memory tests an airline that keeps a controversial ad a smart judge who agrees oj

our first winner spirit airlines the discount flier getting extra ink over its new promotion called milf many islands low fares offering up to 9 flights to the caribbean airline officials now swear they had no idea the term milf could possibly have another meaning unidentified actor milf mom id like to expletive deleted unidentified male yes abrams despite the ads intriguing island alignment the

groups across the state our second winner democratic presidential candidate bill richardson the white house hopeful just scored the endorsement of a former us president martin sheen as president josiah bartlet in this building when the president stands nobody sits abrams all right all right its the endorsement of martin sheen who played one on tv not reality our second loser supreme court justice antonin scalia caught offguard today endorsing the reality that oj simpson killed his wife when discussing another case at the court the simpson case was mentioned and scalia said its also a case in which a man killed his wife with a knife tom cruise actor i want the truth jack nicholson you cant handle the truth abrams nice to hear the usually guarded supreme court justice is offering up some straight talk but the big loser of the day employees at a papa johns pizza parlor in florence alabama who allegedly sprinkled a little something extra on top of a pie they delivered to a local church group police say the pie was peppered with pot no word on whether any of the group are now suffering shortterm memory loss the big winner of the day chimps whose shortterm memory may actually be better than humans aiamuph was one of those who dominated his human counterparts in this memory test the numbers one to nine flashed on the screen for a fraction of a second the chimps managed to remember the arrangement 80 percent of the time their collegeage competitors only 40 percent so this may actually prove that in some ways the simians are smarter than the humans here is now is ape research expert steve ross from chicagos lincoln park zoo steve thanks for joining us i appreciate it this is a little hard for many people to believe that in some ways chimps may actually be smarter steve ross ape research expert lincoln park zoo well its a remarkable finding really it challenges some of the longtime assumptions that humans hold cognitive abilities that are far superior than all other animals abrams is there any other explanation here i mean how do you think the researchers could possibly explain how the chimps may in this particular way be quote smarter ross well i think its long known that chimpanzees and some other species such as dolphins have highly advanced cognitive abilities these chimpanzees in particular have longterm training that theyve been working with and i think its interesting to show and to challenge these types of assumptions about human intelligence and animal intelligence abrams look here is someone who has obviously spent a lot of time with chimps unlike most of us were you surprised when you heard they didnt just do as well or they didnt just do well on a memory test but they actually did twice as well as humans ross yes the youngest chimps did best of all they were able to complete the task much quicker than human subjects and although this is a little bit surprising having seen these chimps in action and worked with chimps for a while there is some element of expectation for the performance of these chimps and other chimps like them abrams really so this didnt come as a big surprise ross no we work with chimpanzees and gorillas at lincoln park zoo on touch screen work and every day we see them perform things we wouldnt expect in the meantime abrams wow unbelievable stuff steve ross from chicagos lincoln park zoo thanks a lot i appreciate it ross thanks dan abrams thats all the time we have for tonight up next is the dock block i will see you here tomorrow this is a rush transcript this copy may not be in its final form and

            "text": "ABRAMS:  Yes but it also, it defies—I don‘t believe it.  I mean, it‘s hard to believe that that‘s what happened.\n\nRACHEL MADDOW, AIR AMERICA:  Well, yes, that the president wouldn‘t ask, if McConnell walks into his office and says, we‘ve got something big and new on Iran the president looks up from his desk and goes, oh, really, OK.  Doesn‘t ask what it is.  You don‘t want that person in your leadership role.\n\nABRAMS:  Yes, but it seems to me pretty clear, Rachel, when you look at the timeline here, they all are saying they knew about it in July, they knew about it a few months ago.  And the president says today, well, you know what?  I only learned about it a week ago—they told me something was up but they didn‘t what it was.  First of all, that‘s a little bit hard to believe in and of itself?\n\nBUCHANAN:  We now know that the intelligence community was dead wrong in 2005 when they said Iran was driving for nuclear weapons and here we are in 2007 and the president was acting as though we had to go to war to stop a program that‘s been dormant for four years.  You‘ve got an intelligence failure of enormous magnitude.  Secondly, a credibility problem in the White House and with the vice president and with the neoconservatives and everybody else.  When did they discover that the consensus in the intelligence community was moving toward the fact that it had been wrong for four years?\n\nPAT BUCHANAN, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALSYST:  Well, look, the president has been stampeding the country toward a war with Iran based on his belief if we didn‘t strike their nuclear installations or disarm them that we were headed for World War III and a nuclear holocaust.  The question really here Dan, is the old one—what did the president know and when did he know it?\n\nABRAMS:  I‘m a lawyer.  The way you make a case is based on evidence.  Instead, as the evidence against Iran falls apart, somehow they claim it makes their case stronger.  Joining us now is Republican strategist, Jack Burkman, Air America host, Rachel Maddow and MSNBC political analyst, Pat Buchanan.  All right.  Pat, look, we heard the president speak today, he is trying to embrace this report as somehow proving that he‘s been right all along.  That‘s dishonesty, isn‘t it?\n\nVICE PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY, UNITED STATES:  The Iranian regime needs to know that if stays on its present course, the international community is prepared to impose serious consequences.  The United Stated joins other nations in sending the clear message—we will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.\n\nBUSH:  So, I told people, if you‘re interesting in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought to be interesting in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon.\n\nABRAMS:  OK.  Well, Hadley says he learned of it, quote, “A few months ago and it‘s clear the president and vice president had not been standing down.”\n\nSTEPHEN HADLEY, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  When the president was told that we had some additional information, he was basically said told, stand down, it needs to be evaluated.\n\nABRAMS:  The problem, that‘s not what the president‘s National Security Adviser, Stephen Hadley said yesterday.\n\nPRES. GEORGE W. BUSH, UNITED STATES:  No, nobody ever told me that.\n\nJIM AXELROD, CBS NEWS:  Are you saying at no point while the rhetoric was escalating as World War III was making it into the conversation, at no point nobody from your intelligence team or your administration was saying, maybe you want to back it down a little bit?\n\nBut first: The Bush administration in full spin mode tonight, trying to somehow embrace a government intelligence report that says Iran halted its nuclear weapons program as far back as 2003, meaning—Iran is not the imminent nuclear threat the administration has been hyping for months.  The Bush team now playing lawyerly tricks, avoiding the real question that needs to be answered tonight which is—have they been dishonest about Iran and their nuclear weapons program?  Sound familiar?  After no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, the administration changed the reasoning for that war in Iraq.  They‘re now asserting that this new report somehow proves they‘ve been right all along.  But today, it became clear on the issue of what they knew, when they knew it and what they said about it, the administration‘s story does not add up.\n\nAnd: Suspect Drew Peterson‘s own words coming back to haunt him about the death of his third wife.  It seems he‘s never had a very good grip on reality.\n\nAnd: New studies haunting abstinence only proponents.  So why are taxpayers forced to spend more than ever not telling kids about reality.\n\nDAN ABRAMS, HOST:  Tonight: The president‘s own words coming back to haunt him on Iran as he tries to spin a blockbuster new report and new reality.\n\nGuests: Jack Burkman, Rachel Maddow, Valerie Huber, Joel Brodsky, Gina Mendola Longarzo, Larry Kobilinsky, Pam Bondi, Chris Echegaray, Michelle Suskauer, Steve Ross\n\nMADDOW:  Yes, “Washington Post” reports that Bush administration officials were getting briefed on this in July.  The White House admits that Bush knew something in August but yet, since August, since July, we‘ve had the most rhetoric.  So, even if they only knew that something was up and they didn‘t know what it was, they should have dialed it back rather than ratcheting it up confrontation.\n\nABRAMS:  All right.  Jack, now look, don‘t - I don‘t want to change the question here.  The question is not - is Iran dangerous or could Iran be dangerous, OK?  Because  everyone, I think, on this panel will concede that Iran could be dangerous.  That‘s not the question.  The question is - has the administration misled us in the last few months about Iran‘s nuclear capability?\n\nJACK BURKMAN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  No, I think not in any way.  I think this, if anything, makes the president‘s case stronger.  I think he was charitable today, Dan.  There‘s a very fine line between an intention to have a program and having a program.  These people have always intended to have a program.  What you have today is clear and convincing evidence for the first time that these people have a program.  You now have concrete evidence on the table.  The difference is, and I think this will appeal to you, you were making the analogy to a courtroom in your opening piece.  You can‘t make that analogy because the stakes here are higher.  If we‘re wrong, you could have hundreds of thousands of people killed.  What you have to understand is this at the end of the day is not North Korea because North Korea at the end of the day is China‘s problem, it‘s Russia‘s problem, it can be contained.\n\nABRAMS:  Yes, but don‘t change the subject.  I‘m not going to let you change the subject.  That‘s what all the Bush team is trying to do.  They‘re trying to change the subject away from whether there‘s been dishonesty.  And Rachel, I saw shaking your head.  It is infuriating, I agree with you because I see you getting the notion that somehow this report proves they‘ve been right all along.  I mean, the 2005 report suggested that Iran had a nuclear program.  So, this is not the first time we‘re hearing about the possibility.  And the fact that they halted it in 2003, has to make us ask questions about what we were being told in 2007?\n\nMADDOW:  The only way you can understand this as a validation of what the White House has been saying is if you completely deny everything the White House has been saying.  What they‘ve been saying is that Iran has a nuclear weapons program and that they aggressively want a nuclear weapon.  But National Intelligence Estimate rejects this and I quote, “With high confidence.”  So, I don‘t know how that means that proves the opposite of that is true.\n\nBURKMAN:  If I may Dan.  The issue - the White House did not that say that.  I think Rachel mischaracterized what they‘re saying.  What they‘re saying is they are developing and working toward.  That‘s what Dana Perino said, that‘s what Stephen Hadley had said.\n\nMADDOW:  But no, that‘s not what they said.  They don‘t want nuclear weapons.\n\nABRAMS:  That‘s a dishonest representation of what I said.  Go ahead,\n\nPat.  I want you to -\n\nBUCHANAN:  Look, how can you credibly say Iran is driving toward nuclear weapons when they voluntarily shut down their nuclear weapons program four years ago?  That tells me they‘re thinking over whether they really want to have them.  If they shut down their secret program, it means they‘re not driving toward nuclear weapons.  And it means they may be enriching uranium for the reason that they‘ve got a right to do that under the treaty that they signed.\n\nABRAMS:  And Jack, let me ask you this one, how do you spin Samuel Bodman, the Energy secretary‘s comment on November 13th - “We are convinced that they are developing nuclear weapons.”  What‘s ambiguous about that?\n\nBURKMAN:  I don‘t think you have to spin it because I think if you have in the recent past, and three or four years ago is certainly the recent past, somebody clearly working toward a program, you have evidence of that.\n\nABRAMS:  This is - as you‘re saying - again, we‘re now learning that this administration knew—I‘m concerned about the dishonesty here because I think Iran is a threat, I really do.  But I‘m concerned about being dishonest.  I want the truth from my government.  I don‘t want people spinning things.  And that‘s what I feel like has been happening even though they knew it.  And let me let Pat take us inside.\n\nBUCHANAN:  I think it‘s worse than that in this sense.  Look, we were driving straight toward an attack on Iran.  The president and vice president and the neoconservatives were painting us into a corner where we had no choice but to destroy these nuclear facilities.  And if they knew they had shut down a program and they knew that the intelligence is saying, look, we may think the Iranians backed off from this four years ago, they were stampeding us toward war, the same way it was done in 2003.\n\nABRAMS:  Go ahead, jack.\n\nBURKMAN:  You see, Dan, the margin for error is zero.  This is a guy who‘s committed to the destruction of Israel.  The president of Iran is committed to the destruction of Israel quote on his words, “I want to wipe Israel off the map.\n\nABRAMS:  But you‘re changing the subject again, Jack.  The subject is not is - look, we can talk about whether Iran is a threat.  Iran is a possible threat, alright?  No question about it.  The question is whether we have been lied to as of late.  Let me play you two pieces of sound, Jack.  I want to ask you if this make you nervous?  This is comparing the president talking about Iraq in 2005 and talking about Iran now.\n\nBUSH:  Iran was dangerous.  Iran is dangerous and Iran will be dangerous if they have the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon.\n\nWe did find out that he had the intent and the capability of making weapons, which in my judgment still made him a dangerous man and the world understood how dangerous Saddam Hussein was.\n\nWe talked about Iran and the desire to work jointly to convince the\n\nIranian regime to give up their nuclear weapons -\n\nABRAMS:  I didn‘t need the last piece of sound there, Jack.  You listen to the talk about the dangerous man—it‘s a little bit frightening and it goes to Pat‘s point about being on this sort of road to war.\n\nBURKMAN:  Let me respond specifically to your legal question.  I think it is an appropriate question.  I don‘t see, Dan, a material distinction between an intention to develop a nuclear program and actually developing a program when, when that party has already engaged in moving toward developing a program.\n\nABRAMS:  No, that ignores the significance, Rachel, of this new report.\n\nMADDOW:  Yes, you cannot make a case to the American people that we ought to invade a country because there‘s a bad man there or somebody who once had a nuclear thought.  The case they were making to us about attacking Iran was that Iran posed an imminent danger because of this nuclear weapons program that we now know doesn‘t exist.  The evidence is bunk.\n\nABRAMS:  Right.  Pat, final word, I‘ve got to wrap it up.\n\nBUCHANAN:  We‘re headed for war because we could not take the risk and there was, as far as we know now, no risk there.\n\nABRAMS:  And we were and I am concerned about the credibility factor.\n\nI don‘t want that to be lost on this.  Don‘t let them change the subject.\n\nThey‘ve got to answer the question, have they been telling us the truth?\n\nJack Burkman, Pat Buchanan, Rachel Maddow, thanks.\n\nBURKMAN:  Thanks.\n\nABRAMS:  Coming up next: The evidence is in; abstinence-only education programs don‘t seem to work.  But that hasn‘t stopped the president and many others from asking taxpayers for an additional $28 million in funding.\n\nAnd later: Breaking news in the Stacy Peterson case.  Tonight, police are searching the home she shared with suspect and husband, Drew.\n\nPlus: Spirit airlines getting heat over their MILF promotion.  They say no one ever educated them about else, quote, “MILF can mean.”  That scored them a place in tonight‘s Winners and Losers.\n\nABRAMS:  Did you know one in 16 have signed so called virginity pledges, 88 percent of them break that vow before they marry.  Coming up:\n\nNew study has proven that abstinence only education does not work, that hasn‘t stop the Bush administration from asking for a $28 million funding increase for the programs.  We debate that.\n\nABRAMS:  A new study says abstinence-only education programs don‘t work.  So, how would that possibly justify a $28 million increase in Federal funding for these programs?  A recent national study included that no evidence exists that abstinence programs delay the initiation of sex or reduce the number of sexual partners among teens.  This comes on the heels of a long awaited congressional report released in April that also found that teaching abstinence didn‘t decrease the likelihood that teens would have sex.  So, are those in Congress who know these programs don‘t work are you using them as bait to trade with hardcore conservatives who would like them to work.  The taxpayers are stuck with a nearly $200 million bill for it.  Here now is Valerie Huber, executive director of the National Abstinence Education Association and Rachel Maddow is still with us.  All right.  Rachel, let me start with you.  I mean, it seems absurd to me that Democrats in Congress can‘t say, we‘re going to cut it off.  Instead they‘re using it as bait and constantly saying, oh, you know, we‘ll trade you, we‘ll keep in the money for the abstinence-only program.\n\nMADDOW:  Yes, I‘m hoping that this is a trick because I understand why the Bush administration would ask for this money.  They have pushed for this for a long time and they have resisted all of the scientific evidence to the contrary that this is a waste of money or maybe even harmful.  But the Democratic Congress to go along with it, I‘m hoping there‘s something I don‘t understand about it because otherwise, there‘s no depending it.\n\nABRAMS:  All right.  Valerie, look, I know you‘re going to tell that you disagree with some of these new studies.  Look, I believe the evidence is pretty clear that comprehensive sex education is probably more effective in reducing pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and et cetera.  But let‘s even assume that there‘s a disagreement.  Why do you think then that 14 states are refusing Federal funding for abstinence-only programs?\n\nVALERIE HUBER, NAT‘L. ABSTINENCE EDUCATION ASSOC.:  Well, we know it‘s a part of a coordinated plan by a historic opponent of abstinence education that through misinformation and misguided selective science regarding abstinence education they are convincing governors that this is not a good plan.\n\nABRAMS:  So, the congressional study wasn‘t true?\n\nHUBER:  We know that - that there are a number of reports that show\n\nthat abstinence education is effective -\n\nABRAMS:  The congressional—let‘s talk about the congressional study.  That one isn‘t true?  I mean, it says that really that there was no evidence that it works?\n\nHUBER:  Well, actually what that study does reveal is that abstinence education, we need to have more of it rather than less.\n\nABRAMS:  Wait, because it doesn‘t work, so we‘ve got to have more of it to make it not work even more?\n\nHUBER:  Actually if you look at the study, what it reveals is that you cannot present abstinence education one time to young teens and expect it to have a stick factor, it has to be continued and reinforced throughout their difficult adolescent years.\n\nMADDOW:  (INAUDIBLE) I‘m sorry to interrupt you, I‘d just interject for a moment that I feel like what we have learned about abstinence-only education is that not only is it not effective at either delaying or stopping young people from having sexual intercourse but by pairing it with abstinence—by making abstinence only approach, people receiving that form of information get less information about pregnancy, STDs and HIV‘s and it makes them more susceptible to those things.\n\nHUBER:  Actually that‘s not -\n\nABRAMS:  Valerie, go ahead.\n\nMADDOW:  I didn‘t argue that it didn‘t work; I will argue is that it‘s harmful.\n\nHUBER:  Actually, that‘s not true at all.  Abstinence education is a holistic method that provides information on relationship building and accurate information on STDs and yes, accurate information on contraception all within the discussion of why abstinence is the best choice.\n\nABRAMS:  Wait.  Let‘s be honest.  What you mean by talking about what they‘re teaching about the use of condoms, et cetera, is that they don‘t work?  Right?  Abstinence-only only talks about the failure rate of condoms?\n\nHUBER:  Abstinence education provides a realistic and accurate discussion of contraception all within the context of why abstinence is the best choice.  Teens are presented all the information necessary to make wise decisions.\n\nABRAMS:  What do you do about the fact that 58 percent - let‘s put up this number set here 34 percent of U.S. teens have premarital sex by the age of 20, 58 percent of teens have had  sex before the age of 18, 14 percent of teens report of having sex with four or more people.  How do you deal - I mean, your argument would be you want to reduce the number from 58 percent before the age of 18.  But now, let‘s deal with the reality.  And that is that 58 percent of them are having sex before the age of 18.  I guess that the position of abstinence-only is to just go like this and say, oh, please tell me they‘re not going to do it, I hope they‘re not going to do it?\n\nHUBER:  No, the reality is that teens are resonating with the message of abstinence education in increasing numbers.  There‘s trend data to show more and more teens are abstaining.\n\nABRAMS:  That‘s not what the study show.  You‘re losing on the studies, you are.\n\nHUBER:  No, that‘s not true.  In fact, a recent study just released\n\nshowed -\n\nABRAMS:  From who?  Before you tell me what the study is, who did the study?\n\nHUBER:  Virginia‘s abstinence education program, state of Virginia\n\nABRAMS:  Right.\n\nHUBER:  And actually showed that teens engaged in an abstinence\n\neducation program were half as likely to -\n\nABRAMS:  Virginia, one of the states that‘s refused federal funding if I was correct.\n\nMADDOW:  Whenever I evaluate myself, I turn out to be doing awesome as well.  So that‘s—I think it‘s important—there was a congressionally mandated study that looked at abstinence-only programs over 10 years on the national level and it was the result of that study that told us that abstinence-only does not work to delay or stop teens from having sex before they get married.  They just don‘t work.  And so, if abstinence doesn‘t work, it‘s a waste of money.  If abstinence programs are being used to substitute for program that actually give people usable information about contraception and STDs and HIV and they are killing people.  They are not just expensive.\n\nABRAMS:  Valerie, you get the final word on this.\n\nHUBER:  Teens receive all the information necessary to make a good decision recording their sexual health.  And the misinformation regarding abstinence education that are other guest has been communicating is not at all consistent with what is taught in abstinence education programs.\n\nABRAMS:  All right.  I will say this -- $200 million, whatever you think of this ladies and gentlemen is at the very least controversy, $200 million for a program that is the very least controversial doesn‘t seem to me to be a very good use of taxpayer dollars.\n\nHUBER:  Actually -\n\nABRAMS:  But, Valerie Huber, Rachel Maddow, thanks a lot for joining.\n\nHUBER:  Thank you.\n\nABRAMS:  Coming up: Breaking news in the Stacy Peterson case tonight.\n\nPolice now searching the home that she shared with suspect husband, Drew.\n\nIt‘s happening as we speak.\n\nAnd Bill O‘Reilly complaining at the corrupt media drove the Don Imus story.  I guess you forgot that someone on his own network takes credit for exposing the I man.  That revelation coming up next in Beat the Press.\n\nABRAMS:  It‘s time for tonight‘s Beat the Press.  Our daily look back at the absurd and sometimes amusing perils of live TV.\n\nFirst up: Last night, Bill O‘Reilly was complaining about who drove the Don Imus story back in April.\n\nBILL O‘REILLY, TV HOST:  The corrupt media, and that‘s what drove this\n\nis the Internet smear site that drove this whole thing, it wasn‘t you, it\n\nwasn‘t any honest broker of information -\n\nABRAMS:  This is one of those times Bill O‘Reilly is absolutely right.  At least one person in the corrupt media did drive it, FOX host, John Gibson said, bragged on April 10th quote - “A FOX radio program, mine, pointed out what the morning host said last Wednesday.”  So according to John Gibson, he was the first or at least one of the first to point out what Imus said.  O‘Reilly‘s right, it did not come from an honest broker of information.\n\nNext up: Since the end of October, we‘ve known Drew Peterson wife Stacy is missing and his third wife is dead.  Sometimes, there‘s an ambiguity on how to define breaking news and then sometimes, there‘s not.  This is what “CNN Headline News” considered, quote, “Breaking” in that case last night.  One dead, one missing.  Six-week-old breaking news from CNN.  Finally the folks over at “60 Minutes” probably think they‘re all household names.  But Steve Kroft learned the hard way from Will Smith‘s childhood teacher that in truth, to most people, all those 60 Minutes folks are interchangeable, Steve, Morley, Safer, whoever.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You‘re on “60 minutes”.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  You‘re Morley.\n\nSTEVE KROFT:  No, I‘m Steve.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Steve.\n\nABRAMS:  Yes, I thought she almost said Maury if she says Maury Povich, I don‘t know.  Unless, I didn‘t (INAUDIBLE).\n\nWe need your help Beating the Press.  If you see anything right or wrong, amusing, absurd, go to our Web site Abrams.msnbc.com.  Leave us a tip in the box.  Please include the show and the time you saw the item.\n\nUp next: Breaking news in the Stacy Peterson case.  At this time, police are now searching the property that she shared with husband, Drew who is now a suspect in her disappearance.  There are cadaver-sniffing dogs at the scene.\n\nAnd later, Debra la Faye, the infamous teacher who slept with a 14-year-old, busted again.\n\nABRAMS:  Coming up, former Florida teacher and convicted sex offender Debra Lafave busted again.  And Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia caught off guard commenting on, of all things, whether O.J. Simpson killed his wife.  And a new study shows that chimps have better memories than humans in tonight‘s “Winners and Losers.”\n\nThe breaking news tonight, police executing a search warrant this evening on Drew Peterson‘s property.  Now, Peterson was at the home while police executed the search.  They used cadaver-sniffing dogs.\n\nJoining me on the phone right now as this is happening is Drew Peterson‘s attorney, Joel Brodsky.  Joel, thank you for joining us.  I appreciate it.  All right.  So, we‘re reading from reports that they executed a search warrant on his home.  Are you saying it was not on his home?\n\nJOEL BRODSKY, DREW PETERSON‘S ATTORNEY (on the phone):  No, I have a copy of the search warrant right here in my hand.  They delivered a warrant to him at his home about - the search warrant was only in regards to the cars, the dark blue GMC Denali and the 2002 purple Pontiac Grand Prix.  It has nothing to do with his home.\n\nABRAMS:  This report says they seized two cars, computers, eight handguns, three long guns and ammunition, true?\n\nBRODSKY:  That was done in the warrant that was served back when the house - the first warrant for the house which is back November 6th of ‘07.\n\nABRAMS:  But the two cars is something that was new?\n\nBRODSKY:  No.  The two cars were originally taken by a warrant that was issued maybe about a week after the November 6th warrant.  And now, this is the fourth warrant that was just given to us today, which is fairly extreme as far as the number of warrants go that I‘ve ever seen.\n\nABRAMS:  All right, Joel.  If you could stand by for a minute -\n\nBRODSKY:  Sure.\n\nABRAMS:  Let me bring in my panel.  We‘ve got Gina Mendola Longarzo, Larry Kobilinsky and Pam Bondi.  All right.  Pam, you‘re the prosecutor on this panel.  You heard Joel saying that this is a very unusual, the amount of the search warrants now being executed.  They‘ve now gone back to his home tonight to execute a search warrant with regard to his car.  Unusual?\n\nPAM BONDI, PROSECUTOR:  No, Dan, not if they keep receiving new information and they‘re being sure that it‘s done properly by going back to a judge, keeping the information fresh, the search warrant fresh.  So, no, not at all.  And it‘s a great sign for prosecutors in that they must feel that they have more evidence and that it must be linked to him.\n\nABRAMS:  Larry, what do you think they‘re looking for?\n\nLARRY KOBILINSKY, FORENSIC SCIENTIST:  Well, they may have no evidence from the home.  They may be looking for the possibility that she was transported in the vehicle.  Obviously, just finding her DNA there is not enough, her hair, her fibers.  They‘re looking for any indication that there was violence that took place.\n\nABRAMS:  All right.  Gina, hang on for one second.  We‘ve got NBC‘s Alison Kartevold on the phone who was just there at the home.  Allison, I understand you actually got to speak to Drew Peterson.  What did he say?\n\nALISON KARTEVOLD, NBC REPORTER:  Well, I went up to Drew‘s door and knocked on it.  By the time I got here, there were no official vehicles or anything happening.  And I asked him whether or not a search warrant had been executed on his home this evening and he said, no.  He said that they had not executed a search warrant tonight.\n\nAnd I said, what was it that they brought to you, the paper that they brought?  And he - I asked if it was a subpoena for someone in the house.  And he said, no, he said, “That was just paperwork for my attorney.  No big deal.”\n\nABRAMS:  And then he closed the door and said good-bye?\n\nKARTEVOLD:  Yes.\n\nBRODSKY:  Dan, I have to disagree with your panelist that this is a good sign.  To me, this is the second warrant for the car.  And - the cars.  And if they had found something on the third warrant, they wouldn‘t need a fourth warrant.  To me, this shows that they‘re continuing to execute search warrants and they‘re not finding anything.\n\nABRAMS:  But Gina, that is fairly standard procedure in cases where they follow up with search warrants or second warrants.  Sometimes, they didn‘t get everything they needed et cetera.\n\nGINA MENDOLA LONGARZO, DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  Yes, exactly.  They have to follow up on all leads.  I tend to agree with Mr. Brodsky because so far, it doesn‘t look like they have much of anything.  They‘re looking for a smoke gun.  They‘re looking for a clue here because they don‘t have a body and they need something.\n\nABRAMS:  Let me direct this to Mr. Brodsky.  How would you know whether they don‘t have anything?\n\nBRODSKY:  Well, as I said, this is the second search warrant for the same property, for the cars.  The language - you know, the boilerplate language in these warrants is relatively same, looking for trace evidence, fibers, et cetera, et cetera.  So, if they were able to find it in the third warrant - they didn‘t find it in the third warrant.\n\nThey‘ve issued the fourth warrant, I believe, because I filed a motion to get the cars back.  And this is their response.  This is their attempt to justify keeping the cars longer in an attempt to hope that they can develop something because they have nothing up to date.\n\nABRAMS:  Pam, what do you make of that?\n\nBONDI:  You know, Dan, it‘s what you just said.  We just don‘t know yet.  And what‘s happening is they want to do a very, very thorough search.  He did file a motion to get the cars back so that was good defense work on his part.  But, again, they may now be taking that car completely apart.  We‘ve had cases where you can find a drop of blood way underneath the carpet in the car.  So maybe that is what they‘re doing.  It‘s simply more thorough.\n\nABRAMS:  And Larry, that‘s what they have to be.  They have to find something incriminating because she lived with him.  So finding her DNA in the car in and of itself is not anything.\n\nKOBILINSKY:  Her mere presence in the car is meaningless.  They need to find some evidence of some force, some aggressive activity.  For example, if they find a clump of hair that was pulled, the evidence would be - the hair has roots, that would be an indication that something violent took place.  Obviously, blood is another indication.  It would have to be in a large enough amount. But that‘s what they‘re looking for in lots of nooks and crannies in the car.\n\nABRAMS:  Gina, look - Mr. Brodsky can answer this because he is the attorney, and now I‘m asking you in sort of - the macro picture.  If you were his attorney, you‘d be worried, wouldn‘t you?  You‘ve got the third wife problem.  You‘ve got the fourth wife problem.  You‘ve got another search warrant being executed tonight.\n\nLONGARZO:  Yes, I would be worried.  But also - they don‘t have a body here and we still don‘t know what their defense is.  The best advice I would say, at this point, for the defense is to say nothing.  Don‘t give any statements.  The Fifth Amendment right is sacred, it‘s crucial and it has to be preserved.\n\nABRAMS:  That brings me to an interesting question.  Joel, I want to ask you about this.  You wrote a note to Fox News, an angry note, about an appearance you made on Fox News.  And one of the things that you said is with regard to the timeline and whether you would talk about exactly what he was doing that night.\n\nYou said, “The only way I will even consider addressing this issue is if the Illinois State Police release their report of the interview Mr.  Peterson gave them shortly after Stacy‘s disappearance.  Mr. Peterson will not repeat himself.”\n\nLook, I understand as a lawyer your position is going to be echoing what Gina just said, which is you want to minimize the number of statements that you have publicly about what he did.  But I think that many in the public are going to say, “Look, if he‘s innocent and his wife is missing, why wouldn‘t he say, I was here and then I went here.  And this might help us find my missing wife?”\n\nBRODSKY:  Well, I don‘t know.  You know, Drew has always said that beating the bushes or looking in ponds is not going to find his missing wife because she‘s run away.  But that being said, he sat down and gave the Illinois State Police a full and complete accounting and a full and complete statement of what occurred during the relevant period of time.  The human language is an imperfect tool and to start repeating yourself is nothing but incriminating.  And he‘s not going to do it.\n\nABRAMS:  Can you tell us what it is he said to the Illinois State Police about his whereabouts?\n\nBRODSKY:  No.  I mean, I haven‘t read the reports.  He gave them a very full - it was a very long interview.  It was a very complete interview, a very thorough interview.  And I don‘t know all the details.  I‘d like to get a copy of that report but they‘re not going to release it to me until and unless there‘s a charge.\n\nABRAMS:  So your concern would be, let‘s be honest here, your concern would be in saying what he was doing that night, you might say something that might be slightly inconsistent with what he said, intentionally or unintentionally?\n\nBRODSKY:  Yes.  Well, it wouldn‘t be intentionally.  It would be unintentionally.  And it would also be because what we‘re dealing with is human language and human memory and human recollection which is very imperfect.  You say it once.  You lay it out.  You cooperate.  You make your statement.  You tell your story and that‘s it.  You‘ve told it and you‘re not going to repeat yourself.  And that‘s the way it is.\n\nABRAMS:  You know, Pam, I hear Joel is a lawyer.  I see Gina here nodding.  As a lawyer, I get that.  I get why lawyers would be giving this legal advice.  I hear them both.  But I think that a lot of people are still going to say, “That‘s the lawyer speaking.”\n\nWhat about the grieving husband speaking who‘s going to go out and say again and again, “Here‘s where I was, I want my lovely Stacy back.”  Now, I guess the argument would be that, well, if she supposedly said to him, “I left with some other guy,” that he just wanted to kind of go away?  Pam?\n\nBONDI:  Exactly, Dan.  And, you know, fundamentally, what do we want to know?  We want to know the truth.  That‘s all they‘re seeking is the truth.  And the problem with his statement is he‘s being very selective.\n\nAnd I agree with Gina, the right to remain silent, that‘s one of our most precious protected rights.  However, he‘s coming out giving all these interviews selectively.  He‘s saying what he wants to say and then he comes back and says, “Well, I don‘t want to say this.”  So I think he does.  I think he should come out and say where he was and what time.\n\nABRAMS:  I mean, Joel, he‘s got enough time to go on the air and bash his ex-wives.  And you can go on and you can be very critical of all the witnesses who seem to be becoming forward with potentially incriminating evidence against your client.  And yet, neither he nor you can go on and offer something as basic as a timeline as to what he was doing that night.\n\nBRODSKY:  Well, like I said, he gave a timeline.  He gave it to the authorities which are the relevant parties.  But when you‘re talking about Drew wanting the search - I always find it a little bit disingenuous.  Because the authorities have decided in their own minds that she‘s in a pond or a pool or in a field somewhere.  And that‘s where they‘re limiting their search.  If they were trying to be open-minded, they would also be searching as a missing person, seeing if she‘s in Saskatchewan, or up in Alaska, or down in Cancun, hiding out somewhere.  But right now their focus is - they‘re convinced.  They‘ve already decided that there‘s been a criminal act.  And I think that that‘s the problem.\n\nABRAMS:  But, Mr. Brodsky, they can give up on the search for the third wife, right?  She‘s dead.\n\nBRODSKY:  Correct.\n\nABRAMS:  OK.\n\nBRODSKY:  What I mean -\n\nABRAMS:  Yes.  I know.\n\nBRODSKY:  But they - all right.\n\nABRAMS:  Joel Brodsky, Alison Kartevold, and thank you to everyone on the panel.  I appreciate it.\n\nUp next, former teacher Debra Lafave admitted to having sex with a 14-year-old student.  She was busted again today.\n\nAnd later, are you smarter than a monkey?  A new report actually says chimps have better memories than humans.  They did a test.  It‘s unbelievable, in “Winners and Losers” tonight.\n\nABRAMS:  Did you know almost 10 percent of U.S. public school students have received unwanted sexual attention from school employees?  Coming up, Debra Lafave, the teacher infamous for having sex with a 14-year-old is busted again.\n\nABRAMS:  Tonight, former teacher Debra Lafave has been busted again.  In 2004, the then 23-year-old Lafave drew national attention after she admitted having sex with her 14-year-old student.  She pled guilty to lewd and lascivious behavior, sentenced to three years house arrest and seven years probation.\n\nWell, today she was busted for violating that probation.  The violation report says she had numerous nonwork-related conversations with a 17-year-old girl she worked with.  In a minute we‘ll talk about whether she should have been arrested.  But first, Lafave, long ago, admitted that what she did was wrong.\n\nDEBRA LAFAVE, CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER:  I came on this show to tell my side of the story.  And all I‘m being is truthful.  I‘m going to be the first person to say, yes, it‘s my fault and I‘m dealing with that.  He consented but I should have been the one to say, “Look, you are a kid and this is not a good idea whether you want it or not.”\n\nMATT LAUER, HOST, THE “TODAY” SHOW:  You should have said it on a number of occasions.\n\nLAFAVE:  Oh, yes.\n\nLAUER:  You should have said it when you first started flirting with him.  And you clearly should have said it before you had sex with this young man.\n\nLAFAVE:  Clearly.  I committed a sex offense, but I‘m not a sex offender, even though I‘m labeled as that.  I made a really, really, really bad choice.\n\nLAUER:  You don‘t see yourself as a predator.\n\nLAFAVE:  It‘s hard.  It is so hard because I lived 23 years of my life, you know, knowing who I was.  I was a kind-hearted person who loved children, who would never do anything to break the law.  I was a good person.  And then now everything has just changed.  So it‘s just really hard for me to accept that.  I think I should be in jail.\n\nLAUER:  You think you should be?\n\nLAFAVE:  Yes, by the standards, what I did - that‘s the law.  I should have gotten jail time.\n\nABRAMS:  All right.  Well, now she may.  She violated a condition, what‘s known as 69 of her probation, meaning she had contact with a minor, a 17-year-old co-worker.  Joining us now is Chris Echegaray, a reporter with the “Tampa Tribune.”  Chris, thanks a lot.  I appreciate it.  What happened here?\n\nCHRIS ECHEGARAY, REPORTER, “TAMPA TRIBUNE”:  Thank you.  Well, according to the arrest report, Deb Lafave was speaking to an underage co-worker about family issues, boyfriend issues, sexual-related issues.  And that conversation violated the term of her probation.\n\nABRAMS:  Where was she working?\n\nECHEGARAY:  She was working at Danny Boy‘s as a waitress in Sun City Center for almost two years without incident, according to the manager, Scott Griffin, who I interviewed earlier today.\n\nABRAMS:  And they liked her?  They thought she was doing well?\n\nECHEGARAY:  Clean record, always punctual, very pleasant, good worker\n\nrave reviews from Scott Griffin.  He claims that this was a complete surprise.  He was unaware of what was going on.  He claims there was no lack of supervision when Lafave was there.  He claims the 17-year-old female co-worker did not complain about the conversations to him.  And despite it all, he claims that this is a big surprise.\n\nABRAMS:  Let me bring in Michelle Suskauer here.  All right, look, Michelle, technically I guess this is a violation of the probation.  She‘s not supposed to be in contact - this is a 17-year-old co-worker who she‘s talking to about life.\n\nMICHELLE SUSKAUER, DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  Who‘s going to be 18.  Right.\n\nShe‘s going to be 18 in January.\n\nABRAMS:  So she really needs to go - they really need to send her back.  I mean, look, whether you think they should have gotten jail time in the first place, separate question.  She didn‘t.  So now, are they actually going to try to put her away for talking to an almost 18-year-old at a restaurant?\n\nSUSKAUER:  Well, it‘s completely up to the judge.  And the standard, Dan, is a knowing and willful violation.  So did she know that this girl was 17 and was this a willful violation?  And it‘s really easy to prove a violation of probation in Florida.  It‘s to the conscience of the court.\n\nSo it depends on -\n\nABRAMS:  She‘s not allowed to talk about nonwork-related issues, right?\n\nSUSKAUER:  Right.\n\nABRAMS:  So that means when she‘s at work at the restaurant, if they talk about anything apart from forks, knives and napkins, she‘s in violation of her probation?\n\nSUSKAUER:  Well, you know, it looks like she may have taken it a little bit further than that.  If she‘s talking about - and sure, if they want to prove this, they‘re going to have to bring this girl in or someone who overheard this conversation.  What were they talking about?\n\nBoyfriends, sexual-related issues?  It really, look,- Dan, we‘ve -\n\nABRAMS:  I‘ve got to go, Michelle.  But look, I think it‘s time to end this.  Michelle Suskauer and Chris Echegaray.  Thanks a lot.  I appreciate it.\n\nSUSKAUER:  Thanks.\n\nABRAMS:  Up next in “Winners and Losers,” Spirit Airlines gets some heat over their MILF promotion.  Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia says that O.J. Simpson killed his wife.  And a 5-year-old chimp beats college students in short-term memory tests.\n\nAn airline that keeps a controversial ad; a smart judge who agrees O.J. did something bad; or a primate who proves he may be smarter than your dad.  Which will be tonight‘s big winner or loser?\n\nABRAMS:  It‘s time for tonight‘s “Winners and Losers” for this 4th day of December, 2007.  Our first winner, Spirit Airlines.  The discount flier getting extra ink over its new promotion called M.I.L.F. - many islands, low fares, offering up to $9 flights to the Caribbean.  Airline officials now swear they had no idea the term M.I.L.F.  could possibly have another meaning.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR:  M.I.L.F., mom I‘d like to (EXPLETIVE DELETED).\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.\n\nABRAMS:  Despite the ad‘s intriguing island alignment, the airline pleaded ignorance, saying the only thing obscene is their competitor‘s prices.\n\nOur first loser, the New York Archdiocese whose new coloring book deals with another kind of M.I.L.F. - minors interacting with lonely fathers.  One page features an angel telling an altar boy to avoid being alone in a room with adults.  The pedophile priest prevention coloring pamphlet passed out to 700 schools and religious groups across the State.\n\nOur second winner, Democratic presidential candidate Bill Richardson.\n\nThe White House hopeful just scored the endorsement of a former U.S.\n\nPresident.\n\nMARTIN SHEEN, AS PRESIDENT JOSIAH BARTLET:  In this building when the president stands, nobody sits.\n\nABRAMS:  All right, all right.  It‘s the endorsement of Martin Sheen who played one on TV, not reality.\n\nOur second loser, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, caught off-guard today endorsing the reality that O.J. Simpson killed his wife.  When discussing another case at the court, the Simpson case was mentioned, and Scalia said, “It‘s also a case in which a man killed his wife with a knife.”\n\nTOM CRUISE, ACTOR:  I want the truth.\n\nJACK NICHOLSON:  You can‘t handle the truth.\n\nABRAMS:  Nice to hear the usually guarded Supreme Court justice is offering up some straight talk.\n\nBut the big loser of the day, employees at a Papa John‘s pizza parlor in Florence, Alabama, who allegedly sprinkled a little something extra on top of a pie they delivered to a local church group.  Police say the pie was peppered with pot.  No word on whether any of the group are now suffering short-term memory loss.\n\nThe big winner of the day?  Chimps whose short-term memory may actually be better than humans.  Aiamu(ph) was one of those who dominated his human counterparts in this memory test.  The numbers one to nine flashed on the screen for a fraction of a second.  The chimps managed to remember the arrangement 80 percent of the time.  Their college-age competitors, only 40 percent.\n\nSo this may actually prove that in some ways the simians are smarter than the humans.  Here is now is ape research expert Steve Ross from Chicago‘s Lincoln Park Zoo.  Steve, thanks for joining us.  I appreciate it.  This is a little hard for many people to believe, that in some ways chimps may actually be smarter?\n\nSTEVE ROSS, APE RESEARCH EXPERT, LINCOLN PARK ZOO:  Well, it‘s a remarkable finding, really.  It challenges some of the long-time assumptions that humans hold cognitive abilities that are far superior than all other animals.\n\nABRAMS:  Is there any other explanation here?  I mean, how do you think the researchers could possibly explain how the chimps may in this particular way be, quote, “smarter”?\n\nROSS:  Well, I think it‘s long known that chimpanzees and some other species such as dolphins have highly advanced cognitive abilities.  These chimpanzees in particular have long-term training that they‘ve been working with.  And I think it‘s interesting to show and to challenge these types of assumptions about human intelligence and animal intelligence.\n\nABRAMS:  Look, here is someone who has obviously spent a lot of time with chimps, unlike most of us.  Were you surprised when you heard - they didn‘t just do as well or they didn‘t just do well on a memory test, but they actually did twice as well as humans?\n\nROSS:  Yes.  The youngest chimps did best of all.  They were able to complete the task much quicker than human subjects.  And although this is a little bit surprising, having seen these chimps in action and worked with chimps for a while, there is some element of expectation for the performance of these chimps and other chimps like them.\n\nABRAMS:  Really?  So this didn‘t come as a big surprise?\n\nROSS:  No.  We work with chimpanzees and gorillas at Lincoln Park Zoo on touch screen work.  And every day we see them perform things we wouldn‘t expect in the meantime.\n\nABRAMS:  Wow.  Unbelievable stuff.  Steve Ross from Chicago‘s Lincoln Park Zoo, thanks a lot.  I appreciate it.\n\nROSS:  Thanks Dan.\n\nABRAMS:  That‘s all the time we have for tonight.  Up next is “THE DOCK BLOCK.”  I will see you here tomorrow.\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

extrÃªmedroite qui a le vent en poupe et nous replonge dans les annÃ©es 1930 notre nation bien aimÃ©e sidentifierait plutÃ´t aux clochers Ã jeanne darc aux rois de france Ã napolÃ©on au colonialisme Ã la guerre de 14 pÃ©tain ou mÃªme de gaulle le roman national nest quune construction unilatÃ©rale et largement fictive destinÃ©e Ã faire croire Ã lexistence objective de quelque chose comme une nation ou un peuple voire une race union sacrÃ©e qui ne se produit pourtant quavec la guerre contre lennemi hÃ©rÃ©ditaire dans une sociÃ©tÃ© si divisÃ©e et une dÃ©mocratie pluraliste par le danger mÃªme quil reprÃ©sente il faut reconnaÃ®tre au populisme sa fonction de symptÃ´me dune situation bloquÃ©e dexpression dun besoin de protection mais surtout de colÃ¨re impuissante Ã se faire menaÃ§ant contre les Ã©lites et Ã jouer au con comme on peut y Ãªtre amenÃ© parfois pour mettre fin aux arguties de ladversaire ce nest dailleurs pas sans effets sur les maÃ®tres de la finance qui redoutent ce facteur dinstabilitÃ© politique mais pour linstant mÃªme la grÃ¨ce ny ayant pas cÃ©dÃ© malgrÃ© la saignÃ©e quon leur impose le pire nest pas le plus probable encore heureusement car Ã jouer au con il arrive quon le devienne vraiment mais la crise nen sera que plus longue sans doute en tout cas aprÃ¨s lÃ©poque dun nÃ©olibÃ©ralisme dÃ©bridÃ© davos sinquiÃ¨te dÃ©sormais des risques les plus probables causÃ©s par la disparitÃ© de revenus le chÃ´mage et le sousemploi le rÃ©chauffement climatique la multiplication des Ã©vÃ¨nements mÃ©tÃ©o extrÃªmes mais aussi les cyberattaques les risques les plus graves selon eux seraient plutÃ´t les crises budgÃ©taires le chÃ´mage et le sousemploi les changements climatiques la crise de leau leffondrement dinternet des chercheurs prÃ©tendent que des investissements purement alÃ©atoires pourraient calmer les fiÃ¨vres des marchÃ©s sauf que ce nest pas un phÃ©nomÃ¨ne physique qui produit bulles et krachs mais des processus plus profonds avantages Ã court terme croyances sociales cycles Ã long terme et que la cause du krach est la bulle prÃ©cÃ©dente qui est difficile Ã rÃ©guler puisque cela voudrait dire mettre un terme Ã des gains profitables Ã la plupart des acteurs mais une fois quon a dÃ©collÃ© il faut bien atterrir en tout cas les bouleversements sociaux de laccÃ©lÃ©ration technologique ne font que commencer pouvant affecter un domaine aussi vaste que les mÃ©tiers de la construction avec des imprimantes 3d capables maintenant dÃ©difier une maison en 24 heures paradoxalement il se pourrait que ce ne soit plus le secteur secondaire qui tire lÃ©conomie mais pour un temps au moins le secteur primaire avec le monde des cÃ©rÃ©ales devenu moteur de la croissance mondiale Ã©tant au cÅur de deux des principales rÃ©volutions technologiques qui sont en train de se mettre en place Ã lÃ©chelle de la planÃ¨te les nte nouvelles technologies de lenergie et les nta nouvelles technologies de lagroalimentaire il faudrait ajouter la reconversion agroÃ©cologique mais il y a aussi par exemple des capteurs dans la terre qui permettraient damÃ©liorer significativement les rendements avec des traitements plus appropriÃ©s arrosage etc mÃªme si ce nest pas vraiment nouveau un autre paradoxe cest quen allemagne la filiÃ¨re bio narrive plus Ã satisfaire la demande qui explose rÃ©sultat un tiers du bio consommÃ© est importÃ© sinon les allemands veulent favoriser le stockage domestique de lÃ©nergie solaire plutÃ´t que le stockage sur le rÃ©seau ou par de grandes infrastructures en france un rapport de la cour des comptes trÃ¨s contestÃ© critique les mesures en faveur des Ã©nergies renouvelables responsables de la crÃ©ation de bulles artificielles alors quil faudrait privilÃ©gier les Ã©conomies dÃ©nergie notamment dans lagriculture le modÃ¨le de consommation plus que le systÃ¨me de production tel est bien en dÃ©finitive ce quil conviendrait de modifier en fait les 2 sont nÃ©cessaires pour linstant la rÃ©alitÃ© cest quon na jamais produit autant de pÃ©trole mÃªme si cest difficilement crÃ©dible Ã si courte Ã©chÃ©ance il est remarquable quune Ã©tude de prospective pour 2020 prÃ©voit linvasion de toutes sortes de robots mais en contrepartie linstauration dun revenu minimum garanti pour tous on peut Ãªtre surpris aussi dapprendre que malgrÃ© ou Ã cause de ses progrÃ¨s dÃ©sormais la mÃ©decine constitue la 3Ã¨me

intÃ©ressants mÃªme les antioxydants seraient Ã proscrire a rebours des Ã©volutions actuelles l acadÃ©mie de mÃ©decine dÃ©rape en sopposant Ã lautorisation du sativex comme dans de nombreux autres pays confirmant quil y a vÃ©ritablement un problÃ¨me en france avec le cannabis alors que la lÃ©galisation du cannabis gagne du terrain partout et quon daigne enfin tirer partie des vertus de drogues comme lectasy contre lanxiÃ©tÃ© sciences jai retrouvÃ© un certain plaisir cette fois Ã faire cette revue mais cela prend bien trop de temps la recherche notamment mayant bien intÃ©ressÃ© ce qui est assez rare avec la puissance incroyable des mathÃ©matiques de la parcimonie les traces dune civilisation europÃ©enne il y a 5000 ans limagerie mÃ©dicale qui rend compte de la conscience comme inhibition des rÃ©actions primaires et se passe trÃ¨s bien des conceptions quantiques quen propose penrose par ailleurs pour la science nest pas en reste avec la dÃ©couverte de neurones correspondant Ã des concepts ainsi que la confirmation assez incroyable des bouleversements Ã©cologiques provoquÃ©s par nos ancÃªtres lorsquils sont devenus carnivores faisant remonter lanthropocÃ¨ne Ã plus d1 million dannÃ©es revenir aux donnÃ©es astronomiques du temps de copernic permet de comprendre Ã©galement les objections rationnelles qui pouvaient y Ãªtre fait Ã lÃ©poque et pas du tout seulement les prÃ©jugÃ©s religieux du cÃ´tÃ© des brÃ¨ves pour la physique le plus extraordinaire serait la possibilitÃ© de tÃ©lÃ©porter de lÃ©nergie Ã grandes distances mais il y a aussi hawking qui radicalise sa conception des trous noirs qui ne le sont plus toutÃ fait soumis aux fluctuations quantiques ce quon appelle lhypothÃ¨se gaÃ¯a se trouve Ã©tonnement renforcÃ©e par la dÃ©couverte incroyable que la vie pourrait favoriser volcanisme et tectonique des plaques qui euxmÃªmes la font Ã©voluer vers la complexitÃ© a lopposÃ© des hypothÃ¨ses de dÃ©part de james lovelock ce ne serait donc en rien une autorÃ©gulation puisque producteur de catastrophes plutÃ´t dynamique rÃ©sultant dune dÃ©stabilisation mutuelle mais on nimaginait pas une telle interaction entre le physique et le biologique une des grandes remises en cause du mois cest une rÃ©Ã©valuation complÃ¨te de la part du gÃ©nome hÃ©ritÃ© de neandertal qui nest plus du tout nÃ©gligeable et de lordre de 1 mais pourrait dÃ©passer les 20 rÃ©partis dans la population mÃªme si chacun nen a que trÃ¨s peu par ailleurs la viabilitÃ© de macaques gÃ©nÃ©tiquement modifiÃ©s avec une technique trÃ¨s prÃ©cise dÃ©dition des gÃ¨nes nommÃ©e crispr destinÃ©e Ã des animaux de laboratoire semble bien ouvrir la voie aux hommes gÃ©nÃ©tiquement modifiÃ©s et au transhumanisme tant redoutÃ© si des essais se font ils ne devraient pas Ãªtre divulguÃ©s avant des annÃ©es sans doute en attendant on peut sextasier davoir trouvÃ© dans linsula le circuit de lextase ou effet dostoÃ¯evski prÃ©cÃ©dent certaines crises Ã©pileptiques qui pourrait participer aux expÃ©riences mystiques compromission incontestable du corps avec la religion que dire du bienfait de pouvoir effacer une mÃ©moire rÃ©cente avec un inhibiteur de hdac2 plus facile que deffacer ses traces sur internet lusage devrait en rester confidentiel mais qui sait par contre ce qui nous fait entrer Ã coup sÃ»r dans une Ã¨re nouvelle cest le sÃ©quenÃ§age du gÃ©nome Ã 1000 et lanalyse gÃ©nÃ©tique gÃ¨ne Ã gÃ¨ne accÃ©lÃ©rÃ©e mais aussi la nanomÃ©decine si lon en croit toutes les recherches en cours les nanoparticules sont vraiment lavenir de la mÃ©decine version scientifique de lhomÃ©opathie agissant Ã doses infimes sur des cellules ou des processus prÃ©cisÃ©ment ciblÃ©s parfois cependant un simple remÃ¨de comme laspirine suffirait Ã rÃ©duire les macromutations responsables des mÃ©tastases cancÃ©reuses numÃ©rique selon une Ã©tude contestable le dÃ©clin de facebook pourrait Ãªtre comme celui de myspace comparable Ã une fin dÃ©pidÃ©mie ce dont facebook se moque rÃ©futant avec force graphiques le lien fait ici entre les recherches sur facebook et son niveau dactivitÃ© effective nimaginant pas un instant quil soit possible de perdre 950 millions dutilisateurs en quelques annÃ©es seulement il faut effectivement prendre en compte les masses en jeu qui augmentent considÃ©rablement linertie dun systÃ¨me mais il peut y avoir tout de mÃªme des mouvements de masse et on peut craindre que plus vite une nouvelle technologie dÃ©colle plus vite elle disparaÃ®t sauf si on innove sans cesse comme google mais peutÃªtre pas assez facebook en tout cas cest dans le domaine du numÃ©rique que les pays riches devraient perdre en premier leur suprÃ©matie les internautes des pays les plus peuplÃ©s Ã©tant dÃ©jÃ majoritaires y compris dans les rÃ©seaux sociaux on nest quau dÃ©but dune vÃ©ritable tectonique des plaques qui va changer les rapports de force comme les modes de vie parmi les innovations les plus Ã©tranges du mois et bien que cela ne soit peutÃªtre jamais mis en oeuvre il faut signaler lÃ©tonnant brevet dÃ©posÃ© par amazon qui compterait se baser sur les commandes prÃ©cÃ©dentes vos recherches listes de souhaits et le temps passÃ© sur le site afin de dÃ©terminer ce quils doivent prÃ©envoyer vers chez vous sinon l holographie devrait finir par simposer dans les annÃ©es qui viennent maintenant quelle atteint les performances des vidÃ©os plus

qui pourrait Ãªtre utile cette fois et justifier leur achat pour autre chose que pour jouer les google glass surveillent lendormissement au volant estce que cela suffira Ã faire un succÃ¨s pour autant de ce qui reste de lordre du gadget pour linstant la domotique non plus ne dÃ©colle toujours pas malgrÃ© les efforts de compatibilitÃ© qui sont faits en tout cas google sy investit et on pourrait bientÃ´t accÃ©der Ã sa chambre dhÃ´tel avec son smartphone un vÃ©ritable problÃ¨me cest que linternet des choses est trop vulnÃ©rable alors mÃªme que ce secteur explose en ce moment enfin on pourrait gÃ©rer le trafic ferroviaire de lespace et un algorithme promet de minimiser les Ã©missions de co2 de 20 ou la consommation Ã©lectrique de 60 du cloud dont la montÃ©e en puissance est effectivement assez prÃ©occupante nÃ©cessitant Ã lÃ©vidence une meilleure efficacitÃ© Ã©nergÃ©tique pour la science no 436 limpression 3d le cÅur artificiel nest pas une prioritÃ© mÃ©dicale p12 limplantation dun nouveau cÅur artificiel en dÃ©cembre dernier est une prouesse technique et mÃ©dicale elle ne doit cependant pas occulter la nÃ©cessitÃ© dÃ©valuer les besoins rÃ©els pourquoi ils nont pas cru copernic p74 il est trÃ¨s intÃ©ressant de ne pas projeter aprÃ¨s coup la connaissance que nous en avons et de voir que les arguments des opposants Ã©taient toutÃ fait raisonnables et convaincants quand en 1543 nicolas copernic affirma que la terre tourne autour du soleil lopposition ne vint pas seulement des autoritÃ©s religieuses les observations privilÃ©giaient une autre cosmographie le premier argument de riccioli est fondÃ© sur lincapacitÃ© Ã dÃ©tecter les effets quune planÃ¨te tournant sur ellemÃªme devrait exercer sur les projectiles et les corps en chute libre tycho brahe a Ã©tÃ© impressionnÃ© par lÃ©lÃ©gance du systÃ¨me copernicien mais certains aspects le gÃªnent notamment il manque au modÃ¨le de copernic une explication physique du mouvement de la terre lexplication ne viendra quun bon siÃ¨cle plus tard avec la physique newtonienne dun diamÃ¨tre estimÃ© Ã plusieurs milliers de kilomÃ¨tres cette boule de roches et de terre doit avoir une masse Ã©norme questce qui pourrait faire tourner un tel corps autour du soleil alors quil est dÃ©jÃ difficile de tirer un chariot chargÃ© copernic sait bien quon ne dÃ©tecte mÃªme pas de parallaxe annuelle cestÃ dire un changement des positions relatives apparentes des Ã©toiles dÃ» au dÃ©placement de la terre sur son orbite or si la terre tourne autour du soleil labsence de parallaxe annuelle implique que le diamÃ¨tre de son orbite est luimÃªme insignifiant Â« comme un point Â» comparÃ© aux distances stellaires la taille de lunivers devient alors un nouvel Â« incommensurablement grand Â» dÃ©chelle difficile Ã concevoir brahe propose son propre systÃ¨me le soleil la lune et les Ã©toiles tournent autour dune terre immobile comme dans le systÃ¨me ptolÃ©mÃ©en tandis que les planÃ¨tes tournent autour du soleil comme dans le systÃ¨me copernicien si le systÃ¨me copernicien a tardÃ© Ã Ãªtre acceptÃ© cest donc Ã cause du manque de preuves scientifiques solides confirmant les ordres de grandeur stellaires et cosmiques quil implique personne nenregistra de faÃ§on convaincante la parallaxe stellaire annuelle avant friedrich bessel en 1838 comment le cerveau code les concepts p46 cela fait partie des nouvelles les plus surprenantes et pas encore assez Ã©tayÃ©es quun neurone puisse Ãªtre liÃ© spÃ©cifiquement Ã une personne ou un objet non pas sa forme ou ses transformation mais son concept sa permanence sa dÃ©signation son Ãªtre peuton dire mais justement il nest pas si clair de savoir de quoi on parle exactement il faudrait faire la part entre la fonction du langage oÃ¹ le concept procÃ¨de par division omnis determinatio est negatio et la rÃ©duction Ã un trait particulier saillance ou Ã un noeud dassociations dun ensemble de caractÃ¨res ou bien plutÃ´t un processus conceptuel de gÃ©nÃ©ralisation dabstraction des dÃ©tails particuliers lidÃ©e dune personne ou dun objet connu serait codÃ©e par un petit ensemble de neurones qui sactiveraient spÃ©cifiquement en 1969 jerry lettvin 19202011 faisait lhypothÃ¨se provocatrice selon laquelle environ 18 000 neurones seulement pourraient coder lensemble des expÃ©riences conscientes souvenirs et pensÃ©es liÃ©es Ã une personne ou un objet dÃ©signÃ©e ironiquement par lexpression Â« thÃ©orie du neurone grandmÃ¨re Â» cette affirmation suscite de nombreux dÃ©bats depuis plus de 40 ans il y a quelques annÃ©es avec gabriel kreiman de la facultÃ© de mÃ©decine de harvard aux Ã©tatsunis et leila reddy du centre de recherche sur le cerveau et la cognition Ã toulouse nous avons dÃ©couvert chez un patient un neurone qui rÃ©agissait fortement aux photographies de la comÃ©dienne jennifer aniston mais pas Ã celles de dizaines dautres acteurs cÃ©lÃ©britÃ©s lieux ou animaux ce neurone Ã©tait situÃ© dans lhippocampe une rÃ©gion du cerveau importante pour la mÃ©moire chez un autre sujet un neurone de lhippocampe sactivait Ã la vue dune photographie ou du nom de lactrice halle berry et ne rÃ©agissait Ã rien dautre un autre neurone rÃ©agissait sÃ©lectivement Ã des images de luke skywalker le hÃ©ros du film la guerre des Ã©toiles et Ã son nom Ã©crit sur un Ã©cran ou prononcÃ© par une voix de synthÃ¨se le mÃªme phÃ©nomÃ¨ne Ã©tait observÃ© pour dautres cÃ©lÃ©britÃ©s pour obtenir ces rÃ©sultats nous avons dÃ» enregistrer lactivitÃ© de neurones un par un les neurones associÃ©s aux personnalitÃ©s sontils ceux de la thÃ©orie controversÃ©e du neurone grandmÃ¨re selon une version extrÃªme de cette hypothÃ¨se un seul neurone rÃ©pondrait Ã un concept particulier cependant le fait que nous ayons trouvÃ© un neurone rÃ©agissant Ã lidÃ©e de jennifer aniston suggÃ¨re quil y en a plusieurs en effet sil Ã©tait unique la chance de le dÃ©couvrir parmi des milliards dautres serait infime en outre une maladie ou un accident qui dÃ©truirait ce seul neurone supprimerait toute trace du concept ce qui semble trÃ¨s improbable une version moins extrÃªme de lhypothÃ¨se postule quÃ chaque concept correspond un petit ensemble de neurones on connaÃ®t cependant de nombreux neurones qui rÃ©agissent Ã plus dun concept ainsi aprÃ¨s avoir dÃ©couvert le neurone de jennifer aniston nous avons rÃ©pÃ©tÃ© lexpÃ©rience en utilisant de nombreuses images liÃ©es Ã lactrice nous avons montrÃ© que ce neurone sactive aussi pour lisa kudrow une autre vedette de la sÃ©rie tÃ©lÃ©visÃ©e friends qui a rendu cÃ©lÃ¨bres les deux comÃ©diennes de mÃªme le neurone de luke skywalker rÃ©agit Ã©galement Ã yoda un autre jedi du film la guerre des Ã©toiles un mÃªme neurone sactive pour deux joueurs de basketball diffÃ©rents un autre neurone rÃ©agit Ã plusieurs chercheurs qui soccupent du patient dont on enregistre lactivitÃ© cÃ©rÃ©brale etc ces neurones pourraient tout de mÃªme Ãªtre considÃ©rÃ©s comme des neurones grandmÃ¨re mais qui rÃ©agiraient Ã des concepts plus Ã©tendus tels que les deux femmes blondes de friends les jedis de la guerre des Ã©toiles les joueurs de basketball ou les scientifiques rÃ©alisant des expÃ©riences avec le patient de fait un neurone sactive de faÃ§on similaire en rÃ©ponse Ã diffÃ©rentes images de la mÃªme personne ainsi quÃ son nom Ã©crit ou prononcÃ© ainsi il semble bien rÃ©agir au concept cestÃ dire Ã toutes les reprÃ©sentations de la chose ellemÃªme il serait donc plus appropriÃ© de parler de Â« neurone de concept Â» plutÃ´t que de neurone grandmÃ¨re de tels neurones pourraient Ãªtre activÃ©s par plusieurs concepts Ã condition que ces derniers soient liÃ©s plus le concept est abstrait â cestÃ dire indÃ©pendant dune reprÃ©sentation particuliÃ¨re â moins le neurone a besoin dinformation pour le coder selon nous les neurones de concepts situÃ©s dans ces aires cÃ©rÃ©brales sont indispensables Ã la traduction dÃ©lÃ©ments conscients â issus dentrÃ©es sensorielles ou stockÃ©s puis remÃ©morÃ©s â en souvenirs Ã long terme ces derniers seront ensuite enregistrÃ©s dans diverses aires corticales quand deux concepts sont liÃ©s certains des neurones qui codent lun tendent aussi Ã sactiver pour lautre lÃ encore le codage sÃ©parÃ© des concepts par des rÃ©seaux restreints et distincts est un avantage en effet les simulations montrent quun tel codage est nÃ©cessaire Ã la crÃ©ation rapide dassociations les neurones de concepts pourraient constituer lun des principaux fondements physiologiques des capacitÃ©s cognitives humaines ils relient la perception Ã la mÃ©moire et donnent une reprÃ©sentation abstraite dune connaissance sÃ©mantique â les personnes les lieux les objets et tous les concepts qui sont importants pour nous ils constituent les Ã©lÃ©ments de construction de nos souvenirs personnels ils permettent dignorer les innombrables dÃ©tails sans importance et de dÃ©gager un sens qui sert Ã fabriquer de nouvelles associations et de nouveaux souvenirs ainsi ils encodent lessentiel de ce quil y a Ã retenir de nos expÃ©riences ce dernier paragraphe identifie un peu trop lexpÃ©rience Ã notre spÃ©cificitÃ© humaine car au moins certains animaux doivent possÃ©der ces capacitÃ©s conceptuelles quil ne faut pas confondre avec les capacitÃ©s langagiÃ¨res lhomme devenu carnivore les grands carnivores disparaissent p62 cest la confirmation que lhomme est bien le vrai roi des animaux se situant au sommet de la pyramide alimentaire bien quon reste incrÃ©dule devant une empreinte Ã©cologique si dÃ©vastatrice Ã une Ã©poque oÃ¹ nous Ã©tions si peu nombreux mais on peut admettre que le superprÃ©dateur que nous devenions ait un impact plus fort que la rÃ©introduction du loup il est un fait que les grands animaux nont pas survÃ©cus longtemps Ã la prÃ©sence dhommes sur leur territoire que ce soit en europe en amÃ©rique en australie sauf les Ã©lÃ©phants mais les grands prÃ©dateurs ont bien disparus dafrique aussi lutilisation du feu a sans doute accÃ©lÃ©rÃ© le passage Ã une nourriture carnivore et devrait dÃ¨s lors remonter Ã 15 millions dannÃ©es au moins ce qui est loin dÃªtre solidement prouvÃ© encore voir plus bas le dÃ©clin des anciens grands prÃ©dateurs coÃ¯ncide Ã peu prÃ¨s avec le passage des hominidÃ©s Ã un rÃ©gime alimentaire plus riche en viande cette concordance temporelle suggÃ¨re quil y a quelque deux millions dannÃ©es cestÃ dire bien avant lapparition de homo sapiens les premiers humains ont dÃ©clenchÃ© le dÃ©clin des grands prÃ©dateurs africains dans ce cas nos ancÃªtres auraient commencÃ© Ã transformer radicalement les Ã©cosystÃ¨mes bien plus tÃ´t quon ne le pensait Ã une Ã©poque oÃ¹ leur population Ã©tait assez restreinte le genre homo sembletil a Ã©tÃ© une force de la nature depuis ses dÃ©buts les taux dextinction augmentent tandis que les taux dapparition de nouvelles espÃ¨ces restent bas de sorte que le nombre despÃ¨ces de grands carnivores chute particuliÃ¨rement vers 15 million dannÃ©es outre les divers types despÃ¨ces qui sÃ©teignent des groupes entiers disparaissent tel celui des fÃ©lins Ã dents de sabre Ã mesure de ces disparitions la proportion de formes modernes plus petites â lions lÃ©opards chacals etc â au sein des carnivores augmente il y a environ 300 000 ans les carnivores archaÃ¯ques ont tous Ã©tÃ© balayÃ©s en afrique de lest alors que la population des carnivores actuels se mettait en place les grands carnivores actuels de lafrique de lest occupent moins de 15 pour cent de lespace morphologique des carnivores ayant vÃ©cu Ã lÃ©poque du pic de biodiversitÃ© des carnivora il y a 3 Ã 35 millions dannÃ©es la richesse fonctionnelle des carnivora en afrique cestÃ dire la diversitÃ© des aliments consommÃ©s et des niches Ã©cologiques occupÃ©es par les carnivores africains a Ã©tÃ© rÃ©duite de presque 99 pour cent de sa valeur entre lÃ©poque de lucy et aujourdhui lanthropologue henry bunn conÃ§oit cette transition vers une alimentation plus carnivore en trois Ã©tapes tout dabord les homininÃ©s auraient occasionnellement exploitÃ© les carcasses abandonnÃ©es Ã laide dÃ©clats naturels ou des premiers outils lithiques ils auraient ensuite acquis la capacitÃ© de dÃ©pecer de briser les os pour accÃ©der Ã la moelle ainsi que celle de ramener au camp des quartiers de viande enfin les homininÃ©s sont devenus des Ã©quarrisseurs experts qui disposaient manifestement de carcasses entiÃ¨res dans leurs foyers en sappuyant sur les preuves archÃ©ologiques disponibles h bunn situe la premiÃ¨re Ã©tape entre 25 et 26 millions dannÃ©es habituÃ©s Ã se nourrir de charognes les homininÃ©s navaient alors quune faible capacitÃ© Ã se procurer de la viande selon lui la deuxiÃ¨me Ã©tape a Ã©tÃ© atteinte entre 19 et 23 millions dannÃ©es et implique dÃ©jÃ une capacitÃ© accrue Ã se procurer de la viande de charogne et peutÃªtre en chassant quant Ã la troisiÃ¨me Ã©tape que h bunn situe entre 16 et 18 million dannÃ©es elle implique la capacitÃ© de voler des carcasses entiÃ¨res aux grands carnivores ou de se les procurer par la chasse mais il y a environ 15 million dannÃ©es homo erectus â que de nombreux palÃ©ontologues nomment aujourdhui homo ergaster â entre en scÃ¨ne plus intelligent capable de se fabriquer des outils en pierre ce premier membre du genre homo Ã nous ressembler est aussi le premier Ã manger davantage de viande ce nest donc pas forcÃ©ment que les hominidÃ©s auraient exterminÃ© les grands carnivores mais quils nauraient pas laissÃ© de place Ã lÃ©mergence de nouvelles espÃ¨ces de grands hypercarnivores cest un peu comme avec la disparition des mammouths qui Ã©tait dÃ©jÃ bien entamÃ©e avec le changement climatique mais les hommes y auraient quand mÃªme donnÃ© le coup de grÃ¢ce la recherche no 484 peter higgs Â« la plupart des donnÃ©es que nous utilisons pour dÃ©terminer la politique publique dans des domaines cruciaux tels que lamÃ©lioration de la santÃ© sont de mauvaise qualitÃ© Â» p21 martin rees ancien prÃ©sident de lacadÃ©mie britannique des sciences les mathÃ©matiques qui rÃ©volutionnent les images numÃ©riques cest vraiment trÃ¨s impressionnant de voir la capacitÃ© des mathÃ©matiques Ã tirer assez dinformation dun seul pixel pour reconstituer une image entiÃ¨re les mathÃ©matiques dominent vÃ©ritablement de plus en plus le monde que ce soit avec google la finance les big data ou les applications numÃ©riques comme celleci a la base cest un peu comme la compression dimage jpeg mais au moment de lacquisition et Ã un degrÃ© bien supÃ©rieur pour autant quon ait affaire Ã des images structurÃ©es cestÃ dire que les pixels ne doivent pas Ãªtre alÃ©atoires avec ce quon appelle des signaux parcimonieux qui sont mesurÃ©s eux de faÃ§on alÃ©atoires et reconstruits ensuite avec le principe du basis pursuit ou minimisation de la normel1 qui fait appel Ã des fonctions particuliÃ¨res dites fonctions convexes avec la thÃ©orie de Â« lacquisition comprimÃ©e Â» les mathÃ©maticiens comme emmanuel candÃ¨s proposent rien moins que de reconstituer des signaux dont on na mesurÃ© que quelques pourcents qui plus est ces mesures doivent Ãªtre faites au hasard ainsi on rÃ©alise des images mÃ©dicales bien plus rapidement quaujourdhui on se contente dun seul pixel pour prendre des photographies ou on trouve plus vite des gÃ¨nes impliquÃ©s dans une maladie des images aussi prÃ©cises avec moins de mesures p28 dÃ¨s la fin des annÃ©es 1970 des gÃ©ologues avaient trouvÃ© le moyen dÃ©tablir une cartographie assez prÃ©cise des strates du soussol en analysant les ondes sismiques qui sy propageaient et cela alors que les signaux quils captaient recelaient trop peu dinformations pour Ãªtre reconstituÃ©s selon le thÃ©orÃ¨me de shannonnyquist cette premiÃ¨re entorse Ã cette loi si fondamentale rÃ©volutionna la prospection pÃ©troliÃ¨re sans que lon sache exactement Ã ce momentlÃ en expliquer les fondements mathÃ©matiques des sismologues avaient toutefois formulÃ© lhypothÃ¨se dite du train dondes Ã impulsions Ã©parses un tel signal est dit parcimonieux en pratique peu de mesures suffisent Ã le reconstruire emmanuel candÃ¨s avec le mÃ©daillÃ©

reconditioning however in mice whose memories were 30 days old it was impossible to eliminate the fearful memory the researchers also found that in the brains of mice with 24hrold memories extensive chromatin remodeling occurred during the reconditioning for several hours after the mice were placed back in the feared chamber there was a dramatic increase in histone acetylation of memoryrelated genes caused by inactivation of the protein hdac2 that histone acetylation makes genes more accessible turning on the processes needed to form new memories or overwrite old ones in mice with 30dayold memories however there was no change in histone acetylation this suggests that reexposure to a fearful memory opens a window of opportunity during which the memory can be altered but only if the memory has recently been formed based on this finding the researchers decided to treat mice with 30dayold memories with an hdac2 inhibitor shortly after reexposure to the feared chamber following this

des cellules contractiles ont Ã©tÃ© mises en culture Ã la jonction entre la tÃªte et la queue sur un revÃªtement de fibronectine les cardiomyocytes de rats se sont alors mis Ã battre au dÃ©but leurs mouvements Ã©taient anarchiques puis progressivement les cellules cardiaques ont commencÃ© Ã se contracter dans la mÃªme direction et en rythme elles ont ainsi participÃ© Ã la production dun mouvement ondulatoire transmis Ã la queue et qui a permis au dispositif davancer les chercheurs destinent leur crÃ©ation Ã des applications mÃ©dicales ou environnementales lorsquils auront trouvÃ© un moyen pour diriger la navigation des biobots ceuxci pourraient par exemple Ãªtre utilisÃ©s pour dÃ©livrer des mÃ©dicaments pratiquer des opÃ©rations microchirurgicales ou cibler des cellules cancÃ©reuses

            "text": "Pour la Science\n\nLa Recherche\n\nPhysique, espace, nanos\n\nClimat, écologie, énergie\n\nBiologie, préhistoire, cerveau\n\nSanté\n\nTechno\n\n\n\n- Economie et social\n\nSur les plans écologique, économique et politique la situation semble assez désespérée malgré une reprise bien fragile. Les gauches n'ont plus rien à dire et découvrent effarées que la France ne se réduit pas à Robespierre, la Commune, Jaurès, 1936, 1968, comme on voulait s'en persuader un peu stupidement alors que, pour une extrême-droite qui a le vent en poupe et nous replonge dans les années 1930, notre Nation bien aimée s'identifierait plutôt aux clochers, à Jeanne d'Arc, aux rois de France, à Napoléon, au colonialisme, à la guerre de 14, Pétain ou même De Gaulle... Le roman national n'est qu'une construction unilatérale et largement fictive destinée à faire croire à l'existence objective de quelque chose comme une Nation ou un Peuple (voire une race), union sacrée qui ne se produit pourtant qu'avec la guerre contre l'ennemi héréditaire dans une société si divisée et une démocratie pluraliste. Par le danger même qu'il représente, il faut reconnaître au populisme sa fonction de symptôme d'une situation bloquée, d'expression d'un besoin de protection mais surtout de \"colère\" impuissante, à se faire menaçant contre les élites et à \"jouer au con\" comme on peut y être amené parfois pour mettre fin aux arguties de l'adversaire. Ce n'est d'ailleurs pas sans effets sur les maîtres de la finance qui redoutent ce facteur d'instabilité politique mais pour l'instant même la Grèce n'y ayant pas cédé malgré la saignée qu'on leur impose, le pire n'est pas le plus probable encore. Heureusement, car à jouer au con, il arrive qu'on le devienne vraiment mais la crise n'en sera que plus longue sans doute. En tout cas, après l'époque d'un néolibéralisme débridé, Davos s'inquiète désormais des risques les plus probables causés par la disparité de revenus, le chômage et le sous-emploi, le réchauffement climatique, la multiplication des évènements météo extrêmes mais aussi les cyber-attaques. Les risques les plus graves, selon eux, seraient plutôt : les crises budgétaires, le chômage et le sous-emploi, les changements climatiques, la crise de l’eau, l’effondrement d’Internet... Des chercheurs prétendent que des investissements purement aléatoires pourraient calmer les fièvres des marchés sauf que ce n'est pas un phénomène physique qui produit bulles et krachs mais des processus plus profonds (avantages à court terme, croyances sociales, cycles à long terme) et que la cause du krach est la bulle précédente qui est difficile à réguler puisque cela voudrait dire mettre un terme à des gains profitables à la plupart des acteurs mais une fois qu'on a décollé, il faut bien atterrir.\n\nEn tout cas, les bouleversements sociaux de l'accélération technologique ne font que commencer, pouvant affecter un domaine aussi vaste que les métiers de la construction avec des imprimantes 3D capables maintenant d'édifier une maison en 24 heures ! Paradoxalement, il se pourrait que ce ne soit plus le secteur secondaire qui tire l'économie mais, pour un temps au moins, le secteur primaire avec le monde des céréales devenu moteur de la croissance mondiale, étant au cœur de deux des principales révolutions technologiques qui sont en train de se mettre en place à l'échelle de la planète, les NTE (Nouvelles Technologies de l'Energie) et les NTA (Nouvelles Technologies de l'Agro-alimentaire), il faudrait ajouter la reconversion agro-écologique mais il y a aussi, par exemple, des capteurs dans la terre qui permettraient d'améliorer significativement les rendements avec des traitements plus appropriés (arrosage, etc.). Même si ce n'est pas vraiment nouveau, un autre paradoxe, c'est qu'en Allemagne, la filière bio n’arrive plus à satisfaire la demande qui explose. Résultat : un tiers du bio consommé est importé ! Sinon, les Allemands veulent favoriser le stockage domestique de l'énergie solaire plutôt que le stockage sur le réseau ou par de grandes infrastructures. En France, un rapport de la cour des comptes (très contesté) critique les mesures en faveur des énergies renouvelables, responsables de la création de bulles artificielles, alors qu'il faudrait privilégier les économies d'énergie, notamment dans l'agriculture. \"Le modèle de consommation, plus que le système de production, tel est bien, en définitive, ce qu’il conviendrait de modifier\" (en fait les 2 sont nécessaires). Pour l'instant, la réalité, c'est qu'on n'a jamais produit autant de pétrole. Même si c'est difficilement crédible à si courte échéance, il est remarquable qu'une étude de prospective pour 2020 prévoit l'invasion de toutes sortes de robots mais en contrepartie l'instauration d'un revenu minimum garanti pour tous. On peut être surpris aussi d'apprendre que malgré ou à cause de ses progrès, désormais la médecine constitue la 3ème cause de mortalité, juste après le cancer et les crises cardiaques ! La revue Prescrire dénonce d'ailleurs 68 médicaments plus dangereux qu'utile ainsi que l’absence en 2013 de nouveaux médicaments intéressants. Même les antioxydants seraient à proscrire. A rebours des évolutions actuelles, l'Académie de médecine dérape en s'opposant à l'autorisation du Sativex (comme dans de nombreux autres pays) confirmant qu'il y a véritablement un problème en France avec le cannabis alors que la légalisation du cannabis gagne du terrain partout et qu'on daigne enfin tirer partie des vertus de drogues comme l'ectasy contre l'anxiété.\n\n\n\n- Sciences\n\nJ'ai retrouvé un certain plaisir cette fois à faire cette revue (mais cela prend bien trop de temps), La Recherche notamment m'ayant bien intéressé (ce qui est assez rare) avec la puissance incroyable des mathématiques de la \"parcimonie\", les traces d'une civilisation européenne il y a 5000 ans, l'imagerie médicale qui rend compte de la conscience comme inhibition des réactions primaires (et se passe très bien des conceptions \"quantiques\" qu'en propose Penrose par ailleurs). Pour la Science n'est pas en reste avec la découverte de neurones correspondant à des concepts, ainsi que la confirmation assez incroyable des bouleversements écologiques provoqués par nos ancêtres lorsqu'ils sont devenus carnivores, faisant remonter l'anthropocène à plus d'1 million d'années ! Revenir aux données astronomiques du temps de Copernic permet de comprendre également les objections rationnelles qui pouvaient y être fait à l'époque et pas du tout seulement les préjugés religieux.\n\nDu côté des brèves, pour la physique le plus extraordinaire serait la possibilité de téléporter de l'énergie à grandes distances mais il y a aussi Hawking qui radicalise sa conception des trous \"noirs\", qui ne le sont plus tout-à-fait soumis aux fluctuations quantiques. Ce qu'on appelle l'hypothèse Gaïa se trouve étonnement renforcée par la découverte incroyable que la vie pourrait favoriser volcanisme et tectonique des plaques, qui eux-mêmes la font évoluer vers la complexité... A l'opposé des hypothèses de départ de James Lovelock, ce ne serait donc en rien une autorégulation puisque producteur de catastrophes plutôt, dynamique résultant d'une déstabilisation mutuelle, mais on n'imaginait pas une telle interaction entre le physique et le biologique! Une des grandes remises en cause du mois, c'est une réévaluation complète de la part du génome hérité de Neandertal qui n'est plus du tout négligeable et de l'ordre de 1% mais pourrait dépasser les 20% répartis dans la population (même si chacun n'en a que très peu). Par ailleurs, la viabilité de macaques génétiquement modifiés avec une technique très précise d'édition des gènes (nommée Crispr) destinée à des animaux de laboratoire semble bien ouvrir la voie aux hommes génétiquement modifiés et au transhumanisme tant redouté (si des essais se font, ils ne devraient pas être divulgués avant des années sans doute). En attendant, on peut s'extasier d'avoir trouvé dans l'insula le circuit de l'extase (ou effet Dostoïevski précédent certaines crises épileptiques) qui pourrait participer aux expériences mystiques (compromission incontestable du corps avec la religion). Que dire du bienfait de pouvoir effacer une mémoire  récente avec un inhibiteur de HDAC2 ? Plus facile que d'effacer ses traces sur internet ? L'usage devrait en rester confidentiel, mais qui sait ? Par contre, ce qui nous fait entrer à coup sûr dans une ère nouvelle, c'est le séquençage du génome à 1000$ et l'analyse génétique gène à gène accélérée mais aussi la nanomédecine. Si l'on en croit toutes les recherches en cours, les nanoparticules sont vraiment l'avenir de la médecine, version scientifique de l'homéopathie agissant à doses infimes sur des cellules ou des processus précisément ciblés. Parfois, cependant, un simple remède comme l'aspirine suffirait à réduire les macromutations responsables des métastases cancéreuses...\n\n\n\n- Numérique\n\nSelon une étude contestable, le déclin de Facebook pourrait être comme celui de MySpace comparable à une fin d'épidémie, ce dont Facebook se moque, réfutant avec force graphiques le lien fait ici entre les recherches sur Facebook et son niveau d'activité effective, n'imaginant pas un instant qu'il soit possible de perdre 950 millions d’utilisateurs en quelques années seulement ! Il faut effectivement prendre en compte les masses en jeu qui augmentent considérablement l'inertie d'un système mais il peut y avoir tout de même des mouvements de masse et on peut craindre que plus vite une nouvelle technologie décolle, plus vite elle disparaît (sauf si on innove sans cesse comme Google mais peut-être pas assez Facebook?). En tout cas, c'est dans le domaine du numérique que les pays riches devraient perdre en premier leur suprématie, les internautes des pays les plus peuplés étant déjà majoritaires, y compris dans les réseaux sociaux. On n'est qu'au début d'une véritable tectonique des plaques qui va changer les rapports de force comme les modes de vie.\n\nParmi les innovations les plus étranges du mois, et bien que cela ne soit peut-être jamais mis en oeuvre, il faut signaler l'étonnant brevet déposé par Amazon qui compterait se baser sur les commandes précédentes, vos recherches, listes de souhaits, et le temps passé sur le site afin de déterminer ce qu’ils doivent pré-envoyer vers chez vous ! Sinon, l'holographie devrait finir par s'imposer dans les années qui viennent maintenant qu'elle atteint les performances des vidéos. Plus anecdotique, des livres sensitifs proposent l'expérience de \"fictions sensorielles\" grâce à un gilet sensitif connecté. Ce livre augmenté détecte donc à quelle page le lecteur en est et adapte pression, chaleur et vibrations du gilet à l'action en cours. Peu de chance qu'il y ait un public pour cela quand des casques d'immersion assez bluffants n'arrivent pas encore à décoller. Une application qui pourrait être utile cette fois et justifier leur achat pour autre chose que pour jouer : les Google glass surveillent l'endormissement au volant ! Est-ce que cela suffira à faire un succès pour autant de ce qui reste de l'ordre du gadget pour l'instant ?\n\nLa domotique non plus ne décolle toujours pas malgré les efforts de compatibilité qui sont faits. En tout cas Google s'y investit et on pourrait bientôt accéder à sa chambre d'hôtel avec son smartphone. Un véritable problème, c'est que l'internet des choses est trop vulnérable alors même que ce secteur explose en ce moment. Enfin, on pourrait gérer le trafic ferroviaire de l'espace et un algorithme promet de minimiser les émissions de CO2 (de 20%) ou la consommation électrique (de 60%) du cloud dont la montée en puissance est effectivement assez préoccupante, nécessitant à l'évidence une meilleure efficacité énergétique.\n\n\n\n\n\nPour la Science no 436, L'impression 3D\n\n\n\n- Le cœur artificiel n’est pas une priorité médicale, p12\n\n- Pourquoi ils n'ont pas cru Copernic, p74\n\nIl est très intéressant de ne pas projeter après coup la connaissance que nous en avons et de voir que les arguments des opposants étaient tout-à-fait raisonnables et convaincants.\n\n- Comment le cerveau code les concepts, p46\n\nCela fait partie des nouvelles les plus surprenantes (et pas encore assez étayées), qu'un neurone puisse être lié spécifiquement à une personne ou un objet, non pas sa forme ou ses transformation mais son concept, sa permanence, sa désignation, son être peut-on dire. Mais justement, il n'est pas si clair de savoir de quoi on parle exactement. Il faudrait faire la part entre la fonction du langage (où le concept procède par division : Omnis determinatio est negatio) et la réduction à un trait particulier (saillance) ou à un noeud d'associations d'un ensemble de caractères ou bien plutôt un processus conceptuel de généralisation, d'abstraction (des détails particuliers).\n\nCe dernier paragraphe identifie un peu trop l'expérience à notre spécificité humaine car au moins certains animaux doivent posséder ces capacités conceptuelles qu'il ne faut pas confondre avec les capacités langagières.\n\n- L'homme devenu carnivore, les grands carnivores disparaissent, p62\n\n\n\n C'est la confirmation que l'homme est bien \"le vrai roi des animaux\" se situant au sommet de la pyramide alimentaire bien qu'on reste incrédule devant une empreinte écologique si dévastatrice à une époque où nous étions si peu nombreux mais on peut admettre que le superprédateur que nous devenions ait \"un impact plus fort que la réintroduction du loup\". Il est un fait que les grands animaux n'ont pas survécus longtemps à la présence d'hommes sur leur territoire (que ce soit en Europe, en Amérique, en Australie) sauf les éléphants mais les grands prédateurs ont bien disparus d'Afrique aussi. L'utilisation du feu a sans doute accéléré le passage à une nourriture carnivore et devrait dès lors remonter à 1,5 millions d'années au moins (ce qui est loin d'être solidement prouvé encore voir plus bas).\n\nCe n'est donc pas forcément que les hominidés auraient exterminé les grands carnivores mais qu'ils n'auraient pas laissé de place à l'émergence de nouvelles espèces de grands hypercarnivores. C'est un peu comme avec la disparition des mammouths qui était déjà bien entamée avec le changement climatique mais les hommes y auraient quand même donné le coup de grâce.\n\n\n\nLa Recherche no 484, Peter Higgs\n\n\n\n\n\n- Les mathématiques qui révolutionnent les images numériques\n\nC'est vraiment très impressionnant de voir la capacité des mathématiques à tirer assez d'information d'un seul pixel pour reconstituer une image entière. Les mathématiques dominent véritablement de plus en plus le monde que ce soit avec Google, la finance, les Big Data ou les applications numériques comme celle-ci. A la base, c'est un peu comme la compression d'image (jpeg) mais au moment de l'acquisition et à un degré bien supérieur pour autant qu'on ait affaire à des images structurées, c'est-à-dire que les pixels ne doivent pas être aléatoires, avec ce qu'on appelle des signaux \"parcimonieux\" qui sont mesurés eux de façon aléatoires et reconstruits ensuite avec le principe du \"basis pursuit\" ou \"minimisation de la norme-L1\" qui fait appel à des fonctions particulières dites \"fonctions convexes\"...\n\n- Des images aussi précises avec moins de mesures, p28\n\n- Emmanuel Candès : « Nous avons développé les mathématiques de la parcimonie »\n\n\n\n- Raisonner, c'est inhiber nos intuitions, p66\n\nDans son dernier Que sais-je sur \"Le raisonnement\", Olivier Houdé expose les résultats de ses travaux en imagerie cérébrale mettant en évidence un troisième système venant s'ajouter aux 2 systèmes identifiés par Daniel Kahneman, le premier rapide et intuitif (souvent pertinent mais responsable des \"biais cognitifs\") et le second plus lent et réfléchi (rationnel). En fait on pourrait identifier un troisième système dit \"exécutif\", localisé dans le cortex préfrontal et qui se caractériserait par sa \"résistance cognitive\" (ce qu'on pourrait identifier à la conscience elle-même?). On pourrait objecter que ce troisième système sensé nous aiguiller entre intuition et raisonnement ne se distingue pas tellement  de celui-ci puisque consistant à interrompre une réponse automatique pour en trouver une plus appropriée par la réflexion. Comme il s'agit de localisation cérébrale, on peut admettre que le raisonnement soit localisé dans un module spécialisé différent de la conscience initiale, son éveil dû pour Laborit à un \"manque d'information\" mais qu'on peut assimiler aussi à la correction d'erreurs. Ce qui est de l'ordre du calcul reste effectivement largement inconscient, ce qui nous intéresse étant le résultat. Sinon, même si ce n'est pas une notion familière pour la plupart, la fonction inhibitrice de la pensée n'a rien de nouveau, on la retrouve bien avant, notamment en éthologie mais aussi avec la théories des 3 cerveaux, etc. Il est toujours bon d'en avoir des confirmations observationnelles.\n\nDes chercheurs californiens viennent de localiser la zone d'arbitrage du cerveau dans le putamen postérieur.\n\n- « Le monde numérique simplifie la pensée », p76\n\nL'interview de Jean-Michel Besnier, qui vient de sortir \"L'homme simplifié\", est à se tordre. Il devrait vraiment inhiber ses intuitions. Dénoncer une simplification de la pensée avec une pensée si simpliste vaut démonstration du niveau lamentable de nos intellectuels médiatiques à la Finkielkraut tellement admiratifs d'eux-mêmes, de leur pauvre pensée et de leur culture rance, petits esprits incapables de s'ouvrir au trésor de ce nouveau monde de connaissances partagés qui les renvoie effectivement à leur préhistoire. Pas étonnant qu'il se réfère aux exagérations de Günther Anders (que tout le monde prenait pour un imbécile d'Heidegger à l'Ecole de Francfort). C'est vraiment un ramassis de préjugés et d'une certaine vulgate ressassée, la critique convenue d'un humanisme chrétien sans beaucoup de rapports avec la réalité et qui surtout ne sert à rien, idéalisme pétri de bons sentiments qui s'imagine qu'on serait maîtres de la technique au lieu d'en être les sujets historiques ! C'est d'un tel conformisme creux qu'il y a bien de quoi rire, en effet.\n\nCe n'est pas bien sûr que le numérique n'ait ses nuisances et ses pathologies cognitives, encore moins que par miracle tout le monde accède au savoir, on y trouve toutes les arnaques et trolls de la planète, tous les extrémismes, les sectes les plus absurdes et même des groupuscules technophobes ! mais on y trouve aussi de précieuses ressources alors que les folles idéologies du XXè siècle n'avaient absolument pas besoin d'internet pour délirer et entraîner des foules immenses dans des massacres industriels au nom de pensées on ne peut plus simplistes.\n\n- « Contrairement à l'homme, la femme est une mosaïque », Edith Heard, p70\n\nOn croit qu'on va avoir affaire à des stéréotypes sur la féminité, mais pas du tout, c'est juste génétique : les garçons héritent presque tout de leur mère et à un seul exemplaire, le chromosome Y ne servant pas à grand chose, alors que les filles mélangent les caractères de la mère et du père (et sont plus résistantes car ayant en double tous les gènes).\n\n\n\n - L'unité européenne, il y a 5000 ans\n\nLa diffusion à partir de l'Espagne de poteries et autres objets typiques à travers toute l'Europe, malgré de grandes différences culturelles, a fait parler d'une mystérieuse civilisation campaniforme témoignant déjà de la formation d'une certaine unité européenne dans ces temps reculés, ce qui n'est peut-être pas si étonnant du fait, non signalé dans l'article, que la majorité des européens actuels descendraient des premiers agriculteurs espagnols (ou c'est cette diaspora de l'époque qui expliquerait leur prévalence génétique ?).\n\ncosmologie, physique quantique, nanotechnologies\n\n- Un u-bit intriqué avec tout l'univers pour remplacer les nombres imaginaires\n\n Si cette reformulation de la théorie quantique avec des Ubits permettrait de se passer de la partie imaginaire des équations et de rendre compte de l'intrication de nombreux éléments entre eux (pas seulement 2), cela impliquerait une rotation très rapide sur eux-mêmes des Ubits mais aussi une décohérence spontanée empêchant de faire des ordinateurs quantiques avec de nombreux Qbits.\n\n \n\n - L'énergie noire est une constante et l'univers est bien plat\n\nVoir aussi Pour la Science.\n\n- Etudier l'énergie sombre dans le vide\n\nPour certaines théories, l'énergie sombre ne serait pas une constante mais dépendrait de la présence de matière ou non. Etudier les plus grandes poches de vide permettrait de voir si leur expansion est supérieure aux zones les plus peuplées de l'espace.\n\n\n\n- Pour Stephen Hawking, les trous noirs ne le sont pas complètement\n\nIl n'y aurait pas vraiment d'horizon immuable mais seulement fluctuant et pouvant donc laisser s'échapper la lumière. C'est juste 2 pages sans formules mais une réinterprétation bien plus puissante que ce qui l'a rendu célèbre d'une thermodynamique des trous noirs dont seul s'échappaient la moitié des paires de particules-antiparticules se créant dans le vide.\n\nVoir aussi Sciences et avenir et surtout l'article de Laurent Sacco.\n\n\n\n - Les équations de Navier-Stokes enfin résolues\n\n- La téléportation de l'énergie à grandes distances\n\nVoir aussi Futura-Sciences. Un autre système, plus classique, permet d'étendre la distance de transmission de l'énergie par ondes grâce à une superlentille.\n\n\n\n - Canaliser les flux de chaleur\n\n\n\n\n\nclimat, énergies, écologie\n\n- 62 ans de réchauffement climatique\n\n- L'oscillation pacifique devrait relâcher sa chaleur dans quelques années\n\n- La fonte des glaces relâche de la chlorine qui oxyde le méthane\n\n- La transition énergétique à l'horizon 2050\n\n- Le pétrole de schiste américain devrait plafonner en 2016\n\n- Des nanotubes dopés au soufre pour absorber huile ou pétrole\n\n\n\n - Exploiter tout le spectre solaire en le convertissant en chaleur\n\nVoir aussi Futura-Sciences.\n\n- Remplacer le platine par du cobalt pour la photosynthèse\n\n- Des sphères design pour concentrer l’énergie solaire\n\n- Des micro-éoliennes pour les mobiles, les micro-robots, la maison...\n\n- L'éolien principal producteur d'électricité en Espagne\n\n\n\n\n\n- Transformation plus efficace de l'électricité en gaz\n\n- Des centrales \"omnivores\" pour produire du bio-méthane à la demande\n\nL'astuce est de séparer la production de sucres de la production de gaz, ce qui permet d'adapter la production de gaz à la demande.\n\n- Production de gaz avec des bactéries modifiées et du sucre\n\nInnovation européenne. Audi investit dans Global Bioenergies pour produire par génie génétique un gaz, l'isobutène, facilement transformé en essence, au lieu de l'éthanol dont le marché est saturé. L'avantage principal est que le gaz s'échappe, facilement récupéré mais surtout ne contamine pas ainsi le milieu des bactéries modifiées, l'accumulation d'éthanol par exemple finissant par être toxique pour les microorganismes et mettant un terme à la production.\n\n- Eliminer facilement la lignine\n\n Eliminer simplement la lignine permet de baisser drastiquement les coûts de la transformation de végétaux en biofuel.\n\nOn pourrait utiliser aussi le GVL (gamma valerolactone) pour extraire le sucre des plantes.\n\n\n\n- Transformer le méthane en éthylène à moitié prix (actuel) du pétrole\n\nNon seulement on ne connaît pas la composition de ce nouveau catalyseur mais il semble difficile d'arrêter la réaction à la production d'éthylène qui devrait se transformer rapidement en eau et CO2. D'autres améliorent la conversion en méthanol. A signaler aussi des progrès dans les biocarburants obtenus avec des bactéries. Des bactéries modifiées en leur ajoutant une methylase produit du butanol et du biodiesel.\n\n\n\n - Des batteries à flux redox organiques rapides et bon marché\n\nLa capacité de ces batteries n'étant limité que par la taille des réservoirs, on envisage même d'acheter de l'électricité quand les prix sont bas pour la revendre quand ils montent...\n\n- Modifier le sulfure de molybdène pour remplacer le platine dans la production d'hydrogène\n\n- De l'eau potable avec de l'eau de mer et du soleil\n\n- Des vitres qui s’obscurcissent à la lumière\n\névolution, génétique, éthologie, anthropologie, neurologie\n\n- C'est la vie qui provoquerait volcanisme et tectonique des plaques\n\nL’hypothèse Gaïa s'en trouverait renforcée d'une planète forgée par la vie et donc en relatif équilibre avec elle, sauf que c'est bien plutôt une déstabilisation mutuelle, une dynamique qui ne connaît pas de repos.\n\nEffectivement, en retour le volcanisme et notamment au moment du Cambrien aurait été décisif dans l'explosion de l'évolution à cette époque, obligeant à s'adapter à des changements brutaux de l'environnement.\n\nL'explosion des multicellulaires viendrait aussi d'une meilleure captation des nutriments dans les courants marins.\n\n \n\n\n\n - Des cellules dans l'acide citrique pendant 30mn deviennent pluripotentes\n\nVoir aussi Technology Review et Futura-Sciences. Il a été confirmé depuis que cela marche aussi avec des cellules humaines. Il se pourrait que ce soit la vitesse de réplication (moins de 8h, ce qui est peu) qui soit déterminante dans la transformation en cellule pluripotente et le rajeunissement de la cellule (importante découverte si elle est confirmée). Il n'est pas impossible sinon que ce soit l'acide citrique qui permet ici cette rétro-évolution et non \"le stress\" (on avait déjà vu que l'acide citrique pouvait avoir été un élément essentiel des débuts de la vie). De toutes façons la facilité d'obtention ainsi de quasi cellules souches à parti de cellules différenciées pourrait constituer une véritable rupture dans leur utilisation généralisée.\n\n- Le mécanisme quantique de la photosynthèse\n\nVoir aussi Futura-Sciences.\n\n\n\n- L'adaptation au froid des plantes à fleur\n\n- Plus un arbre est vieux, plus il pousse vite\n\nIl n'est donc pas si rare d'être de plus en plus performant à mesure qu'on prend de l'âge.\n\n- L'ancêtre des araignées, il y a 425 millions d'années\n\n- Des milliers d'abeilles suivies\n\n- Les requins premiers animaux migrateurs\n\n\n\n - Les requins éléphants ont le moins évolué depuis 400 millions d'années\n\nVoir aussi Sciences et Avenir. Ce serait que ces évolutions ont été éliminées par la sélection naturelle ne conservant que les spécimens les plus archaïques ?\n\n\n\n- L'ancêtre européen des mammifères carnivores (chats, chiens, ours, phoques)\n\n- Les primates consomment moins et vivent plus vieux que les autres mammifères\n\nVoir aussi Futura-Sciences. Mais il y a un revers de la médaille car les mécanismes de sénescence ont un effet anticancéreux.\n\n- L'extinction du plus grand des singes à cause de mauvais fruits\n\n\n\n Si Gigantopithecus, un singe de 3 mètres encore présent à l'âge de pierre a fini par disparaître, ce serait à cause de la dernière glaciation le faisant se rabattre sur des fruits pas assez énergétiques.\n\n\n\n- Les petites différences entre cerveaux de singes et d'hommes\n\n- Ce qui nous caractérise : la narration (les scénarios)\n\nIl y a sans doute aussi nos types de neurones, leur plus grande diversité génétique, etc. Mais le langage narratif semble quand même bien ce qui nous sépare de l'animalité.\n\nIl y aurait un des 12 modules du cortex préfrontal qui nous serait propre.\n\n- Notre gros cerveau viendrait de la sélection sexuelle\n\nC'est effectivement sans doute, et comme toujours, les relations sociales qui sont à l'origine des gros cerveaux mais il est stupide de dire qu'on n'en avait pas besoin pour la survie puisque c'est bien ce gros cerveau qui nous a permis de survivre aux autres espèces.\n\n\n\n\n\n - Maîtrise du feu entre 1 million et 300 000 ans\n\nCela ne veut pas dire que le feu était aussi maîtrisé il y a 1 million d'années, date où cependant la consommation de viande a nettement augmentée avec des conséquences sur la disparition des grands prédateurs comme on l'a vu plus haut.\n\n- Reconstitution de Sapiens et Neandertal\n\nOn peut douter de cette reconstitution car, dans les gènes hérités de Neandertal, il y aurait une peau claire (BNC2), ce qui m'a toujours paru évident, tout comme la protection de maladies locales, mais que plusieurs études réfutaient (cela n'aurait pas été le même gène). De toutes façons on nous disait qu'il n'y avait aucun gène commun, seulement de l'ADN poubelle... Ces gènes, surtout sur le chromosome Y (parce que seuls étaient viables un père Neandertal et une mère sapiens ou simplement que les enfants restant avec leur mère, les croisement dans l'autre sens ont disparus avec les Néandertaliens ?), auraient été sans aucun doute très minoritaires au départ, les quelques croisements viables ayant été très exceptionnels, avant de se généraliser à toute la population européenne ou asiatique mais, Neandertal nous aurait transmis aussi ses maladies telles que le diabète de type 2, le lupus et la maladie de Crohn. Une étude purement mathématique prétend qu'on trouverait de 20% à 40% de gènes de Neandertal, réparties dans la population, ce qui semble beaucoup cette fois... Voir aussi Futura-Sciences.\n\n- Les Sapiens chasseurs-cueilleurs européens avaient les yeux bleus\n\nC'est au moins le cas d'un Espagnol d'il y a 7000 ans, le plus vieux génome qu'on en a pour l'instant, mais s'il avait les yeux bleus, il avait la peau noire et le type africain au moins pour les cheveux (comme sur la représentation donnée ?!).\n\nVoir aussi Sciences et Avenir.\n\n- La chirurgie Inca\n\n- L'agressivité des enfants largement génétique\n\n- Les (prétendues) bases quantiques de la conscience\n\nCertes, Penrose n'est pas n'importe qui mais l'explication de la conscience par la physique quantique n'est pas chose nouvelle et relève plus de l'obscurantisme : expliquer un mystère par un mystère plus grand ! La conscience comme question ou émotion ne pose guère de problème interprétée à partir des connexions entre neurones, mobilisation des connaissances accumulées, de la perception et déclenchement des hormones adaptées, tout cela filtré par le langage narratif et sous la pression sociale. La seule chose intéressante de cette étude est de confirmer l'existence de processus quantiques à température ambiante, comme on l'avait déjà constaté avec la photosynthèse. Qu'il y ait incontestablement des phénomènes quantiques dans le cerveau n'implique pas du tout qu'ils soient décisifs alors que le cerveau est excessivement brouillé.\n\n- Parler mobilise les 2 côtés du cerveau\n\nLe fait d'étudier l'activité du cerveau avec des électrodes réfute le fait que le langage soit latéralisé.\n\nPar ailleurs, une carte des phonèmes dans le cerveau pourrait permettre de lire dans les pensées.\n\n\n\n- Observation de la formation de la mémoire\n\nVoir aussi Sciences et Avenir. On a aussi reconstitué le cerveau d'un patient dépourvu de toute capacité de mémorisation car on lui avait enlevé l'hippocampe des deux côtés de son cerveau.\n\n- La mémoire des premières années se perd à 7 ans\n\nLes enfants de 3 ans se souviennent de leurs années précédentes, sans bien repérer le temps, mais pas après 7 ans où la mémoire se réorganise avec une chronologie plus précise et pris dans un récit.\n\nLe cerveau complèterait avec des détails inventés, du coup les souvenirs d'enfance ne sont pas fiables du tout, en particulier dans les affaires de justice.\n\n- Les cauchemars entre agressions, conflits, poursuites et autres terreurs\n\nIl y aurait aussi une différence selon le sexe, avec une prévalence des catastrophes naturelles chez les hommes et des conflits interpersonnels chez les femmes...\n\n- Les émotions du corps\n\nIl y aurait aussi un lien entre suicide et hyporéactivité.\n\ntraitements, nutrition, hygiène\n\n- Une puce dans le cerveau pour commander un muscle paralysé\n\n\n\n La functional electrical stimulation (FES) envoie des signaux à pas moins de 18 muscles du bras et de la main pour permettre au patient, qui est paralysé à partir du cou, de pouvoir manger ou se gratter le nez tout seul.\n\n \n\n\n\n - L'effet Dostoïevski de l'extase épileptique localisé dans l'insula\n\nOn a bien ce ralentissement du temps lors d'un accident...\n\n- L'ecstasy contre l'anxiété\n\n- L'effet des probiotiques sur l'anxiété\n\nLe rôle désormais reconnu (on n'en est qu'au début cependant) des bactéries intestinales sur l'anxiété, les TOC, l'autisme était auparavant réservé aux médecines parallèles...\n\n- Un opiacé qui ne serait ni addictif ni dépressif ?\n\nLes substances ciblant le récepteur KOR (kappa opioid receptor) des cellules nerveuses contrôlant la libération de dopamine ont bien un effet anti-douleur mais aussi un effet dépressif en éliminant la molécule βarrestin2 (beta arrestin) contrairement à un nouvel agoniste \"biaisé\" prometteur.\n\n- L'encens contre la douleur et l'inflammation\n\n- Effacer une mémoire  récente avec un inhibiteur de HDAC2\n\nVoir aussi Futura-Sciences. On avait vu le mois dernier qu'on pouvait effacer des souvenirs par électrochocs, cette technique est quand même plus douce et confirme la capacité d'effacer des souvenirs ciblés.\n\n- Les vieux sont plus lents car ils savent plus de choses\n\n- Réduire l'inflammation responsable de l'alzheimer\n\nLe DDT serait un facteur de l'alzheimer aussi important que la génétique.\n\n- Parkinson : la thérapie génique donne un (léger) espoir\n\nVoir aussi Futura-Sciences.\n\n\n\n - Des microparticules pour bloquer la réponse immunitaire\n\nVoir aussi Futura-Sciences.\n\n- Des vaccins à la demande\n\nUn des intérêts, c'est qu'il n'y aurait aucun besoin de stocker des vaccins au frais.\n\n- Des nanoparticules pour détecter les maladies\n\nIl s'agit d'une membrane en polymère (polyéthylène glycol) contenant une substance qui n'est délivrée que lorsque un brin d'ADN à sa surface rencontre un signal spécifique (un gène pathogène, etc.).\n\n\n\n- Piéger les virus avec des nanoparticules avant qu'ils ne nous infectent\n\nOn avait déjà parlé de projets semblables mais ces nanoparticules semblent déjà opérationnelles et couvrant toute une série de virus. Le fait que cela ne provoquerait pas de résistance est par contre douteux car il y aura bien sélection des virus échappant à ce pièges. Un autre système s'attaque aux cellules déjà infectées (DRACO ou Double-stranded RNA Activated Caspase Oligomerizer).\n\n- Contrôler les cellules de l'intérieur avec des nanoparticules\n\n“Once those particles are internalized into the cells, which can take on the order of 6 to 24 hrs, we can deliver the transplant immediately or even cryopreserve the cells,” Karp said. “When the cells are thawed at the patient’s bedside, they can be administered and the agents will start to be released inside the cells to control differentiation, immune modulation or matrix production, for example”.\n\n- Un BioBot (minirobot biologique) imite la nage du spermatozoïde\n\nDes chercheurs sont parvenus à créer une machine microscopique mise en mouvement par des cellules cardiaques de rats. Elle peut donc se déplacer dans un milieu liquide, comme les spermatozoïdes auxquels elles ressemblent, et ce malgré les forces de viscosité qui s’opposent à leurs mouvements.\n\nVoir aussi Science Daily. Une étude a mis en évidences les mécanismes des nanomoteurs cellulaires.\n\n- Des nanoparticules pour réparer des lésions\n\nIl y a aussi une colle composée de glycérol et d’acide sébacique qui se met à durcir à la lumière ultraviolette.\n\n- L'aspirine contre les macromutations et les métastases cancéreuses\n\nLes macromutations seraient un processus essentiel dans la différenciation des espèces (les monstres prometteurs de Richard Goldschmidt) mais seraient aussi responsables des métastases cancéreuses, notamment par la réorganisation à grande échelle du génome suite à un doublement des chromosomes résultant d'une division inachevée de la cellule. Avoir une copie de tous les gènes rend en effet la cellule plus tolérante à des mutations de grande ampleur. Un autre phénomène proche mais moins exceptionnel pourrait entrer en ligne de compte, ce qu'on appelle les \"transposons\" qui sont des copies anarchiques de segments d'ADN pouvant doubler des gènes et donc favoriser leurs mutations (il y a d'abord redondance avant la perte de redondance postulée par Atlan, ce qui se vérifie pour l'évolution des plantes à fleurs à partir de la duplication d'un gène architecte mais de nouveaux gènes peuvent venir aussi le l'ADN \"non codant\" qui peuvent être d'anciens gènes désactivés). Le cancer ne résulterait donc pas de petites mutations successives.\n\nDu coup, la chimiothérapie pourrait favoriser les métastases en déstabilisant le génome. Une meilleure piste pourrait être de ralentir au contraire le taux de mutations, ce que justement l'aspirine ferait en réduisant l'inflammation, expliquant son action anti-cancer.\n\n- Tuer les métastases dans le sang\n\n- Identification de GRK3 comme facteur de métastases du cancer de la prostate\n\n- Marcher vite est meilleur pour la prostate\n\nCela permettrait une meilleure irrigation sanguines et moins d'irrégularités dans les vaisseaux.\n\n- Le sommeil protègerait du cancer de la prostate\n\n- Une injection de siRNA guérirait du cancer du sein (chez la souris)\n\n- Récupérer les ARN d'une cellule vivante (cancéreuse)\n\n\n\n The new RNA-focused method starts with an engineered molecule or “tag” that can make its way into a cell without disrupting the cell’s membrane. The tags enter many cells but do not grab onto RNA until they are activated by light. The researchers can then use a laser beam to activate the tags in only a single cell. A few more steps of molecular biology and the researchers have a pool of RNA that came from just a single cell.\n\n- Les anti-oxydants favoriseraient certains cancers\n\nNotamment dans le cancer du poumon des fumeurs et peut-être pour celui de la prostate, les anti-oxydants (du moins la vitamine E) aideraient les cellules cancéreuses à survivre et se multiplier en les protégeant des radicaux libres mais surtout en désactivant le fameux gène p53 gardien de l'intégrité du génome (et déjà inhibé par le tabac).\n\nIl était bien connu que vitamines E, D et A deviennent nocives en surconsommation. Cela n'est pas le cas de la vitamine C par contre et n'empêche pas que les bienfaits des anti-oxydants soient constatés pour les personnes âgées au moins et dans diverses affections (comme la cataracte) mais on en connaît aussi le rôle délétère dans les infections et la mortalité supérieure de ceux qui prennent régulièrement des vitamines...\n\nVoir aussi Sciences et Avenir et Futura-Sciences.\n\n- Sélection de bactériophages contre les infections bactériennes nosocomiales\n\nOn a aussi trouvé un bactériophage qui s'attaque aux bactérie de l'anthrax. Le problème, c'est bien que la bactérie va effectivement continuer à évoluer, c'est une course poursuite...\n\n- Transformer des cellules souches adipeuses en os\n\n\n\nIl suffirait de phosphate de calcium.\n\n- Le stylo qui répare les os\n\n\n\n - Imprimer des cellules rétinienne contre la dégénérescence maculaire\n\n\n\n Scientists can grow single layers of cells in cultures, but printing may be a more effective way to engineer new tissues and organs, which are made of multiple different cell types positioned in intricate three-dimensional orientations. The retina, for example, is a highly organized, multilayered structure composed of various types of neurons and non-neuronal cells. The new ink-jet technique makes it possible to place retinal cells in “very precise and special arrangements”.\n\nRebuilding the retina is an extremely difficult challenge, because “you have to reconstruct what is basically a small computer” whose function arises from a very complicated architecture in which multiple cell layers are connected in a number of different ways.\n\n- Le thé vert réduit le cortisol\n\n- Le café améliore la mémoire à long terme\n\nL'effet est cependant relié à la dose qui ne doit être ni trop faible (100mg) ni trop forte (300mg).\n\n\n\n - Les pommes contre le cholestérol\n\n- Un Viagra féminin à base de mélatonine\n\nConçu à partir de mélatonine de synthèse, le médicament agit directement au niveau du cerveau pour accroître la libido.

            "body": "climateer investing january 2014 but none of the climate simulations carried out for the ipcc produced this particular hiatus at this particular time that has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared others say that this conclusion goes against the longterm temperature trends as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past and many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively shortterm blip in the climate if you are interested in global climate change your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years says susan solomon a climate scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge but even those scientists who remain confident in the underlying models acknowledge that there is increasing pressure to work out just what is happening today a few years ago you saw the hiatus but it could be dismissed because it was well within the noise says gabriel vecchi a climate scientist at the us national oceanic and atmospheric administrations geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory in princeton new jersey now its something to explain researchers have followed various leads in recent years focusing mainly on a trio of factors the sun 1 atmospheric aerosol particles 2 and the oceans 3 the output of energy from the sun tends to wax and wane on an 11year cycle but the sun entered a prolonged lull around the turn of the millennium the natural 11year cycle is currently approaching its peak but thus far it has been the weakest solar maximum in a century this could help to explain both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the model simulations which include a higher solar output than earth has experienced since 2000 an unexpected increase in the number of stratospheric aerosol particles could be another factor keeping earth cooler than predicted these particles reflect sunlight back into space and scientists suspect that small volcanoes — and perhaps even industrialization in china — could have pumped extra aerosols into the stratosphere during the past 16 years depressing global temperatures some have argued that these two factors could be primary drivers of the hiatus but studies published in the past few years suggest that their effects are likely to be relatively small 4 5 trenberth for example analysed their impacts on the basis of satellite measurements of energy entering and exiting the planet and estimated that aerosols and solar activity account for just 20 of the hiatus that leaves the bulk of the hiatus to the oceans which serve as giant sponges for heat and here the spotlight falls on the equatorial pacific blowing hot and cold just before the hiatus took hold that region had turned unusually warm during the el niño of 1997–98 which fuelled extreme weather across the planet from floods in chile and california to droughts and wildfires in mexico and indonesia but it ended just as quickly as it had begun and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of el niños sister effect la niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial pacific with a vengeance more importantly the entire eastern pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day just before the hiatus took hold that region had turned unusually warm during the el niño of 1997–98 which fuelled extreme weather across the planet from floods in chile and california to droughts and wildfires in mexico and indonesia but it ended just as quickly as it had begun and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of el niños sister effect la niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial pacific with a vengeance more importantly the entire eastern pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day this variation in ocean temperature known as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo may be a crucial piece of the hiatus puzzle the cycle reverses every 15–30 years and in its positive phase the oscillation favours el niño which tends to warm the atmosphere see the fickle ocean after a couple of decades of releasing heat from the eastern and central pacific the region cools and enters the negative phase of the pdo this state tends towards la niña which brings cool waters up from the depths along the equator and tends to cool the planet researchers identified the pdo pattern in 1997 but have only recently begun to understand how it fits in with broader oceancirculation patterns and how it may help to explain the hiatus one important finding came in 2011 when a team of researchers at ncar led by gerald meehl reported that inserting a pdo pattern into global climate models causes decadescale breaks in global warming 3 oceantemperature data from the recent hiatus reveal why in a subsequent study the ncar researchers showed that more heat moved into the deep ocean after 1998 which helped to prevent the atmosphere from warming 6 in a third paper the group used computer models to document the flip side of the process when the pdo switches to its positive phase it heats up the surface ocean and atmosphere helping to drive decades of rapid warming 7 a key breakthrough came last year from shangping xie and yu kosaka at the scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla california the duo took a different tack by programming a model with actual sea surface temperatures from recent decades in the eastern equatorial pacific and then seeing what happened to the rest of the globe 8 their model not only recreated the hiatus in global temperatures but also reproduced some of the seasonal and regional climate trends that have marked the hiatus including warming in many areas and cooler northern winters it was actually a revelation for me when i saw that paper says john fyfe a climate modeller at the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis in victoria but it did not he adds explain everything what it skirted was the question of what is driving the tropical cooling",

system and therefore that long term prediction of future climate states is not possible the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc third assessment report 2001 section 14222 p 774 emphasis added the above sentence went missing from subsequent ipcc reports apparently it was once part of the consensus though even though it has disappeared it nevertheless inadvertently blurted out the truth a famous climategate email dialog follows below dr phil jones – cru emails – 5th july 2005 the scientific community would come down on me in no uncertain terms if i said the world had cooled from 1998 ok it has but it is only 7 years of data and it isnt statistically significant dr phil jones – cru emails – 7th may 2009 bottom line the no upward trend has to continue for a total of 15 years before we get worried dr kevin trenberth – cru emails – 2009 the fact is we cant account for the lack of global warming at the moment and it is a travesty we cant well it has been more than 15 years of no warming now time to get worried you betcha a new paper by the above mentioned dr trenberth acknowledges the importance of the socalled pacific decadal oscillation in determining relatively short term warming and cooling cycles short term meaning decades in this case but the socalled skeptics have pointed to this for a very long time more about the paper can be found here the pacific decadal oscillation keep in mind that in the mid 1970s the scientific consensus was worried about global cooling and an imminent new ice age – click to enlarge a recent article in nature discusses the case of the missing heat and what progress is being made in explaining away the fact that none of the models predicting global warming by co2 forcing can account for the observed reality as a reminder here is the difference between the model predictions and what has actually happened the predictions of hansens climate model presented to the us congress in 1988 versus the reality source climatesensenorpag – click to enlarge however instead of simply admitting that the models may be wrong the heat is held to be hiding out in the oceans it is apparently widely hoped that it will return in time to save careers and grants from nature now as the globalwarming hiatus enters its sixteenth year scientists are at last making headway in the case of the missing heat some have pointed to the sun volcanoes and even pollution from china as potential culprits but recent studies suggest that the oceans are key to explaining the anomaly the latest suspect is the el niño of 1997–98 which pumped prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere — perhaps enough to tip the equatorial pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since the 1997 to 98 el niño event was a trigger for the changes in the pacific and i think thats very probably the beginning of the hiatus says kevin trenberth a climate scientist at the national center for atmospheric research ncar in boulder colorado according to this theory the tropical pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming years eventually trenberth says it will switch back in the other direction translation please dear lord let it switch back as soon as possible or the warming check is in the mail that is however perhaps less likely than thought see further below why if one looks at the chart of the pdo above a common sense question immediately springs to mind why was the warming trend prior to 1940 almost identical to that between 1976 and 1998 when obviously co2 emissions at the time can not have been a major factor this is not explained anywhere could it be that natural climate variability is actually the major factor in driving both warming and cooling phases and that co2 emissions by humans are in fact a negligible input interesting is also the following comment by another climate researcher cited in the nature article none of the climate simulations carried out for the ipcc produced this particular hiatus at this particular time that has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared others say that this conclusion goes against the longterm temperature trends as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past and many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively shortterm blip in the climate if you are interested in global climate change your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years says susan solomon a climate scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge emphasis added does that mean that if there is no warming for another century their vaunted models will still not be proved wrong if that is so then the science is guaranteed to only advance one funeral at a time as the saying goes by the way the differentiation between skeptics and scientists is an insult to the many skeptics who are in fact scientists and whose ranks are set to swell in our opinion temperature anomaly vs atmospheric co2 over the past 11000 years data gathered by examination of ice cores click to enlarge several skeptics are naturally pointing out that their work is suddenly integrated into the consensus with not a word being mentioned of the ridicule and opposition they had to endure for so long for instance here are dr sebastian lüning and prof fritz vahrenholt it took a while but ocean cycles have finally been adopted by the ipcc as an important climate factor with john fasullo kevin trenberth has written in a new paper appearing in the journal earths future that the warming pause taking place since 1998 indeed may have something to do with the pacific decadal oscillation pdo also even trenberths pal stefan rahmstorf suddenly thinks its a good possibility in 2012 when we brought up the pdo as one of the triggers for the 19761998 warming in our die kalte sonne book and proposed ocean cycles as a sort of pulse generator for temperature cycles on a decadal scale we were met with fierce resistance from the german climate science establishment now less than 2 years later die kalte sonne finds itself as mainstream science they also mention an interesting comment made by julia slingo of the met office at a royal society meeting last year she was playing devils advocate the devil being all those who say the climate models are crap ie the deniers and asked a well known alarmist a question he ultimately couldnt answer at a royal society meeting in 2013 julia slingo of the met office played devils advocate and posed the following question to prof jochen marotzke of the german max planck institute of meteorology see the 4246 mark royalsocietyorgmarotzkemp3 it s a great presentation about 15 years being irrelevant but i think some of us might say if you look at the pacific decadal oscillation and it s timescale that it appears to work it could be 30 years and therefore i think you know we are still not out of the woods yet on this one if you do think it s internal variability and you say we do think the pacific decadal oscillation is a key component of this and it s now in it s particular phase but was previously in the opposite phase could you not therefore explain the accelerated warming of the 80s and 90s as being driven by the other phase of natural variability simplifying slingos incoherence if the current cooling is due to the negative pdo phase then wouldn t the warming of the 80s and 90s be a result of the positive pdo phase back then marotzke answers after much incoherence of his own um i guess i m not sure these people make no sense at all they are sure its the oceans cold phase gobbling up heat when temperatures fail to rise but when temperatures increase they just cant be sure that the oceans are involved at all and insist they would not bet much money on it of course it just cant work only one way marotzke is delivering only what would call unadulterated absurd science emphasis added to ms slingos query what does were not out of the woods really mean that they are scared they have exaggerated and are as one commentator at anthony watts site remarked in need of an exit strategy the problem of modeling the future of a complex system the big problem is that the climate models that are at the root of the catastrophic anthropogenic global warming forecasts are trying to do something that is literally impossible below is a video of a presentation by christopher essex professor and associate chair in the department of applied mathematics at the university of western ontario and former director of its theoretical physics program now one thing we can expect professor essex to know a thing or two about are the mathematics behind the modeling and this is what the presentation focuses on it is done in a way that makes it possible even for a layperson to easily discern what the problems of these models are and that in fact these problems are insurmountable at least at present as an aside professor essex is of course both a skeptic and a scientist and he is far from alone for instance we would like to point readers to a 2009 paper he coauthored with eight other scholars and which has been reviewed by 50 others entitled critical topics in global warming the introduction tells us a little bit about the socalled consensus the issue of global warming is the subject of two parallel debates one scientific focused on the analyses of complex and conflicting data the other political addressing what is the proper response of government to a hypothetical risk proponents of an immediate and sweeping regulatory response insist that the scientific debate has long been settled but a fair reading of the science as presented in the fraser institutes independent summary for policymakers ispm proves otherwise the supplements to that report go deeper into some of the key topics and provide even more evidence that popularized notions about the causes and consequences of global warming are more fiction than fact when looking at the presentation below it becomes crystal clear why the science especially with regard to climate models simply can not be regarded as settled believing 6 impossible things before breakfast and climate modeling by christopher essex the quiet sun now a few remarks on why the missing heat may well go on missing for a good while yet below is an excerpt from a recent article published by the bcc regarding the activity of the sun which has declined to its lowest in at least a century scientists are baffled by this behavior – something highly unusual is evidently happening ive been a solar physicist for 30 years and ive never seen anything quite like this says richard harrison head of space physics at the rutherford appleton laboratory in oxfordshire he shows me recent footage captured by spacecraft that have their sights trained on our star the sun is revealed in exquisite detail but its face is strangely featureless if you want to go back to see when the sun was this inactive youve got to go back about 100 years he says this solar lull is baffling scientists because right now the sun should be awash with activity it has reached its solar maximum the point in its 11year cycle where activity is at a peak this giant ball of plasma should be peppered with sunspots exploding with flares and spewing out huge clouds of charged particles into space in the form of coronal mass ejections but apart from the odd event like some recent solar flares it has been very quiet and this damp squib of a maximum follows a solar minimum – the period when the suns activity troughs – that was longer and lower than scientists expected its completely taken me and many other solar scientists by surprise says dr lucie green from university college londons mullard space science laboratory the drop off in activity is happening surprisingly quickly and scientists are now watching closely to see if it will continue to plummet it could mean a very very inactive star it would feel like the sun is asleep a very dormant ball of gas at the centre of our solar system explains dr green this though would certainly not be the first time this has happened during the latter half of the 17th century the sun went through an extremely quiet phase – a period called the maunder minimum historical records reveal that sunspots virtually disappeared during this time dr green says there is a very strong hint that the sun is acting in the same way now as it did in the runup to the maunder minimum mike lockwood professor of space environment physics from the university of reading thinks there is a significant chance that the sun could become increasingly quiet an analysis of icecores which hold a longterm record of solar activity suggests the decline in activity is the fastest that has been seen in 10000 years its an unusually rapid decline explains prof lockwood we estimate that within about 40 years or so there is a 10 to 20 – nearer 20 – probability that well be back in maunder minimum conditions the era of solar inactivity in the 17th century coincided with a period of bitterly cold winters in europe londoners enjoyed frost fairs on the thames after it froze over snow cover across the continent increased the baltic sea iced over – the conditions were so harsh some describe it as a miniice age emphasis added the article naturally goes on to point out that according to the ipcc the effect of co2 emissions tops every other influence on the climate no wonder as co2 emissions can be taxed try taxing the sun although the odd men out who think the sun is far more important are mentioned in passing but not to worry at worst we will miss the polar lights henceforth somehow this doesnt feel very reassuring – after all if the maunder minimum was irrelevant to the climate then why was there a little ice age admittedly it remains an open question how important the suns activity is to the climate – after all if a complex system like the earths climate can not be successfully modeled this holds for the past as well as for the future it is not possible to state apodictically that the maunder minimum produced the little ice age intuitively though we tend to think that the sun is indeed an important factor on a geological time scale the last major ice age happened only a very short time ago and we know that there have been vast variations in average temperatures over large time scales in fact it is only because we live in a warming cycle on these large time scales an interglacial period that human civilization as we know it exists at all try to imagine feeding more than 7 billion people with the planet a full 8 to 10 degrees celsius colder and with a large part of its landmass covered in ice of course that is certainly not an imminent problem but looking at the regularity with which glacial and interglacial periods occur it seems obvious that it will become a problem one day we happen to think that even a mini ice age could be quite a nuisance it would definitely make life a lot more uncomfortable in the northern hemisphere currently there is no certainty what precisely the main cause of ice ages is but cycles related to the sun specifically the milankovitch cycles which describe changes in earths orbit around the sun are undoubtedly playing a role temperatures plus co2 and dust concentration in the atmosphere over the past 400000 odd years via the vostok ice core data and yes co2 tends to follow temperature it doesnt lead presumably there are feedback loops at work though with higher co2 concentration and temperature reinforcing each other during the up and downswings click to enlarge what is slightly worrisome about the above chart is that the very cold periods tend to have a much longer duration than the warm periods which seem to have a tendency to produce shortlived spike highs in fact the behavior of the long term temperature chart looks very similar to the price charts of a number of commodities conclusion the backtracking has begun – as a first step climate skeptics see their work suddenly integrated into the mainstream however we are not yet at the point where the models are rejected or the greenhouse gascentric agw theory is truly abandoned instead were now in the how can we keep saying we are right while were obviously wrong phase a lot is at stake after all scientific reputations but most importantly a lot of money policymakers dont want to hear that there is no problem because that would close off a major source of tax revenues as well as what is currently a major avenue for crony capitalism and pork barrel spending through the subsidization of uneconomic green energy schemes entire vast bureaucracies depend on agw as well and there is no alternative promotion in sight yet that could replace this sheer inexhaustible and vast fount of tax payer funded nonactivity so now the hope is that the heat is hiding out deep in the oceans and ready to return at the drop of a hat or rather a turn of the trade winds that may however not happen what then",

climate agencies eg the uk met office papers forecasting when the pause will end and — the subject of this post — papers about possible causes of the pause whats more pitiful activists attempts to

exciting frontier of climate science this is not a comprehensive bibliography nor does it attempt to list all the major papers in each of these areas 2 surveys of the literature here are survey papers reviewing the current state of the various explanations of the pause a the recent pause in global warming what are the potential causes uk met office july 2013 — this is one of a large 3part paper series by this major climate agency excerpt there are two main ways to explain the recent surface temperature behaviour firstly through changes in the net amount of incoming energy to the climate system radiative forcing or secondly through redistribution of energy within the climate system particularly through exchange between the upper and deep ocean which can temporarily hide the warming below the surface both explanations have been put forward in the literature for instance several studies eg solomon et al 2010 2011 church et al 2011 have considered potential radiative forcing explanations while others eg knight et al 2009 meehl et al 2011 katsman and van oldenborgh 2011 have examined the potential ocean heat redistribution b heat hide and seek lisa goddard nature climate change march 2014 — natural variability can explain fluctuations in surface temperatures but can it account for the current slowdown in warming c reconciling warming trends gavin a schmidt et al nature geoscience march 2014 — abstract climate models projected stronger warming over the past 15 years than has been seen in observations conspiring factors of errors in volcanic and solar inputs representations of aerosols and el niño evolution may explain most of the discrepancy conclusion red emphasis added we conclude that use of the latest information on external influences on the climate system and adjusting for internal variability associated with enso can almost completely reconcile the trends in global mean surface temperature in cmip5 models and observations nevertheless attributing climate trends over relatively short periods such as 10 to 15 years will always be problematic and it is inherently unsatisfying to find model–data agreement only with the benefit of hindsight we see no indication however that transient climate response is systematically overestimated in the cmip5 climate models as has been speculated or that decadal variability across the ensemble of models is systematically underestimated although at least some individual models probably fall short in this respect most importantly our analysis implies that significant warming trends are likely to resume because the dominant longterm warming effect of wellmixed greenhouse gases continues to rise asian pollution levels are likely to stabilize and perhaps decrease although lower solar activity may persist and volcanic eruptions are unpredictable enso will eventually move back into a positive phase and the simultaneous coincidence of multiple cooling effects will cease further warming is very likely to be the result 3 its the reduced level of water vapor in the atmosphere contributions of stratospheric water vapor to decadal changes in the rate of global warming susan solomon et al science 5 march 2010 — gated open copy here abstract stratospheric water vapor concentrations decreased by about 10 after the year 2000 here we show that this acted to slow the rate of increase in global surface temperature over 2000–2009 by about 25 compared to that which would have occurred due only to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases more limited data suggest that stratospheric water vapor probably increased between 1980 and 2000 which would have enhanced the decadal rate of surface warming during the 1990s by about 30 as compared to estimates neglecting this change these findings show that stratospheric water vapor is an important driver of decadal global surface climate change excerpt over the past century global average surface temperatures have warmed by about 075°c much of the warming occurred in the past halfcentury over which the average decadal rate of change was about 013°c largely due to anthropogenic increases in wellmixed greenhouse gases however the trend in global surface temperatures has been nearly flat since the late 1990s despite continuing increases in the forcing due to the sum of the wellmixed greenhouse gases co2 ch4 halocarbons and n2o raising questions regarding the understanding of forced climate change its drivers the parameters that define natural internal variability and how fully these terms are represented in climate models figure 3 thus shows that the decline in stratospheric water vapor after 2000 should be expected to have significantly contributed to the flattening of the global warming trend in the past decade and stratospheric water increases may also have acted to steepen the observed warming trend in the 1990s 4 its natural variability a reconciling anthropogenic climate change with observed temperature 1998–2008 robert k kaufmann heikki kauppi michael l mann and james h stock proceedings of the national academy of sciences pnas 11 july 2011 — abstract given the widely noted increase in the warming effects of rising greenhouse gas concentrations it has been unclear why global surface temperatures did not rise between 1998 and 2008 we find that this hiatus in warming coincides with a period of little increase in the sum of anthropogenic and natural forcings declining solar insolation as part of a normal elevenyear cycle and a cyclical change from an el nino to a la nina dominate our measure of anthropogenic effects because rapid growth in shortlived sulfur emissions partially offsets rising greenhouse gas concentrations as such we find that recent global temperature records are consistent with the existing understanding of the relationship among global surface temperature internal variability and radiative forcing which includes anthropogenic factors with well known warming and cooling effects b return periods of global climate fluctuations and the pause shaun lovejoy geophysical research letters in press — open copy here abstract an approach complementary to general circulation models gcms using the anthropogenic co2 radiative forcing as a linear surrogate for all anthropogenic forcings was recently developed for quantifying human impacts using preindustrial multiproxy series and scaling arguments the probabilities of natural fluctuations at time lags up to 125 years were determined the hypothesis that the industrial epoch warming was a giant natural fluctuation was rejected with 999 confidence in this paper this method is extended to the determination of event return times over the period 1880–2013 the largest 32 year event is expected to be 047 k effectively explaining the postwar cooling amplitude 042–047 k similarly the pause since 1998 028–037 k has a return period of 20–50 years not so unusual it is nearly cancelled by the prepause warming event 1992–1998 return period 30–40 years the pause is no more than natural variability 5 more aerosols eg burn more coal a see 4a above rapid growth in shortlived sulfur emissions partially offsets rising greenhouse gas concentrations b contrary analysis climate impacts of changing aerosol emissions since 1996 t kuhn et al geophysical research letters in press — gated abstract red emphasis added increases in asian aerosol emissions have been suggested as one possible reason for the hiatus in global temperature increase during the past 15 years we study the effect of sulphur and black carbon bc emission changes between 1996 and 2010 on the global energy balance we find that the increased asian emissions have had very little regional or global effects while the emission reductions in europe and the us have caused a positive radiative forcing in our simulations the globalmean aerosol direct radiative effect changes by 006 wm2 during 1996 to 2010 while the effective radiative forcing erf is 042 wm2 the rather large erf arises mainly from changes in cloudiness especially in europe in asia the bc warming due to sunlight absorption has largely offset the cooling caused by sulphate aerosols asian bc concentrations have increased by a nearly constant fraction at all altitudes and thus they warm the atmosphere also in cloudy conditions 6 its the volcanoes a recent anthropogenic increases in so2 from asia have minimal impact on stratospheric aerosol ryan neely et al geophysical research letters 13 march 2013 — pdf of slide presentation abstract observations suggest that the optical depth of the stratospheric aerosol layer between 20 and 30 km has increased 4–10 per year since 2000 which is significant for earths climate contributions to this increase both from moderate volcanic eruptions and from enhanced coal burning in asia have been suggested current observations are insufficient to attribute the contribution of the different sources here we use a global climate model coupled to an aerosol microphysical model to partition the contribution of each we employ model runs that include the increases in anthropogenic sulfur dioxide so2 over asia and the moderate volcanic explosive injections of so2 observed from 2000 to 2010 comparison of the model results to observations reveals that moderate volcanic eruptions rather than anthropogenic influences are the primary source of the observed increases in stratospheric aerosol b volcanic contribution to decadal changes in tropospheric temperature benjamin d santer et al nature geoscience march 2014 — gated abstract despite continued growth in atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases global mean surface and tropospheric temperatures have shown slower warming since 1998 than previously possible explanations for the slowdown include internal climate variability external cooling influences and observational errors several recent modelling studies have examined the contribution of early twentyfirstcentury volcanic eruptions to the muted surface warming here we present a detailed analysis of the impact of recent volcanic forcing on tropospheric temperature based on observations as well as climate model simulations we identify statistically significant correlations between observations of stratospheric aerosol optical depth and satellitebased estimates of both tropospheric temperature and shortwave fluxes at the top of the atmosphere we show that climate model simulations without the effects of early twentyfirstcentury volcanic eruptions overestimate the tropospheric warming observed since 1998 in two simulations with more realistic volcanic influences following the 1991 pinatubo eruption differences between simulated and observed tropospheric temperature trends over the period 1998 to 2012 are up to 15 smaller with large uncertainties in the magnitude of the effect to reduce these uncertainties better observations of eruptionspecific properties of volcanic aerosols are needed as well as improved representation of these eruptionspecific properties in climate model simulations 7 the oceans are absorbing the heat the eminent roger pielke sr see wikipedia has long said that the focus on the surface air temperature was inappropriate and that the spatial pattern of ocean heat content change is the appropriate metric to assess climate system heat changes including global warming source for this he was smeared and called a denier by activists such as those at skeptical science dana nuccitellis launch pad which should be called skeptical of science see this page calling him a climate misinformer note that all of his quotes shown there now appear correct see this note for a more detail and references to his work now that the surface temperature has paused climate scientists have realized that he was correct and of course activists give no retraction or apologies for their smears now back to the scientists a an apparent hiatus in global warming kevin e trenberth and john t fasullo earths future 5 december 2013 — also see trenberths has global warming stalled at the conversation 23 may 2014 abstract global warming first became evident beyond the bounds of natural variability in the 1970s but increases in global mean surface temperatures have stalled in the 2000s increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases notably carbon dioxide create an energy imbalance at the topofatmosphere toa even as the planet warms to adjust to this imbalance which is estimated to be 05–1 w m−2 over the 2000s annual global fluctuations in toa energy of up to 02 w m−2 occur from natural variations in clouds aerosols and changes in the sun at times of major volcanic eruptions the effects can be much larger yet global mean surface temperatures fluctuate much more than these can account for an energy imbalance is manifested not just as surface atmospheric or ground warming but also as melting sea and land ice and heating of the oceans more than 90 of the heat goes into the oceans and with melting land ice causes sea level to rise for the past decade more than 30 of the heat has apparently penetrated below 700 m depth that is traceable to changes in surface winds mainly over the pacific in association with a switch to a negative phase of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo in 1999 surface warming was much more in evidence during the 1976–1998 positive phase of the pdo suggesting that natural decadal variability modulates the rate of change of global surface temperatures while sealevel rise is more relentless global warming has not stopped it is merely manifested in different ways b sixteen years into the mysterious globalwarming hiatus scientists are piecing together an explanation jeff tollefson nature 15 january 2014 — wellwritten news feature not peerreviewed research opening the biggest mystery in climate science today may have begun unbeknownst to anybody at the time with a subtle weakening of the tropical trade winds blowing across the pacific ocean in late 1997 these winds normally push sunbaked water towards indonesia when they slackened the warm water sloshed back towards south america resulting in a spectacular example of a phenomenon known as el niño average global temperatures hit a record high in 1998 — and then the warming stalled now as the globalwarming hiatus enters its 16th year scientists are at last making headway in the case of the missing heat some have pointed to the sun volcanoes and even pollution from china as potential culprits but recent studies suggest that the oceans are key to explaining the anomaly the latest suspect is the el niño of 1997–98 which pumped prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere — perhaps enough to tip the equatorial pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since this is a remarkable article

large uncertainties in measurements of the ocean heat content e bidecadal thermal changes in the abyssal ocean carl wunsch and patrick heimbach journal of physical oceanography in press — open copy here one of his conclusions red emphasis added the globally integrated heat content changes involve small dierences of the much larger regional changes as existing estimates of the anthropogenic forcing are now about 05wm2 the equivalent global ocean average temperature changes over 20 years are mostly slight compared to the shorter term temporal variations from numerous physical sources detailed attention must be paid to what might otherwise appear to be small errors in data calibration and spacetime sampling and model biases direct determination of changes in oceanic heat content over the last 20 years are not in conflict with estimates of the radiative forcing but the uncertainties remain too large to rationalize eg the apparent pause in warming 8 stadium waves role for

to twentiethcentury temperature changes francisco estrada pierre perron and benjamín martínezlópez nature geoscience december 2013 — abstract the warming of the climate system is unequivocal as evidenced by an increase in global temperatures by 08 °c over the past century however the attribution of the observed warming to human activities remains less clear particularly because of the apparent slowdown in warming since the late 1990s here we analyse radiative forcing and temperature time series with stateoftheart statistical methods to address this question without climate model simulations we show that longterm trends in total radiative forcing and temperatures have largely been determined by atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and modulated by other radiative factors we identify a pronounced increase in the growth rates of both temperatures and radiative forcing around 1960 which marks the onset of sustained global warming our analyses also reveal a contribution of human interventions to two periods when global warming slowed down our statistical analysis suggests that the reduction in the emissions of ozonedepleting substances under the montreal protocol as well as a reduction in methane emissions contributed to the lower rate of warming since the 1990s furthermore we identify a contribution from the two world wars and the great depression to the documented cooling in the midtwentieth century through lower carbon dioxide emissions we conclude that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are effective in slowing the rate of warming in the short term there is a large and growing body of research on this topic here is a recent paper about the effects of the ozone climate system response to stratospheric ozone depletion and recovery michael

activity as drivers of decadal or centurylong climate cycles see research listed in section 7 here climate activists have denounced as deniers anyone daring to mention this research see the comments to the posts about solar cycles now thats gone down the memory hole as solar activity becomes an explanation for the pause weve always been at war with eastasia back to the science reduced solar activity disguises global temperature rise peter stauning atmosphere and climate sciences january 2014 – abstract the question whether human activities seriously affect climate is asked with increasing voice these days quite understandable since the climate appears to be out of control with the significant global temperature increases already seen during the last 3 decades and with still heavier temperature increases to come in the future according to prognoses among others in the recent comprehensive ipcc reports however the most recent climate data show global temperature development levelling off or even turning negative since 2001 in contrast to the anticipated course related to the steady increases in the concentration in the atmosphere of greenhouse gasses primarily carbon dioxide and methane the purpose of this communication is to demonstrate that the reduced rate in the global temperature rise complies with expectations related to the decaying level of solar activity according to the relation published in an earlier analysis without the reduction in the solar activityrelated contributions the global temperatures would have increased steadily from 1980 to present 11 one of the 4 major global temperature datasets underestimates warming doubting the accuracy of global temperature measurements has been considered heresy by climate activists denier denier theyd cry but desperate for salvation they greeted this paper with euphoric celebration although much of the initial response by climate scientists was critical examples here plus of course there are three other major temperature datasets coverage bias in the hadcrut4 temperature series and its impact on recent temperature trends kevin cowtan and robert g way quarterly journal of the royal meteorology society in press — abstract in complete global coverage is a potential source of bias in global temperature reconstructions if the unsampled regions are not uniformly distributed over the planets surface the widely used hadcrut4 dataset covers on average about 84 of the globe over recent decades with the unsampled regions being concentrated at the poles and over africa three existing reconstructions with nearglobal coverage are examined each suggesting that hadcrut4 is subject to bias due to its treatment of unobserved regions two alternative approaches for reconstructing global temperatures are explored one based on an optimal interpolation algorithm and the other a hybrid method incorporating additional information from the satellite temperature record the methods are validated on the basis of their skill at reconstructing omitted sets of observations both methods provide superior results than excluding the unsampled regions with the hybrid method showing particular skill around the regions where no observations are available temperature trends are compared for the hybrid global temperature reconstruction and the raw hadcrut4 data the widely quoted trend since 1997 in the hybrid global reconstruction is two and a half times greater than the corresponding trend in the coveragebiased hadcrut4 data coverage bias causes a cool bias in recent temperatures relative to the late 1990s which increases from around 1998 to the present trends starting in 1997 or 1998 are particularly biased with respect to the global trend the issue is exacerbated by the strong el ni ̃no event of 19971998 which also tends to suppress trends starting during those years 12 the trade winds have changed a recent intensification of winddriven circulation in the pacific and the ongoing warming hiatus matthew h england et al nature climate change march 2014 — gated abstract despite ongoing increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases the earths global average surface air temperature has remained more or less steady since 2001 a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for this slowdown in surface warming a key component of the global hiatus that has been identified is cool eastern pacific sea surface temperature but it is unclear how the ocean has remained relatively cool there in spite of ongoing increases in radiative forcing here we show that a pronounced strengthening in pacific trade winds over the past two decades — unprecedented in observationsreanalysis data and not captured by climate models — is sufficient to account for the cooling of the tropical pacific and a substantial slowdown in surface warming through increased subsurface ocean heat uptake the extra uptake has come about through increased subduction in the pacific shallow overturning cells enhancing heat convergence in the equatorial thermocline at the same time the accelerated trade winds have increased equatorial upwelling in the central and eastern pacific lowering sea surface temperature there which drives further cooling in other regions the net effect of these anomalous winds is a cooling in the 2012 global average surface air temperature of 01–02 °c which can account for much of the hiatus in surface warming observed since 2001 this hiatus could persist for much of the present decade if the trade wind trends continue however rapid warming is expected to resume once the anomalous wind trends abate their work is part of the ongoing shift of climate scientists expectations away from the forecasts of extreme warming

about global warming while cheering for their faction of scientists laypeople often lose sight of the big picture — the key elements for making public policy about this important issue a the work of

causes of past warming — which probably varied over time — between natural drivers eg rebound from the little ice age solar influences and anthropogenic drivers eg co2 aerosols land use changes other

the most important research of the decade 17 january 2014 d warming of the surface atmosphere paused sometime during 19982000 still good news global temperatures remain stable at least for now 14

            "text": "Scientists explore causes of the pause in warming, perhaps the most important research of the decade\n\nSummary:  Today we look at papers exploring the pause in warming of the surface atmosphere temperature, now in its second decade. This is one of the world’s most important science priorities, which will guide public policy for the next decade. Do we need a crash program to control CO2 emissions, and mitigate the effects of warming. Or do we have time for more measured responses?  There is another dimension to this. Climate science not only teaches us much about our planet, but the reactions of political activists on both says much about modern America.\n\nContent\n\nResearch into the causes of the pause in surface temperature warming is some of the most important science being done today. We will gain not only vital information about our world, but also — if we look — insights about ourselves that can help us become a more effective society.\n\n(a)  Learning about our world\n\nThe results of this research might determine public policy priorities for the next decade or more. Do we have time for measured responses to rising CO2 levels, or are crash programs required now to limit them — and prepare for the effects of resumed warming?\n\nHere are some samples of papers about possible causes of the pause. These are all speculative (science takes place on the edges of available data and theory). Eventually these lines of research will produce answers. Meanwhile we get to watch science in action.\n\n(b)  Learning about ourselves\n\nAmerican society has long been famously anti-intellectual. The Right cherishes creationists; the Left loves the Pope when he supports their views (He’s a superstitious old reactionary the rest of the time). The climate wars demonstrates that this remains true today.\n\nNow we see the climate activists in full madness. They loudly declare that there is no pause in surface temperature warming. This ignores the dozens of papers mentioning the pause, reports by major climate agencies (e.g., the UK Met Office), papers forecasting when the pause will end, and — the subject of this post — papers about possible causes of the pause.\n\nWhat’s more pitiful? Activists attempts to conceal the work of climate scientists? Or their followers who close their eyes, seeing only what they’re told to see (a modern version of the prisoners in Plato’s cave).\n\nNow — onto the science. This is a brief summary of research conducted about climate by scientists in many fields. Shown in chronological order.  This will be updated as new papers appear. These are given as examples of work on this exciting frontier of climate science.

Follow @tudorvieru The mismatch between predictions and recorded value allowed climate change skeptics some wiggle room, and made them bolder in declaring that humans are not influencing global warming. The inability to explain why the trend was abating reduced the credibility of climate sciences somewhat.At first, researchers believed that the data they have collected since 1998 contains a lot of noise, a statistics term for lack of resolution and accuracy. Another explanation was that natural variations were causing temperatures to drop below expected levels. The new study shows that was not the case.In order to prevent any confusion, it is worth nothing here that average atmospheric temperatures continued to increase beyond 1998. The issue is that they did so slower than researchers predicted.While skeptics were busy pointing out the absence of explanations for this phenomenon, climatologists were searching for the location or systems where the missing heat continued to accumulate. Experts knew that the extra heat did not disappear, but rather hid somewhere.In a flood of new studies, the heat was revealed to have been hidden by the Sun, volcanic eruptions, or particulate emissions from China. However, the new investigation shows that the world's oceans are the most likely culprits, storing the heat within massive reservoirs in the Pacific Ocean and elsewhere.The El Niño atmospheric oscillation that occurred between 1997 and 1998 is believed to have pumped massive amounts of heat out of the equatorial portions of the Pacific Ocean into the atmosphere.

After all, \"scientists\" are wrong about evolution, why shouldn't they be wrong about global warming, too? \n\n \n\n In other words, it doesn't matter. There is no way to sway climate change deniers, because they believe that global warming is not real in the same way that some religious fundamentalists believe that the planet is 6,000 years old. No amount of science, reason, or evidence will change their minds, yet even still deniers will claim that *they* are the ones with the real science...\n\n \n\n It really isn't a shock...the rich have always put their own interests before the interests of the poor, and it is the poor that will suffer due to global warming.

            "body": "hotwhopper pausing for curry a note on her hiatus judith curry is going great guns diving into denial territory yesterday i wrote about her appalling testimony to the us senate committee about the ipcc report and implied it may be preferable to modify the climate by continuing to add co2 rather than reduce it today shes writing about an article in nature by jeff tollefson archived here ive written about the nature article already when anthony watts wrote about it in her blog article on the subject judith starts with a reference to tabloid journalist david rose writing i told you so eighteen months ago in october 2012 david rose was trying to claim that global warming stopped sixteen years ago or 17 years ago now is judith trying to claim the same thing she wrote jc comment my my recall david roses article in oct 2012 on the pause claiming that global warming had stopped and the pushback against roses article the pause has now gone mainstream with this article in nature even in the ipcc did its level best to downplay it david rose put up a monthly chart going which he said went back to the beginning of 1997 and claimed that global warming stopped sixteen years earlier why he didnt put up annual temperatures back to and including 1996 is obvious even just looking at surface temperatures noone in their right mind would claim that the land and ocean surface temperature has not risen since 1996 and they certainly couldnt claim that global warming stopped in 1996 claiming no warming since 1997 is a big stretch too judith writes more about the pause saying now no one understands the cause of the pause but climate scientists say the heat is hiding in the ocean my next post will be on ocean heat content so im not getting into this here the competing explanation the denier one i guess since i dont hear mainstream climate scientists mentioning this is that the heat never made it into the system possibly related to changing cloud patterns or properties that reflected more solar radiation size matters here ie the length of the hiatus depending on when you start counting this hiatus has lasted 16 years climate model simulations find that the probability of a hiatus as long as 20 years is vanishingly small if the 20 year threshold is reached for the pause this will lead inescapably to the conclusion that the climate model sensitivity to co2 is too large further 20 years is approaching the length of the warming period from 19762000 that is the main smoking gun for agw depending on when you start counting indeed david roses 16 years dated back from august 2012 according to him judith is saying depending on when you start counting sixteen years ago doesnt depend on when you start counting its obvious that you start counting from now if you are going to claim that this hiatus has lasted 16 years you are saying it started in december 1997 during the superel nino anyway heres a chart showing the global surface temperature anomaly ive marked david roses sixteen years from the end of 2012 to the year ended 1996 judiths sixteen years from the end of 2013 to the year ended 1997 and also highlighted 1998 which will be sixteen years before the end of 2014 looking at the above if you were into pattern recognition you might be tempted to postulate that the hiatus could last as long as the one from 1940 to 1970 that is until the 2030s as judith suggests see below i guess youd have to rely on only a single cycle of the pattern anyway if that were to happen one would probably also postulate that then thered be another huge rapid rise in surface temperatures and that by 2060 surface temperatures could be another 06 degrees or more higher than now or a rise of 14 to 18 degrees above temperatures of the early twentieth century it would be getting mighty hot by the 2060s not that im suggesting you rely on pattern recognition i prefer the climate model approach and how hot it gets will all come down to how much more co2 we put in the air over the next few years and decades to get back on track with judiths latest article next she seems to be complaining that jeff tollefson used the word skeptics writing rather scary that nature does not seem to acknowledge that skepticism is one of the norms of science and regards skeptics and scientists are mutually exclusive groups i agree that he should have made it clear what he meant i presume he meant fake skeptics not skeptics when he wrote this has led skeptics – and some scientists and he should have made that quite clear i dont disagree with the sentiment when judith writes that people are interested in climate change on all sorts of time scales including decadal especially since climates are changing so quickly now with all the extra greenhouse gases we are adding not that we can tell much over only say ten or twenty years although climates can change quite a lot in fits and starts so while i agree what people are interested in id argue that on a decadal time scale its hard to identify a change in climate in australia we have big extremes of climate going from drought to floods but these are all features of the same climate in southeastern australia we generally have excessive heat and drought with el nino and colder weather and floods with la nina climate shifts dont become apparent on a decadal timescale you need a multidecadal time scale for that for example compare the climate here of the 2000s with the climate of the 1950s and youll notice quite a difference anyway when judith writes solomon should have stated that if you are interested in the climate response to a longterm secular buildup of greenhouse gases then your main focus should be timescales of 50100 years i agree with this and if you look at the last 100 years you have that other inconvenient pause to explain 19401975 with the reduction in sensitivity to aerosol forcing the aerosol explanation for this earlier pause no longer holds up stadium wave dynamics can explain both the 19401975 and the current hiatus a further inference is that warming of 19762000 was enhanced by natural climate variability she sounds just like one of those fake sceptics she referred to earlier a denier with her use of the term inconvenient pause still im interested in what is the current explanation for the variations in global surface temperature over the twentieth century i went to the latest ipcc report and found nothing so judith might have a point its as if that period of flat temperatures is considered inconsequential but then the ar5 ipcc report is very long and its hard to know what search terms to use and reading the text looking for a clue makes my eyes glaze over anyway if someone knows of any recent papers on the subject can you let me know as i recall most of the midcentury hiatus is put down to aerosols and decadal ocean variations eg the pdo was negative there wasnt nearly as much co2 in the air in the middle of last century and clean air regulations came into effect in most industrialised nations in the late 1960s and early 1970s so the aerosols diminished a great deal coincidentally with temperatures and co2 emissions taking off at a great pace one thing judith writes after quoting from tollefsons article is this variation in ocean temperature known as the pacific decadal oscillation pdo may be a crucial piece of the hiatus puzzle jc comment i certainly agree that the pdo is probably a crucial piece of the puzzle but one of the quickest ways to get labeled as a denier has been to argue that the pdo in its warm phase contributed to the 19762000 warming for a climate scientist judith should know better as a science contrarian she should be more familiar with denier arguments the typical argument is not that the pdo contributed to the warming its that it caused the warming deniers generally dont accept that the world is warming or for those that do they argue its all natural or mostly natural ive written an article about a typical denier opinion about the pdo its sarcasm rather than science so youll have to read between the lines what that particular denier was arguing was that the pdo caused the post1970s warming if that were the case with the pdo being negative earth should have cooled in the mid80s for a bit and by now should be now be in a post2006 cooling in fact if the pdo caused global warming right now the surface temperature should be back to that of the midtwentieth century and thats if you only consider the period from the 1940s heres a chart to illustrate to get around the problem of why surface temperatures are still rising despite a negative pdo the denier in question argued that there was a lag in the effect of the pdo which is nonsense if there were a lag now why wasnt there a lag in the past but the deniers argument had a more fundamental flaw than that the pdo is baked in to the global surface temperature its an index of sea surface temperatures in the pacific north of 20 degrees so it cant be separated out and treated as if its an external forcing its not its a measure of natural variation in the sea surface temperatures any change in the pdo is incorporated into global surface temperatures the fact that judith isnt familiar with denier memes is somewhat surprising most people who congregate at her blog are fake sceptics maybe she doesnt read their stuff or maybe they havent covered that particular meme on her blog anyway if youre reading this judith youll now know why people get put in the fake sceptic camp when they talk of laggy pdos causing global warming this next bit from judith will make you laugh or grimace she again quotes jeff tollefson and comments you cant keep piling up warm water in the western pacific trenberth says at some point the water will get so high that it just sloshes back and when that happens if scientists are on the right track the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again jc comment well that is an interesting forecast if this is natural internal variability eg the stadium wave which includes the pdo then you would expect warming to resume at some point ive argued this might be in the 2030′s this would make the hiatus 30 years similar in length to the pevious hiatus from 1940 to 1975 this is long enough to invalidate the utility of the current climate models for projecting future climate change i dont know what judith is referring to when she says interesting forecast in inverted commas enso is now well accepted in climate science and has been for quite some time el ninos release a lot of heat from the oceans up into the atmosphere and raise the surface temperature for judith to describe a selfevident statement about the next el nino as interesting is interesting itself judith also refers to the stadium wave last october judith made a big fanfare out of the 2013 paper preprint here on the stadium wave and seems to want to take the credit for the idea however as far as i can see the idea dates back to at least 2010 i believe the first paper to mention it was this 2012 paper by marcia glaze wyatt sergey kravtsov anastasios a tsonis but there may have been an earlier paper it was again referred to in this 2012 paper by wyatt and peters going back further the authors refer to it as a stadium wave in this poster displayed at the agu 2010 fall meeting the 2007 paper referenced in wyatt12 by tsonis swanson and kravtsov was about climate shifts that may have prompted the idea of the stadium wave but its about enso that is it focuses more on the pacific ocean whereas the stadium wave focuses more on the north atlantic the concept was again discussed in the 2013 paper by marcia glaze wyatt which judith coauthored judith is giving a talk about this at a conference in march if anyone is interested there has been some interest in the idea of the stadium wave but not a huge amount google scholar lists the wyatt12 as being cited 29 times and the wyatt13 as being cited twice now the stadium wave concept embraces a large section of earth and encompasses the pdo as well as the amo and various other things as described in wyatt13 its generated and sustained from something im not sure exactly what but i gather its to do with the halocline and its influence on arctic sea ice in the region of the eurasian arctic shelfsea the paper describes the propagation of the stadium wave as four distinct stages of climate regime evolution this is probably the nub of it we found that the stadiumwave signal propagates through four different stages of climate regime evolution each stage reflects a particular behavior or a particular set of subprocess interactions and at each stage activity is heightened in a particular geographic region at all stages seeds of regime reversal are embedded within the collection of subprocesses regulating the arctic freshwater balance thereby subtly and incrementally imposing curbs on the prevailing trend of sea ice coverage assuring an inevitable regime reversal years in the future in any case according to judith the stadium wave will prevent further warming until the 2030s if there is significant warming in the next twenty years i expect she or more probably marcia wyatt will revisit the stadium wave idea and either toss it or refine it ive wandered around a bit in this article largely led by judiths article its time for a closing comment why the uncertainty given judiths focus on what is not known rather than what is known in science i got curious about what new knowledge judith has contributed lately what i found was that it is remarkably little at least as lead author apart from her uncertainty monster paper she has not been lead author of any journal paper for almost eight years not since 2006 as far as i can tell from a google scholar search or by looking at her list of publications and that 2006 bams paper had the title mixing politics and science in testing the hypothesis that greenhouse warming is causing a global increase in hurricane intensity maybe she regards blogging as a better career move than trying to stay in the publications race",

Some warming has occurred in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean in the recent fortnight, due to a weakening of the trade winds. If the trade winds remain weak, more warming towards El Niño thresholds is possible.The Bureau’s ENSO Tracker remains at WATCH status. This means the chance of an El Niño developing in 2014 is at least 50%, which is double the normal likelihood of an event. Five of the eight climate models surveyed by the Bureau suggest El Niño is likely for spring. However, if El Niño were to occur, it is unlikely to be a strong event.",

            "body": "comments on the nature article climate change the case of the missing heat bob tisdale climate observations update i finished writing this post and published it at my blog climate observations about the same time that don easterbrooks post cause of the pause in global warming was published at wattsupwiththat this post includes an overview of the mistakes people make when they attempt to use the pacific decadal oscillation data as a metric for the dominant mode of variability in the pacific ocean so it contradicts easterbrooks post more detailed discussions of what the pdo data represents and what it doesnt represent can be found in the posts here here and here if you for some reason would like to argue about it on this thread please see my comments on the easterbrook thread starting here the nature article climate change the case of the missing heat by jeff tollefson has received a lot of attention at wattsupwiththat and around the blogosphere much of tollefsons article was a simplified explanation of the findings of trenberth and fasullo 2013 an apparent hiatus in global warming weve discussed that paper already see the posts trenberth and fasullo try to keep the fantasy alive and more on trenberth and fasullo 2013 an apparent hiatus in global warming anthony watts was right to call attention to tollefsons article it presented an argument and illustration that had been presented years ago by skeptics an argument and illustration that had been dismissed by global warming enthusiasts and tollefson is linking it to trenberth and fasullo one point needs to be made right from the get go as far as i could tell no one interviewed for the nature article claimed the hiatus in surface warming was not happening that article is an attempt to explain the growing differences between the model simulations and measured global average surface temperatures and the more i look at it tollefson appears a bit skeptical at times one problem with tollefsons article it only discusses the hiatus in surface temperature warming it does not address the absence of warming of the pacific ocean and north atlantic to depths of 2000 meters for the period of 2003 to 2012 see figure 1 only the south atlantic and indian oceans show warming to depth figure 1 is from the post here figure 1 manmade greenhouse gases can not select which ocean basins they decide to warm and the tollefson article unfortunately offers as much misinformation as information the first problem as noted above was the article does not address the missing heat in the depths of the pacific over the last decade and that is where the heat would have to be appearing if trenberth and fasullo 2013 were correct the second problem has to do with using pacific decadal oscillation pdo data as a metric for the strength frequency and duration of el niño and la niña events its the wrong dataset el niño and la niña events are the primary focus of the article tollefson acknowledges this with his statement and here the spotlight falls on the equatorial pacific but then he presents pacific decadal oscillation pdo data as the metric for el niños and la niñas hes likely taking his cue from trenberth and fasullo 2013 for that el niño and la niña events take place in the tropical pacific but the pacific decadal oscillation dataset is an abstract form of sea surface temperature data derived from the extratropical north pacific not the tropical pacific see figure 2 figure 2 the pdo data basically represent how closely the spatial pattern of the sea surface temperature anomalies of the north pacific north of 20n resembles the pattern created by enso events where the spatial patterns are warmer in the east and cooler in the central and western north pacific during el niños and cooler in the east and warmer in the central and western north pacific during la niñas because that spatial pattern of sea surface temperatures in the north pacific is also impacted by sea level pressures and their interrelated wind patterns the pacific decadal oscillation data are not a true representation of the frequency magnitude and duration of el niño and la niña events for more information about what the pdo represents and more importantly what it doesnt represent see the posts here here and here figure 3 the big surprise in the nature article was the illustration comparing the pacific decadal oscillation pdo data with the global surface temperatures titled the pacifics global reach ive included it as my figure 3 it compares the jisao pdo data to global surface temperature anomalies the text in the illustration clearly states during periods when the pdo index is positive and the eastern pacific is warm global temperatures have risen quickly during spells when the pdo index is negative the warming has stagnated additionally with respect to the illustration the article reads an analysis of historical data buttressed these conclusions showing that the cool phase of the pdo coincided with a few decades of cooler temperatures after the second world war see the pacifics global reach and that the warm phase lined up with the sharp spike seen in global temperatures between 1976 and 1998 ref 4 this of course strongly suggests that the warm phase of the pdo is responsible for part of the warming during the period from 1976 to 1998 if the pdo can stop the warming then the pdo had to have contributed to the warming that had been a skeptical argument for years i can recall seeing similar graphs more than 5 years ago in fact it was so popular skepticalscience wrote a post about it here back in 2008 unfortunately there are no mechanisms through which the pdo as defined by the jisao dataset can cause global surface temperatures to vary the sea surface temperatures of the north pacific north of 20n are inversely related to the pdo data those mechanisms exist in the tropical pacific and portray themselves as el niños and la niñas sea surface temperaturebased indices for the strength frequency and duration of el niños and la niñas do exist in fact trenberth and stepaniak 2001 indices of el niño evolution online edition here recommended using the sea surface temperature anomalies of the nino34 region of the equatorial pacific identified as n34 in the paper see the illustration here for the location of the nino34 region trenberth and stepaniak 2001 used the hadisst dataset with the base years of 19501979 for anomalies unfortunately trenberth and stepaniak never really provided a scientific justification for using the base years of 1950 to 1979 so we would be better off using the entire term of the data 1923 to 2013 as the base years for the nino34 sea surface temperature anomalies the nino34 sea surface temperature data are realistic index for strength frequency and duration of el niño and la niña events so lets look at the average nino34 sea surface temperature anomalies for the two warming periods and the two hiatus periods see figure 4 well use the periods defined by trenberth and fasullo 2013 the monthly time series figure 8 readily reveals the multidecadal regimes of the pdo given by the black line with positive phases from 1923 to 1942 and 1976 to 1998 and negative phases from 1943 to 1976 and after 1999 curiously the periods presented by trenberth and fasullo 2013 do not agree with those presented by tollefson in his the pacifics global reach illustration that aside my figure 4 shows that during the two warming periods of 1923 to 1942 and 1976 to 1998 the average sea surface temperature anomalies for the nino34 region were well above zero this means that el niño events dominated that period global surface temperatures should warm during those periods because the tropical pacific is releasing more heat than normal from the tropical pacific and redistributing more warm water than normal to adjacent ocean basins and during the two hiatus periods of 1943 to 1976 and 1999 to present the average nino34 sea surface temperature anomalies are below zero that of course means the tropical pacific is releasing less heat than normal and redistributing less warm water than normal to adjacent ocean basins and during those periods global surface temperatures flattened or cooled slightly figure 4 you may be asking yourself why did bob go through that exercise when it basically showed the same results as tollefsons pdo graph the nino34 data are the correct dataset to use and the pdo is not the pdo does not represent the timing strength and duration of el niño and la niña events it portrays an aftereffect of el niño and la niña events combined with the influence of the sea level pressure of the north pacific but now we have to consider that the nino34 sea surface data only capture the effects of enso on a small region of the equatorial pacific they do not represent the processes of enso or their aftereffects and in no way can nino34 sea surface temperature anomalies account for the warm water that is left over from strong el niño events which is redistributed to adjacent ocean basins in their wakes more misinformation the article states my boldface just before the hiatus took hold that region had turned unusually warm during the el niño of 1997–98 which fuelled extreme weather across the planet from floods in chile and califor­nia to droughts and wildfires in mexico and indonesia but it ended just as quickly as it had begun and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of el niños sister effect la niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial pacific with a vengeance more importantly the entire eastern pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day entire eastern pacific the pdo data do not represent the entire eastern pacific if hes thinking sea surface temperature anomalies thats also wrong there have been a number of el niño events since 1999 those el niño events occurred in 200203and 200405and 200607and 200910 as a result the average sea surface temperature anomalies of the east pacific using noaas standard base years 19712000 for their reynolds oiv2 data for the period of january 1999 to december 2013 are 006 deg c and thats a far cry from a cool state that has continued more or less to this day see figure 5 figure 5 model nonsense the article reads second many researchers have found the opposite pattern in simulations with full cli­mate models which factor in the suite of atmospheric and oceanic interac­tions beyond the equatorial pacific these tend to reveal a trend towards more el niñolike conditions as a result of global warming climate models dont simulate enso properly so this is irrelevant see guilyardi et al 2009 understanding el niño in oceanatmosphere general circulation models progress and challenges and bellenger et al 2013 enso representation in climate models from cmip3 to cmip5 preprint copy is here things overlooked the following was written for the post comments on stefan rahmstorfs post at realclimate what ocean heating reveals about global warming the discussion applies here as well ive changed the figure numbers and made a few minor revisions for this post in the lefthand graph of figure 6 we can see that the sea surface temperatures of the east pacific have warmed little if at all over nearly the past 32 yearssince the start of the reynolds oiv2 sea surface temperature dataset in november 1981 the east pacific 90s90n 18080w covers about 33 of the surface of the global oceans the papers presented by jeff tollefson do not address this lack of warming and climate models do not simulate it figure 6 the same hold true for whats illustrated in the righthand graph and they are the sea surface temperature anomalies of the south atlantic indian and west pacific oceans the coordinates are listed in the title block they cover more than 50 of the surface of the global oceans we can see a number of things in the sea surface temperature data for the south atlantic indian and west pacific oceans 1 their longterm warming depends on the el niño events of 19868788 and 199798 and possibly the el niño of 200910 2 they do not cool proportionally during the transition to the trailing la niñas of 198889 and 199801 but 3 they do cool slightly over the decadelong periods between the el niño events of 19868788 and 199798 and between the 199798 and 200910 el niños for an introductory discussion of the natural warming of the global oceans refer to the illustrated essay the manmade global warming challenge 42mb the sea surface temperatures of the north atlantic are governed by another mode of natural variability called the atlantic multidecadal oscillation or amo which has been overlooked by jeff tollefson the amo is the reason why the sea surface temperatures there warmed at a much higher rate than the rest of the global oceans from the mid1970s to the early2000s but the sea surface temperature data for the north atlantic indicate the amo may have already peaked see figure 7 if history repeats itself and there is no reason to believe it will not then the sea surface temperatures of the north atlantic will show no warming and actually cool for a few more decades assuming the atlantic multidecadal oscillation has in fact peaked figure 7 note for further information about the atlantic multidecadal oscillation see noaas aoml atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory frequently asked questions webpage here and my blog post here and my introduction to the atlantic multidecadal oscillation here closing the article by jeff tollefson suggests the climate science community may be moving in the right direction—thats a big may be but theyll have to return to basics enso is fueled by sunlight and for that reference as ive presented numerous times before we have trenberth et al 2002 evolution of el niño–southern oscillation and global atmospheric surface temperatures the negative feedback between sst and surface fluxes can be interpreted as showing the importance of the discharge of heat during el niño events and of the recharge of heat during la niña events relatively clear skies in the central and eastern tropical pacific allow solar radiation to enter the ocean apparently offsetting the below normal ssts but the heat is carried away by ekman drift ocean currents and adjustments through ocean rossby and kelvin waves and the heat is stored in the western pacific tropics this is not simply a rearrangement of the ocean heat but also a restoration of heat in the ocean in other words the stronger trade winds reduce cloud cover which in turn allows more sunlight to warm the tropical pacific so if the stronger trade winds are causing more warm water to be stacked up in the western tropical pacific its an increase in sunlight thats fueling it this was discussed in much more detail under the heading of downward shortwave radiation versus downward longwave radiation during la niña events in the post open letter to the royal meteorological society regarding dr trenberths article has global warming stalled like this like loading

            "text": "UPDATE: I finished writing this post and published it at my blog Climate Observations about the same time that Don Easterbrook’s post Cause of ‘the pause’ in global warming was published at WattsUpWithThat.\n\nThis post includes an overview of the mistakes people make when they attempt to use the Pacific Decadal Oscillation data as a metric for the dominant mode of variability in the Pacific Ocean.  So it contradicts Easterbrook’s post. More detailed discussions of what the PDO data represents and what it doesn’t represent can be found in the posts here, here and here.  If you for some reason would like to argue about it on this thread, please see my comments on the Easterbrook thread starting here.\n\n# # #\n\nThe Nature article Climate Change: The Case of the Missing Heat by Jeff Tollefson has received a lot of attention at WattsUpWithThat and around the blogosphere.  Much of Tollefson’s article was a simplified explanation of the findings of Trenberth and Fasullo (2013) An apparent hiatus in global warming?  We’ve discussed that paper already. See the posts Trenberth and Fasullo Try to Keep the Fantasy Alive and More on Trenberth and Fasullo (2013) “An Apparent Hiatus in Global Warming?”\n\nAnthony Watts was right to call attention to Tollefson’s article; it presented an argument and illustration that had been presented years ago by skeptics, an argument and illustration that had been dismissed by global warming enthusiasts. And Tollefson is linking it to Trenberth and Fasullo.\n\nOne point needs to be made right from the get go. As far as I could tell,  no one interviewed for the Nature article claimed the hiatus in surface warming was not happening. That article is an attempt to explain the growing differences between the model simulations and measured global average surface temperatures.  And the more I look at it, Tollefson appears a bit skeptical at times.\n\nOne problem with Tollefson’s article: it only discusses the hiatus in surface temperature warming.  It does not address the absence of warming of the Pacific Ocean and North Atlantic to depths of 2000 meters, for the period of 2003 to 2012.  See Figure 1. Only the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans show warming to depth.  Figure 1 is from the post here.\n\nFigure 1\n\nManmade greenhouse gases cannot select which ocean basins they decide to warm.\n\nAnd the Tollefson article, unfortunately, offers as much misinformation as information.\n\nThe first problem, as noted above, was the article does not address the “missing heat” in the depths of the Pacific over the last decade, and that is where the heat would have to be appearing if Trenberth and Fasullo (2013) were correct.\n\nThe second problem has to do with using Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) data as a metric for the strength, frequency and duration of El Niño and La Niña events.   It’s the wrong dataset.\n\nEl Niño and La Niña events are the primary focus of the article.  Tollefson acknowledges this with his statement:\n\nBut then he presents Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) data as the metric for El Niños and La Niñas. He’s likely taking his cue from Trenberth and Fasullo (2013) for that.\n\nEl Niño and La Niña events take place in the tropical Pacific, but the Pacific Decadal Oscillation dataset is an abstract form of sea surface temperature data derived from the extratropical North Pacific, not the tropical Pacific.  See Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2\n\nThe PDO data basically represent how closely the spatial pattern of the sea surface temperature anomalies of the North Pacific (north of 20N) resembles the pattern created by ENSO events (where the spatial patterns are warmer in the east and cooler in the central and western North Pacific during El Niños, and cooler in the east and warmer in the central and western North Pacific during La Niñas).  Because that spatial pattern of sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific is also impacted by sea level pressures (and their interrelated wind patterns), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation data are not a true representation of the frequency, magnitude and duration of El Niño and La Niña events.\n\nFor more information about what the PDO represents, and more importantly what it doesn’t represent, see the posts here, here and here.\n\nFigure 3\n\nThe big surprise in the Nature article was the illustration comparing the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) data with the global surface temperatures titled “The Pacific’s Global Reach”. I’ve included it as my Figure 3. It compares the JISAO PDO data to global surface temperature anomalies.  The text in the illustration clearly states:\n\nAdditionally, with respect to the illustration, the article reads:\n\nThis, of course, strongly suggests that the warm phase of the PDO is responsible for part of the warming during the period from 1976 to 1998.  If the PDO can stop the warming, then the PDO had to have contributed to the warming.  That had been a skeptical argument for years. I can recall seeing similar graphs more than 5 years ago.  In fact, it was so popular SkepticalScience wrote a post about it here back in 2008.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no mechanisms through which the PDO (as defined by the JISAO dataset) can cause global surface temperatures to vary.  The sea surface temperatures of the North Pacific north of 20N are inversely related to the PDO data.\n\nThose mechanisms exist in the tropical Pacific and portray themselves as El Niños and La Niñas.  Sea surface temperature-based indices for the strength, frequency and duration of El Niños and La Niñas do exist.  In fact, Trenberth and Stepaniak (2001) Indices of El Niño Evolution (online edition here) recommended using the sea surface temperature anomalies of the NINO3.4 region of the equatorial Pacific (identified as N3.4 in the paper).  See the illustration here for the location of the NINO3.4 region.  Trenberth and Stepaniak (2001) used the HADISST dataset, with the base years of 1950-1979 for anomalies.  Unfortunately, Trenberth and Stepaniak never really provided a scientific justification for using the base years of 1950 to 1979.  So we would be better off using the entire term of the data (1923 to 2013) as the base years for the NINO3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies.\n\nThe NINO3.4 sea surface temperature data are realistic index for strength, frequency and duration of El Niño and La Niña events. So let’s look at the average NINO3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies for the two warming periods and the two hiatus periods. See Figure 4.  We’ll use the periods defined by Trenberth and Fasullo (2013):\n\nCuriously, the periods presented by Trenberth and Fasullo (2013) do not agree with those presented by Tollefson in his “The Pacific’s Global Reach” illustration. That aside, my Figure 4 shows that during the two warming periods of 1923 to 1942 and 1976 to 1998, the average sea surface temperature anomalies for the NINO3.4 region were well above zero.  This means that El Niño events dominated that period. Global surface temperatures should warm during those periods because the tropical Pacific is releasing more heat than “normal” from the tropical Pacific and redistributing more warm water than “normal” to adjacent ocean basins. And during the two hiatus periods of 1943 to 1976 and 1999 to present, the average NINO3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies are below zero.  That of course means the tropical Pacific is releasing less heat than “normal” and redistributing less warm water than “normal” to adjacent ocean basins.  And during those periods global surface temperatures flattened or cooled slightly.\n\nFigure 4\n\nYou may be asking yourself, why did Bob go through that exercise when it basically showed the same results as Tollefson’s PDO graph?\n\nThe NINO3.4 data are the correct dataset to use and the PDO is not. The PDO does not represent the timing, strength and duration of El Niño and La Niña events.  It portrays an aftereffect of El Niño and La Niña events, combined with the influence of the sea level pressure of the North Pacific.\n\nBut now we have to consider that the NINO3.4 sea surface data only capture the effects of ENSO on a small region of the equatorial Pacific.  They do not represent the processes of ENSO or their aftereffects.  And in no way can NINO3.4 sea surface temperature anomalies account for the warm water that is left over from strong El Niño events, which is redistributed to adjacent ocean basins in their wakes.\n\nMORE MISINFORMATION\n\nThe article states (my boldface):\n\nEntire eastern Pacific? The PDO data do not represent the “entire eastern Pacific”. If he’s thinking sea surface temperature anomalies, that’s also wrong.  There have been a number of El Niño events since 1999.  Those El Niño events occurred in 2002/03…and 2004/05…and 2006/07…and 2009/10.  As a result, the average sea surface temperature anomalies [of the East Pacific], using NOAA’s standard base years 1971-2000 for their Reynolds OI.v2 data, for the period of January 1999 to December 2013 are +0.06 deg C, and that’s a far cry from “a cool state that has continued more or less to this day.” See Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5\n\nMODEL NONSENSE\n\nThe article reads:\n\nClimate models don’t simulate ENSO properly, so this is irrelevant.   See Guilyardi, et al. (2009) “Understanding El Niño in Ocean-Atmosphere General Circulation Models: Progress and Challenges” and Bellenger, et al. (2013): “ENSO Representation in Climate Models: From CMIP3 to CMIP5.” Preprint copy is here.\n\nTHINGS OVERLOOKED\n\nThe following was written for the post Comments on Stefan Rahmstorf’s Post at RealClimate “What ocean heating reveals about global warming”.  The discussion applies here as well.  I’ve changed the Figure numbers and made a few minor revisions for this post.\n\nIn the left-hand graph of Figure 6, we can see that the sea surface temperatures of the East Pacific have warmed little, if at all, over nearly the past 32 years…since the start of the Reynolds OI.v2 sea surface temperature dataset in November 1981. The East Pacific (90S-90N, 180-80W) covers about 33% of the surface of the global oceans.  The papers presented by Jeff Tollefson do not address this lack of warming and climate models do not simulate it.\n\nFigure 6\n\nThe same hold true for what’s illustrated in the right-hand graph, and they are the sea surface temperature anomalies of the South Atlantic, Indian and West Pacific oceans. The coordinates are listed in the title block. They cover more than 50% of the surface of the global oceans. We can see a number of things in the sea surface temperature data for the South Atlantic, Indian and West Pacific oceans: (1) their long-term warming depends on the El Niño events of 1986/87/88 and 1997/98 (and possibly the El Niño of 2009/10); (2) they do not cool proportionally during the transition to the trailing La Niñas of 1988/89 and 1998-01; but (3) they do cool slightly over the decade-long periods between the El Niño events of 1986/87/88 and 1997/98 and between the 1997/98 and 2009/10 El Niños.\n\nFor an introductory discussion of the natural warming of the global oceans refer to the illustrated essay “The Manmade Global Warming Challenge” (42MB).\n\nThe sea surface temperatures of the North Atlantic are governed by another mode of natural variability called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation or AMO, which has been overlooked by Jeff Tollefson.  The AMO is the reason why the sea surface temperatures there warmed at a much higher rate than the rest of the global oceans from the mid-1970s to the early-2000s. But the sea surface temperature data for the North Atlantic indicate the AMO may have already peaked. See Figure 7. If history repeats itself, and there is no reason to believe it will not, then the sea surface temperatures of the North Atlantic will show no warming and actually cool for a few more decades, assuming the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation has, in fact, peaked.\n\nFigure 7\n\nNote: For further information about the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, see NOAA’s  AOML (Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory) Frequently Asked Questions webpage here, and my blog post here and my introduction to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation here.\n\nCLOSING\n\nThe article by Jeff Tollefson suggests the climate science community may be moving in the right direction—that’s a big MAY BE.\n\nBut they’ll have to return to basics: ENSO is fueled by sunlight.  And for that reference, as I’ve presented numerous times before, we have Trenberth et al. (2002) Evolution of El Niño–Southern Oscillation and global atmospheric surface temperatures:\n\nIn other words, the stronger trade winds reduce cloud cover, which, in turn, allows more sunlight to warm the tropical Pacific. So, if the stronger trade winds are causing more warm water to be stacked up in the western tropical Pacific, it’s an increase in sunlight that’s fueling it.  This was discussed in much more detail under the heading of DOWNWARD SHORTWAVE RADIATION VERSUS DOWNWARD LONGWAVE RADIATION DURING LA NIÑA EVENTS in the post Open Letter to the Royal Meteorological Society Regarding Dr. Trenberth’s Article “Has Global Warming Stalled?”",

government money through grants to their former employers and colleagues note weve known about this collusion since the very early 1990s and have a set of audio tapes of the egas 1992 meeting they

strategy in spain has resulted in huge job losses and escalating costs to spanish consumers study only 375 of atmospheric co2 is manmade from burning fossil fuels climate depot july19 2014 a paper published today in atmospheric chemistry and physics finds that only about 375 15 ppm of the co2 in the lower atmosphere is manmade from the burning of fossil fuels and thus the vast remainder of the 400 ppm atmospheric co2 is from landuse changes and natural sources such as ocean outgassing and plant respiration the findings are in stark contrast to alarmist claims that essentially all of the alleged 130 ppm parts per million increase in co2 since preindustrial times is of manmade origin from the burning of fossil fuels finding instead that only 15 ppm or 115 of the increase is of fossil fuel origin note if these findings are confirmed it would blow the entire mancaused theory out of the water expect a blistering attack by the greens on these authors and their findings most if not all with be smear attacks without facts or if they attempt to use facts they will be based in pseudoscience the crippling cost although congress tells us that the cap and trade legislation will only cost an average family less than 200 a year that is just wrong very wrong it is the biggest tax increase in the history of the united states but congress is hiding it so you cant see it analyses done by independent organizations shows that it will cost families many thousands of dollars a year and will drastically lower our standard of living it hits the poor especially hard even with federal rebates

will prove to be a heavy blow to the epa�s future plans to regulate carbon more than 6 million buildings and facilities potentially would now need permits under epas new regs this included schools churches apartment buildings and everything in between which even the epa recognized would be absurd the epa had another solution tailor the statute � or essentially rewrite it � to increase permitting levels to target major facilities like power plants while reserving authority to tighten thresholds over time so that an increasing number of buildings and facilities ultimately would be required to obtain permits the court told the epa that basic separation of powers principles do not permit executive branch agencies to rewrite duly enacted laws the court therefore struck down the tailoring rule holding that it would be patently unreasonable � not to say outrageous � for the epa to insist on seizing expansive power to rewrite congressional enactments note i have warned of epas rewrite in range magazine for 2 years although early reports of the courts ruling seemed to suggest limited curtailment of the epas rules on carbon it now appears the court really clipped the wings of epas continuous attempts to become the high priest of the us if so it is a real win for every american failure of climate models leading international scientists explain why mancaused global warming

reference network shows the temperature pause wuwt june 8 2014 the us climate reference network provides the most accurate surface temperature network in the world not only is there a pause in the posited temperature rise from alleged manmade global warming but a clearly evident slight cooling trend in the us average temperature over nearly the last decade there is a slight cooling in maximum temperatures and the heat wave events seen in 2006 and 2012 were isolated weather incidents and not part of the near decadal trend a cooling trend of almost 1 o f in the minimum temperatures across the contiguous united states for nearly a decade note this very accurate data set should prove that we have had a pause maybe even a decline in earths temperature since 2005 when the network first

last december both wind and solar power came to an almost complete halt for more than a week more than 23000 wind turbines stood still while one million photovoltaic systems failed to generate energy due to a lack of sunshine for a whole week conventional power plants had to provide almost all of germany�s electricity supply germans woke up to the fact that it was the complete failure of renewable energy to deliver that undermined the stability and security of germany�s electricity system note this is what the us has to look for as obama forces us to depend on more wind and solar energy it is absolutely insane what happened in germany and england last year is reality people could have died if coal fired plants had already been torn down obama�s big epa announcement tomorrow translates directly to higher electricity prices wuwt june 2 2014 the president thinks his plan will boost the economy by 43 billion to 74 billion hes living in a fantasy world from bloomberg apparently one of those read in to tomorrows announcement president barack obama will propose cutting greenhousegas emissions from the nation�s power plants by an average of 30 percent from 2005 levels � he�s living in a fantasy world note thats an understatement especially when australia is abandoning all of its green initiatives and europe is abandoning them as fast as possible alternative energy is proving to be a total failure without huge government subsidies obama is still pedal to the medal what world does he live on germanys green jobs miracle collapses global warming policy foundation may 28 2014 renewable energy was supposed to create tens of thousands of green jobs yet despite threedigit euro billions of subsidies the number of jobs is falling rapidly seven out of ten jobs will only remain as long as the subsidies keep flowing note as germany continues slash subsidies so go the jobs since alternative energy can not survive on its owneven after 15 years of subsidies last year germanys solar industry collapsed wind can not be far behind yet obama wants to drive the us over the same cliff theres a problem attributing west antarctic ice sheet collapse to human activity wuwt may 26 2014 reports that a portion of the west antarctic ice sheet has begun to irretrievably collapse threatening a 4foot rise in sea levels over the next couple of centuries surged through the news media last week mike wolvic a graduate researcher who studies ice sheet dynamics warned the marine ice sheet instability is an inherent part of ice sheet dynamics that doesn�t require any human forcing to operate calling the link between co2 and the glacial collapse in west antarctica �pretty tenuous� emphasis original note the mainstream news went ballistic over this as if it were caused by man and was going to happen tomorrow instead of 200 to 1000 years from now this led california gov brown to proclaim lax los angeles international airport would have to be moved because it would be under water hmm lax is 120 feet above sea level brown must be using common core math which is in line with browns longtime nick names of moonbeam and space cadet europe has 28year shale gas rebuff to russia bloomberg europe may 19 2014 the european union has enough gas trapped in shale to free the bloc from reliance on russian energy supplies for about 28 years if only the constituent countries are prepared to extract it the 28nation bloc which looks to russia for about a third of its oil and gas needs is discussing ways to diversify its energy sources following russian threats to cut natural gas supplies to ukraine note amazingly europeans are so socialist that most are willing to be under the thumb of russia than to develop the shale oil and gas meanwhile new exploration in britain shows they may have 86 billion barrels of oil currently 31 billion and 1300 trillion cubic feet of gas in s england shale a 50 yr supply i was victimised for challenging zealots daily mail may 17 2014 professor bengtssons research suggested carbon dioxide may be less damaging to the planet than feared he was viciously demonized by alarmists who kept his research from being published �benny peiser of the gwpf said the professor�s case was just one example of a �poisonous atmosphere� pervading climate change research he said many scientists with dissenting views were having their research rejected by the editors of scientific journals and young scientists were censoring their work out of fear for their careers note science is rapidly becoming politicized where no dissent is allowed we are rapidly heading for a new dark age of ignorance and witch hunts bullying of climate skeptics wuwt may 16 2014 lennart bengtsson is about as distinguished as climate scientists get his decision two weeks ago to join the academic advisory boardglobal warming policy foundation was greeted with fury by many fellow climate scientists now in a mccarthyite move � his analogy � they have bullied him into resigning by refusing to collaborate with him unless he leaves lord lawson said in a recent speech �i have never in my life experienced the extremes of personal hostility vituperation and vilification that i along with other dissenters of course have received for my views on global warming and globalwarming policies� note like other progressive ideologies global warming is no longer treated as a science it never was but as a religion in which like radical islam seeks to destroy anyone who disagrees with them this will not end well weaker solar activity means colder and colder also means drier wuwt may 14 2014 in effect figure 4 predicts a megadrought for north america from at least 2050 to 2200 generations of people will experience what a dalton minimum is like all their lives in the meantime it will get colder and drier in terms of the effect on agricultural productivity productivity of corn production in the corn belt falls by 10 for each 1�c fall in annual average temperature the corn belt also moves south by 144 km for each 1�c fall in annual average temperature soil quality declines to the south of the corn belt though so farms won�t be as productive note dont panic this article doesnt predict what will happen to earths temperatures but defines what is likely to happen if we are moving towards a dalton minimum no sun spots temps decline by 2 o c it could reduce global food production by 30 this is much much worse than global warming and it has nothing to do with co2 emissions antarctic sea ice at record levels the australian may 12 2014 antarctic sea ice has expanded to record levels for april increasing by more than 110000sq km a day last month to nine million square kilometers the national snow and ice data centre said the rapid expansion had continued into may and the seasonal cover was now bigger than the record �by a significant margin�� note antarctica sea ice continues to get bigger defying the global warming narrative arctic sea ice was still below average in 2013 but was much greater than 2012 some scientists are predicting the arctic minimum will be above average in 2014 we shall see us and europe planning to cut off russias gas supply the independent may 9 2014 us and other european countries are planning to �disarm� the threat of president vladimir putin using russian gas and oil supplies as �a weapon� against ukraine and its eastern european neighbours at the same timea plan to eliminate europe�s reliance on russian oil and gas over the longer term and prevent energy security being used as political bargaining chip by the kremlin note this is the one threat that is probably holding putin back from invading eastern ukraine this is no surprise question where is this european gas going to come from the us will not have any export facilities until 2015 and as i currently understand it europe can only increase production by a small amount whats europe going to do if putin cuts off its gas next winter once again if progressives and socialists had not refused to develop natural gas in the early 2000s this problem with russia would have never arisen national climate assessment report alarmists offer untrue unrelenting doom and gloom wuwt may 6 2014 since even immediate and total shutdown of all carbon dioxideemitting vehicles power plants and factories in the us would decrease global warming by only a hypothetical and undetectable two tenths of a degree celsius by 2100 it is misleading to imply as the report does that the obama administration�s climate policies can provide any measurable protection from extreme weather events the assessment is flat out wrong that climate change is increasing our vulnerability to heat stress as hot weather has become more frequent people and communities have adapted to it and heatrelated mortality in the us has declined note this report is a disgusting propaganda piece their is no attempt at any objectivity literally the truth is opposite anything it says there has been little to no extreme weather for nearly a decade in any category that this administration can put out such a bald faced lie to the american people and get away with it is a very scary condemnation of the deluded citizenry they apparently will believe anything is the ipcc government approval process broken wuwt april 26 2014 from dr robert stavins ipcc lead author a grueling week spent in berlin germany april 513 2014 at the government approval sessions in which some 195 country delegations discussed revised and ultimately approved linebyline the �summary for policymakers� spm which condenses more than 2000 pages of text from 15 chapters into an spm document of 33 pages several of the lead authors present with me in berlin commented that given the nature and outcome of the week the resulting document should probably be called the summary by policymakers rather than the summary for policymakers stavins goes on to describe the systematic deconstruction of the real science in the spm and turned into a political document that has nothing to do with the real science but everything to do with science note finally the real scientists are exposing the enormous ipcc fraud whats happening from the office of michael coffman april 25 2014 many of you are wondering why we havent posted anything for almost two weeks its because we are consumed with digging into the bundy ranch standoff we have gone back two hundred years to follow the paper trail it is stunning even horrifying what this government has done to the citizens of the west the media has totally made hash out of reality and it designed to divert our attention from the truth a series of wellreferenced articles will be posted soon that explains how we got here and how bundys constitutional rights have been violated additionally i have been up to my eyes organizing a major conference in los angeles on the shutoff of water by the feds to farmers in california the federal government is literally at war with its citizens in its lust to subject all of our rights to its dictates if you live in the la area this is a must conference to attend httpwwwamericanfreedomallianceorglectureseriescalifornialandandwaterwarsjsp climate control brain washing in schools global warming policy foundation april 2014 a new report describes how environmentalism has come to permeate school curricula across the uk passing examinations will now usually involve the ability to recite green mantras rather than understanding the subtle questions of science and economics involved the authors review in detail the climate change teaching materials currently used in british schools with disturbing results there is ample evidence of unscientific statements manipulated graphs and activist materials used in class and even found in textbooks note the same thing is happening in the us with common core and the next generation science standards we have reviewed the latter and are stunned at the outright propaganda the standards force textbook companies to include in their textbooks stay tuned is the pacific experiencing another warm el nino wuwt april 7 2014 with the possibility of an el nino developing later this year still considered a 50 there is the possibility of a new record high global temperature if the el nino is sufficiently strong enough i roy spenser phd personally don�t think this is going to happen because we are in the negative phase of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo which favors stronger la nina and weaker el nino of course an el nino at the end of the record will increase the global temperature trend�at least temporarily�but el nino is often followed by a cool la nina which would basically cancel out that effect note heads up if this el nino does occur and the earth warms perhaps to record levels expect the alarmists and the compliant media to proclaim warming has resumed and the earth is going to turn into a cinder if we don�t destroy our economy by limiting fossil fuel emissions stay calm it will be shortlived the ipccs latest report deliberately excludes and misrepresents important climate science forbes march 31 2014 the latest ipcc working group ii�s contribution to the 5 th assessment report released last december has made headlines of doom and gloom this week the nipcc skeptics report comes out next week the nipcc report shows how �eight reasons for concern� are either totally wrong or over exaggerated this article provides a convenient way to compare and contrast the ipcc�s lies and exaggerations some key points made y nipcc 1 �there is little or no risk of increasing food insecurity due to global warming� 2 �no changes in precipitation patterns snow monsoons or river flows� 3 �higher atmospheric co2 concentrations benefit plant growth�that help land plants overcome drought conditions�that enhance their growth rates and water use efficiencies� 4 �a modest warming of the planet will result in a net reduction of human mortality from temperaturerelated events� note an excellent summary remember the real threat comes from the now likely global cooling hitting hard in 2020 or thereabouts climate changing get used to it and get ready financial post march 31 2014 there are in effect two different worlds at the ipcc the objective is to fan fears of fossilfuelinduced global crises brought on by rising carbon emissions in the rest of the world demand for fossil fuels continues to expand regardless of the carbon risks the existential conflict is personified in john kerry us secretary of state who is now simultaneously warning of the grave dangers posed by climate change while touting expanded us gas exports note of the two issues obama is still favoring the need to cut co2 emissions and to hell with the economy or our ability to supply europe with gas and oil of the roughly 22 liquid natural gas lng export facilities being built only one has a full permit after years of waiting three more have provisional permits that may or may not ever receive a final permit almost all of the 22 could have received full permits by now like the xl pipeline obama is slowing the process to glacial speeds �to the significant detriment of all americans britains secret bid to fix un climate report impact on economy is ramped up daily mail march 30 2014 the economic impact of global warming was ramped up in the final draft by the un�s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc shortly before authors wrote the final version a british government official passed scientists a note complaining about an earlier more moderate draft tory mp peter bone said �it is always the same with climate change if the facts don�t suit them they change it to suit them but one of its contributors has accused the ipcc of being too �alarmist� � and demanded his name be withdrawn note this is part ii of the ipccs fifth assessment the first issued in late 2013 every ipcc assessment has been politicized to show alarmist predictions this one is no different every prediction it makes on extreme weather ocean temps rises are exactly the opposite of what is claimed in the summary for policy makers it never ceases to amaze us how the media lets them get away with baldfaced lies benefits of carbon use far outweigh its costs investors daily march 19 2014 the environmental protection agency and other government agencies say fossil fuel and carbon dioxide emissions cause dangerous global warming�the agencies assume earths climate is highly sensitive to co2 then hypothesize almost every carbon cost including the impact on agriculture forestry water resources coastal cities ecosystems wildlife and human health had they followed federal laws and basic benefitcost analysis rules they would have found that hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide benefits outweigh the cost by at as much as 500to1 by addressing only the supposed impact and monetary cost of carbonbased fuel � while ignoring its most significant welldocumented benefits � government analyses and regulatory proposals violate the law note this shouldn�t be a surprise to anyone federal costbenefit analyses have always forged even a 5001 benefitcost ratio is not surprising the epa should be taken to court on april 24th 2014 china may unveil a secret new financial weapon built to bankrupt millions of americans this has nothing to do with global warming but you must be warned stansberry research march 11 2014 for over a decade china has been secretly cornering the market on gold they mine their own gold and are buying massive amounts of gold on the world market much of it secretly to back their yuan to challenge the us dollar as the worlds reserve currency this unique weapon will disrupt nearly every aspect of normal american life with potentially devastating results learn what you absolutely must do now to prepare and protect your family note we have been warning of this for years and wrote extensively on it in our global financial death spiral series last fall it may not happen in april but china is committed to doing this very soon and you are not being warned if you havent read this series of articles it is imperative that you do swimming in a sea of disinformation over the great barrier reef herald sun march 10 2014 my god but journalists are suckers for warming scares the unquestioning sydney morning herald reported thelatest scare �the great barrier reef will be irreversibly damaged by climate change in just 16 years according to leading reef researcher ove hoeghguldberg but none of last week�s reports bothered to add that he also has a lousy track record in scaremongering note since the 1990s ove hoeghguldberg has cried the eminent demise of the great barrier reef only to say a few years later how relieved he was that the reef rebounded with flying colors his issued other false scaremonger stories as well but the press faithfully regurgitate each proclamation as coming from on high with no doubt of his credibility see the journalists trailing behind their messiah questioning nothing repeating everything oversensitive how the ipcc hid the good news on global warming global warming policy foundation march 1 2014 for the last two generations of climate models the value for longterm warming has averaged 32 ◦ c per doubling of co2 in the fourth assessment report 2007 of the ipcc the empirical estimates of climate sensitivity were largely based on poor data and used an inappropriate statistical basis biasing them towards higher values of climate sensitivity and thus making the global warming problem appear �worse� in the recent fifth assessment report fall 2013 many studies still use inappropriate data andor statistical methodology good empirical estimates of both longterm warming and that over a seventy year period now imply very different expectations of future warming than do climate models � some 40 to 50 lower to 2081�2100 note weve been saying this for years but this is the first hard evidence backing up our assertion what ukraine needs is an americanstyle shale gas revolution forbes march 3 2014 ukraine serves as a transit point for about 6 billion cubic feet per day of russia�s natgas exports into europe that�s about 22 trillion cubic feet per year or 14 of europe�s supply ukraine could hold more than 40 trillion cubic feet of recoverable shale gas enough to satisfy decades of demand it is located in the far west northeast next to russia and crimea russia now controls the two eastern fields now with yanukovich gone it�s as if putin has taken the crimea as a kind of hostage � collateral to hold against what ukraine owes russia for gas a few billion dollars in ious is of course a less than flimsy pretext for thuggery which is why the kremlin�s propaganda machine has been spreading lies about how his soldiers are there to save ukraine�s ethnic russians from rightwing crazies note there is one more reason russia is paranoid of europe and the ukraine has served as a buffer for centuries russia has never allowed ukraine to develop its abundant natural resources and stalin brutally starved up to 6 million ukrainians in 193233 to weaken them industry bosses demand eu action on soaring energy prices eu observer february 28 2014 eu leaders must address rising energy prices and climate policies which are crippling the blocs manufacturing sector according to a manifesto signed by more than 100 industry bosses the eus manufacturing sector has been in steady decline for the past 20 years and now accounts for just 15 percent of economic output meanwhile 4 million manufacturing jobs across europe have been lost since 2008 note as reported for the past six months the eu is in full retreat of its green energy policies abandoning co2 emission reduction targets and backing out of expensive subsidies it is likely the green energy fiasco will be dead in two years green energy is probably responsible for half the 4 million lost manufacturing jobs across europe more practical conservatives warned them this would happen when the socialists started the green energy policies 12 years ago the eu green catastrophe doesnt faze obama however like a true progressive he knows how to do it right never mind the eu socialists did too 95 of climate models agree actual observed temperatures must be wrong wuwt february 10 2010 i�m seeing a lot of wrangling over the recent 15 year pause in global average warming�when did it start is it a full pause shouldn�t we be taking the longer view etc these are all interesting exercises but they miss the most important point the climate models that governments base policy decisions on have failed miserably that should have major policy implications�assuming policy is still informed by facts more than emotions and political aspirations note unfortunately policy doesnt have anything to do with facts and everything to do with political agendas the only proof warming alarmists have that man is causing warming are these models which have as their core driver a strong positive correlation with increasing co2 then they use the models to prove co2 causes warming circular reasoning except nature is not complying with the models explanation of graph hadcrut4 is the surface data produced by the cru and used by the ipcc uah is the far more accurate satellite measured temperatures europe stats to run not walk away from green economics investors business daily february 5 2014 in recent weeks europe has decided to run not walk as fast as it can away from the economic menace of green energy in brussels last month european leaders agreed to scrap pernation caps on carbon emissions the eu countries � france germany italy and spain � had promised a 40 reduction in emissions by 2030 and 80 by 2050 the new german economic minister sigmar gabriel says green energy mandates have become such an albatross around the neck of industry that they could lead to a deindustrialization of germany now those caps wont apply to individual nations green dreams have collided with cold economic reality green programs arent creating green jobs but green unemployment at intolerable doubledigit rates the quip in economically exhausted europe these days is that before we save the planet we have to save ourselves note see our penetrating article the disconnect on this written last fall antarctic sea ice sets new record for jan 31 not a lot of people know that february 2 2014 antarctic sea ice extent continues to break records extent at 31st january of 4540 million sq km beat the previous record set in 2008 this is 26 higher than the climatological average for this date of 3598 million sq km on average antarctic sea ice reaches minimum on 20th february about a month earlier relatively speaking it is likely then that we will see a new record high minimum set this month note global warming enthusiasts are getting thumped every time they turn around for the past 14 months seems like nature is not following their meme on anything they claim is the absolute truth us decjan temperatures 3rd coldest in 30 years the winter months of december 2013 and january 2014 averaged over the contiguous 48 united states were the 3rd coldest decjan in the last 30 years� an interesting feature is that 5 of the last 7 years have been below the 41year average which has happened only one other time in the 41year period note does this confirm earth is sliding into another cooling cycle no however this plus a lot of other evidence is building a solid case that a cooling cycle even another little ice age is underway but we have a ways to go before that is confirmed obamas sotu speech big on natural gas wall street journal january 29 2014 after upbeat comments about america�s energy boom president barack obama gave a big shout out to natural gas tuesday citing its impact on lowering carbon emission pollution and on businesses willingness to invest 100 million �i�ll cut red tape to help states get those factories built� mr obama said just 10 days ago 18 environmental groupsslammed the white house�s current energy strategy �all of the above� that draws on fossil fuelsoil natural gas and coal as well as clean energy note has obama had an epiphany and is no longer antifossil fuel we could dream its true but its not he also reaffirmed the mantra that climate change ie mancaused global warming is a fact he is doing what we forecast he would do throw the eco nuts under the bus and promote natural gas to bring in billions of tax dollars so he can dole out goodies and completely snooker the american people read our our last spring�s mindbending article new climate data rigging scandal rocks us government principia scientific international january 19 2014 �a newly uncovered and monumental calculating error in official us government climate data shows beyond doubt that climate scientists unjustifiably added a whopping one degree of phantom warming to the official �raw� temperature record� skeptics believe the discovery may trigger the biggest of all �climate con� scandals in congress and sound the death knell on american climate policy note this should blow the global warming hysteria out of the water but it wont the hysteria has nothing to do with science and everything to do with a political agenda the press will never let this see the light of day green energy giant runs out of cash the local january 23 2014 german wind energy giant prokon filed for insolvency on wednesday leaving tens of thousands of investors worried about their money the company advertised itself as a safe bet offering eight percent returns prokon which builds and manages wind parks has been a leading player in germanys ambitious plan to switch to renewable energy it managed to attract 75000 investors through a successful advertising campaign note another green manufacturer fails even with exorbitant subsidies if germany cuts back on these subsidies probably when not if how are these companies going to survive they cant never could socialist progressive insanity rides again germanys industrial base at risk if green energy shift fails reuters january 21 2014 germany risks undermining its industrial base if it fails to undertake radical reform of incentives for the countrys renewable energy sector its new economy minister said on tuesday in a clear signal of his support for industry exportoriented german companies have warned that a surge in power costs caused largely by the green power incentives will make them internationally uncompetitive and some have even threatened to move out according to a draft proposal seen by reuters at the weekend economy minister gabriel will recommend to the cabinet that germany cuts the support price paid for electricity from solar and wind power generators by about a third by 2015 note this was forecast ten years ago there is no way green energy can be economically viable with current technology the entire eu green energy program is in total collapse yet obama blindly destroys our coal industry and pushes the same failed policies full steam ahead he is either insane or is deliberately destroying america or both is a mini ice age on the way scientists warn sun gone to sleep january 17 2014 the suns activity is at its lowest for 100 years scientists have warned they say the conditions are eerily similar to those before the maunder minimum a time in 1645 when a mini ice age hit freezing londons river thames we have 400 years of observations and it is in a very similar to phase as it was in the runup to the maunder minimum the world we live in today is very different human activity may counteract this it is difficult to say what the consequences are note this subject is now being hotly discussed in the scientific community and as we have reported many times before by a rapidly growing number of scientists this article lists comments from several scientists what caught my attention is the claim by one that human activity may counteract this forecast cooling maybe however that assumes co2 has played a role in warming evidence is now solidly against that its most likely the sun europe to ditch climate protection goals spiegel online international january 15 2014 the eus reputation as a model of environmental responsibility may soon be history the european commission wants to forgo ambitious climate protection goals and pave the way for fracking jeopardizing germanys touted energy revolution in the process as of 2020 at the latest when the current commitment to further increase the share of green energy expires climate protection in the eu will apparently be pursued on a voluntary basis in addition the authority wants to pave the way in the eu for the controversial practice of fracking the report says the commission does not intend to establish strict rules for the extraction of shale gas but only minimum health and environmental standards note weve been reporting the slow progress of the eu to this goal resulting from the near cataclysmic disaster green energy has been in europe see my article the disconnect now the floodgates are open environmentalists and socialists are about to suffer their first total defeat in many decades yes there is hope virginia extended cold blast to last past groundhog day wuwt january 21 2014 weatherbell senior forecaster joe d�aleo cofounder of the weather channel with john coleman almost never writes like this when he does it gets my attention a new forecast shows the cold blast in the eastern half of the usa extending well past groundhog day feb 2nd according to their models weatherbell has had an excellent track record this winter so far he says he hasn�t seen anything like it since 1918 when the big flu pandemic hit the usa note this is serious the polar vortex in late december and early january was significant if this forecast is correct it will beat the cooling from 194579 and get into the frigid climate of the early 20 th century however one year a trend does not make even so with the record winters in europe and asia the past two years it bears watching a rapidly increasing number of solar scientists physicists geologists and even climatologists are now warning we are entering a 4070 solar hibernation which could produce record low temperatures and disastrous crop failures of the little ice age in the 1700s and 1800s the 20132014 winter could go down as the turning point time years will tell noaa contiguous us average temperature plummeted 29 o f in 2013 wuwt january 16 2014 in 2013 the contiguous united states conus average temperature of 524�f was 03�f above the 20 th century average and tied with 1980 as the 37 th warmest year in the 119year period of record the 2013 annual temperature marked the coolest year for the nation since 2009 the 2013 conus average temperature was 29�f cooler than the 2012 average temperature which was the warmest year on record for the nation note the huge drop in temperature over a year is mostly noteworthy because last year noaa made headline news as the warmest year on record a drop of 29 o f this year shows last year to be an anomaly however the high variation suggests we may be in a transition period to the predicted cooling period climate change the case of the missing heat nature january 15 2014 as the globalwarming hiatus enters its sixteenth year scientists are at last making headway in the case of the missing heat some have pointed to the sun volcanoes and even pollution from china as potential culprits but recent studies suggest that the oceans are key to explaining the anomaly the latest suspect is the el ni�o of 1997�98 which pumped prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere � perhaps enough to tip the equatorial pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since note this is the latest hypothesis by alarmists of why global warming has stopped this time they may have it partially right but for the wrong reasons el ni�os and la ni�as do play a large rolefar more than co2 however it is likely that this phenomenon is caused by the sun not co2 the fact that the prestigious nature proposes that el ni�os and la ni�as are a causal factor while not even mentioning co2 is history making not surprisingly alarmists expect that warming will soon commence again poll climate change in the american mind yale university november 2013 this �survey found that 1 in 4 23 americans think that global warming is not happening and half say they are worried about it but about two in three americans 63 believe global warming is happening� fewer than half of americans 38 believe they personally will be harmed a �moderate amount� or a �great deal� by global warming by contrast majorities believe that global warming will harm future generations of people 65 and plant and animal species 65� note it is stunning and discouraging that people still believe mancaused co2driven global warming is still happening when there is zero empirical scientific evidence to support the claim and overwhelming evidence it is the sun it is an enormous testament to the power of an activist media to influence a totally ignorant population with irrational statements like �global warming causes extremely cold temperatures� just how do el ni�os la ni�as and the enso affect earths climate wuwt january 10 2014 el ni�o and la ni�a events are extremely important parts of earth�s climate they are the dominant mode of natural climate variability on annual multiyear and decadal timeframes el ni�o and la ni�a events impact everything from drought and rainfall to surface temperatures around the globe note an easytounderstand illustrated explanation shortterm climate for dummies of this climate driver and worth reviewing if you have any interest in how it works to direct multidecadal climate renewables fiasco doldrums and clouds halt green electricity production die welt december 25 2013 germany�s wind and solar power production came to an almost complete standstill in early december more than 23000 wind turbines stood still one million photovoltaic systems stopped work nearly completely for a whole week coal nuclear and gas power plants had to generate an estimated 95 percent of germany�s electricity supply note this happened in england last year during a deep freeze jeopardizing a million households until they reactivated several coalfired plants that had just been shut down to make way for wind power germany is now building 10 coalfired plants eventually 20 to provide backup to their green fiasco this is the fatal flaw in green energy and was predicted ten years ago before the first solar and wind farms were built antarctic ice shelf melt lowest ever recorded global warming is not eroding it the register january 3 2013 scientists at the british antarctic survey say that the melting of the pine island glacier ice shelf in antarctica has suddenly slowed right down in the last few years confirming earlier research which suggested that the shelfs melt does not result from humandriven global warming as previously thought note everyday new news breaks shattering a previously proven fact supporting

A paper published today in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics finds that only about 3.75% [15 ppm] of the CO2 in the lower atmosphere is man-made from the burning of fossil fuels, and thus, the vast remainder of the 400 ppm atmospheric CO2 is from land-use changes and natural sources such as ocean outgassing and plant respiration. The findings are in stark contrast to alarmist claims that essentially all of the alleged 130 ppm (parts per million) increase in CO2 since pre-industrial times is of man-made origin from the burning of fossil fuels, finding instead that only 15 ppm or ~11.5% of the increase is of fossil fuel origin. NOTE: If these findings are confirmed, it would blow the entire man-caused theory out of the water. Expect a blistering attack by the greens on these authors and their findings. Most, if not all, with be smear attacks without facts, or if they attempt to use facts, they will be based in pseudoscience. The Crippling Cost . Although Congress tells us that the cap and trade legislation will only cost an average family less than $200 a year, that is just wrong. Very wrong. It is the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States. But Congress is hiding it so you can't see it. Analyses done by independent organizations shows that it will cost families many thousands of dollars a year and will drastically lower our standard of living. It hits the poor especially hard, even with federal rebates. This legislation will radically change the United States--forever.\n\nNo 'Free Rein' for the EPA. The Hill, July 2, 2014. Important! An Constitutional attorney part of the recent Supreme Court decision on the EPA explains the decision goes much further than previously thought. The decision \"clearly rein[s] in the agency from what has become a pattern of regulatory overreach. This will prove to be a heavy blow to the EPA�s future plans to regulate carbon...  More than 6 million buildings and facilities potentially would now need permits\" under EPA's new regs. \"This included schools, churches, apartment buildings and everything in between, which even the EPA recognized would be absurd... The EPA had another solution:  'Tailor' the statute � or essentially rewrite it � to increase permitting levels to target major facilities like power plants, while reserving authority to tighten thresholds over time so that an increasing number of buildings and facilities ultimately would be required to obtain permits... The Court told the EPA that basic Separation of Powers principles do not permit Executive Branch agencies to rewrite duly enacted laws.  The Court therefore struck down the Tailoring Rule, holding that 'it would be patently unreasonable � not to say outrageous � for the EPA to insist on seizing expansive power' to rewrite Congressional enactments.\" NOTE: I have warned of EPA's rewrite in Range magazine for 2 years. Although early reports of the Court's ruling seemed to suggest limited curtailment of the EPA's rules on carbon, it now appears the Court really clipped the wings of EPA's continuous attempts to become the High Priest of the U.S. If so, it is a real win for every American. Failure of Climate Models . Leading international scientists explain why man-caused global warming cannot be occurring. The entire man-caused global warming fear is based on climate (computer) models. Climate models cannot duplicate the complexity of earth's climate. When climate models attempt to predict the past they fail miserably to predict to predict what actually happened. Global Warming, Emerging Science and Understanding .",

and cooling cycles short term meaning decades in this case but the socalled skeptics have pointed to this for a very long time more about the paper can be found here the pacific decadal oscillation

difference between the model predictions and what has actually happened the predictions of hansens climate model presented to the us congress in 1988 versus the reality source climatesensenorpag – click to enlarge however instead of simply admitting that the models may be wrong the heat is held to be hiding out in the oceans it is apparently widely hoped that it will return in time to save careers and grants from nature now as the globalwarming hiatus enters its sixteenth year scientists are at last making headway in the case of the missing heat some have pointed to the sun volcanoes and even pollution from china as potential culprits but recent studies suggest that the oceans are key to explaining the anomaly the latest suspect is the el niño of 1997–98 which pumped prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere — perhaps enough to tip the equatorial pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since the 1997 to 98 el niño event was a trigger for the changes in the pacific and i think thats very probably the beginning of the hiatus says kevin trenberth a climate scientist at the national center for atmospheric research ncar in boulder colorado according to this theory the tropical pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming years eventually trenberth says it will switch back in the other direction translation please dear lord let it switch back as soon as possible or the warming check is in the mail that is however perhaps less likely than thought see further below why if one looks at the chart of the pdo above a common sense question immediately springs to mind why was the warming trend prior to 1940 almost identical to that between 1976 and 1998 when obviously co2 emissions at the time can not have been a major factor this is not explained anywhere could it be that natural climate variability is actually the major factor in driving both warming and cooling phases and that co2 emissions by humans are in fact a negligible input interesting is also the following comment by another climate researcher cited in the nature article none of the climate simulations carried out for the ipcc produced this particular hiatus at this particular time that has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared others say that this conclusion goes against the longterm temperature trends as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past and many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively shortterm blip in the climate if you are interested in global climate change your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years says susan solomon a climate scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge emphasis added does that mean that if there is no warming for another century their vaunted models will still not be proved wrong if that is so then the science is guaranteed to only advance one funeral at a time as the saying goes by the way the differentiation between skeptics and scientists is an insult to the many skeptics who are in fact scientists and whose ranks are set to swell in

click to enlarge several skeptics are naturally pointing out that their work is suddenly integrated into the consensus with not a word being mentioned of the ridicule and opposition they had to endure for so long for instance here are dr sebastian lüning and prof fritz vahrenholt it took a while but ocean cycles have finally been adopted by the ipcc as an important climate factor with john fasullo kevin trenberth has written in a new paper appearing in the journal earths future that the warming pause taking place since 1998 indeed may have something to do with the pacific decadal oscillation pdo also even trenberths pal stefan rahmstorf suddenly thinks its a good possibility in 2012 when we brought up the pdo as one of the triggers for the 19761998 warming in our die kalte sonne book and proposed ocean cycles as a sort of pulse generator for temperature cycles on a decadal scale we were met with fierce resistance from the german climate science establishment now less than 2 years later die kalte sonne finds itself as mainstream science they also mention an interesting comment made by julia slingo of the met office at a royal society meeting last year she was playing devils advocate the devil being all those who say the climate models are crap ie the deniers and asked a well known alarmist a question he ultimately couldnt answer at a royal society meeting in 2013 julia slingo of the met office played devils advocate and posed the following question to prof jochen marotzke of the german max planck institute of meteorology see the 4246 mark royalsocietyorgmarotzkemp3 it s a great presentation about 15 years being irrelevant but i think some of us might say if you look at the pacific decadal oscillation and it s timescale that it appears to work it could be 30 years and therefore i think you know we are still not out of the woods yet on this one if you do think it s internal variability and you say we do think the pacific decadal oscillation is a key component of this and it s now in it s particular phase but was previously in the opposite phase could you not therefore explain the accelerated warming of the 80s and 90s as being driven by the other phase of natural variability simplifying slingos incoherence if the current cooling is due to the negative pdo phase then wouldn t the warming of the 80s and 90s be a result of the positive pdo phase back then marotzke answers after much incoherence of his own um i guess i m not sure these people make no sense at all they are sure its the oceans cold phase gobbling up heat when temperatures fail to rise but when temperatures increase they just cant be sure that the oceans are involved at all and insist they would not bet much money on it of course it just cant work only one way marotzke is delivering only what would call unadulterated absurd science emphasis added to ms slingos query what does were not out of the woods really mean that they are scared they have exaggerated and are as one commentator at anthony watts site remarked in need of an exit strategy the problem of modeling the future of a complex system the big problem is that the climate models that are at the root of the catastrophic anthropogenic global warming forecasts are trying to do something that is literally impossible below is a video of a presentation by christopher essex professor and associate chair in the department of applied mathematics at the university of western ontario and former director of its theoretical physics program now one thing we can expect professor essex to know a thing or two about are the mathematics behind the modeling and this is what the presentation focuses on it is done in a way that makes it possible even for a layperson to easily discern what the problems of these models are and that in fact these problems are insurmountable at least at present as an aside professor essex is of course both a skeptic and a scientist and he is far from alone for instance we would like to point readers to a 2009 paper he coauthored with eight other scholars and which has been reviewed by 50 others entitled critical topics in global warming the introduction tells us a little bit about the socalled consensus the issue of global warming is the subject of two parallel debates one scientific focused on the analyses of complex and conflicting data the other political addressing what is the proper response of government to a hypothetical risk proponents of an immediate and sweeping regulatory response insist that the scientific debate has long been settled but a fair reading of the science as presented in the fraser institutes independent summary for policymakers ispm proves otherwise the supplements to that report go deeper into some of the key topics and provide even more evidence that popularized notions about the causes and consequences of global warming are more fiction than fact when looking at the presentation below it becomes crystal clear why the science especially with regard to climate models simply can not be regarded as settled believing 6 impossible things before breakfast and climate modeling by christopher essex the quiet sun now a few remarks on why the missing heat may well go on missing for a good while yet below is an excerpt from a recent article published by the bcc regarding the activity of the sun which has declined to its lowest in at least a century scientists are baffled by this behavior – something highly unusual is evidently happening ive been a solar physicist for 30 years and ive never seen anything quite like this says richard harrison head of space physics at the rutherford appleton laboratory in oxfordshire he shows me recent footage captured by spacecraft that have their sights trained on our star the sun is revealed in exquisite detail but its face is strangely featureless if you want to go back to see when the sun was this inactive youve got to go back about 100 years he says this solar lull is baffling scientists because right now the sun should be awash with activity it has reached its solar maximum the point in its 11year cycle where activity is at a peak this giant ball of plasma should be peppered with sunspots exploding with flares and spewing out huge clouds of charged particles into space in the form of coronal mass ejections but apart from the odd event like some recent solar flares it has been very quiet and this damp squib of a maximum follows a solar minimum – the period when the suns activity troughs – that was longer and lower than scientists expected its completely taken me and many other solar scientists by surprise says dr lucie green from university college londons mullard space science laboratory the drop off in activity is happening surprisingly quickly and scientists are now watching closely to see if it will continue to plummet it could mean a very very inactive star it would feel like the sun is asleep a very dormant ball of gas at the centre of our solar system explains dr green this though would certainly not be the first time this has happened during the latter half of the 17th century the sun went through an extremely quiet phase – a period called the maunder minimum historical records reveal that sunspots virtually disappeared during this time dr green says there is a very strong hint that the sun is acting in the same way now as it did in the runup to the maunder minimum mike lockwood professor of space environment physics from the university of reading thinks there is a significant chance that the sun could become increasingly quiet an analysis of icecores which hold a longterm record of solar activity suggests the decline in activity is the fastest that has been seen in 10000 years its an unusually rapid decline explains prof lockwood we estimate that within about 40 years or so there is a 10 to 20 – nearer 20 – probability that well be back in maunder minimum conditions the era of solar inactivity in the 17th century coincided with a period of bitterly cold winters in europe londoners enjoyed frost fairs on the thames after it froze over snow cover across the continent increased the baltic sea iced over – the conditions were so harsh some describe it as a miniice age emphasis added the article naturally goes on to point out that according to the ipcc the effect of co2 emissions tops every other influence on the climate no wonder as co2 emissions can be taxed try taxing the sun although the odd men out who think the sun is far more important are mentioned in passing but not to worry at worst we will miss the polar lights henceforth somehow this doesnt feel very reassuring – after all if the maunder minimum was irrelevant to the climate then why was there a little ice age admittedly it remains an open question how important the suns activity is to the climate – after all if a complex system like the earths climate can not be successfully modeled this holds for the past as well as for the future it is not possible to state apodictically that the maunder minimum produced the little ice age intuitively though we tend to think that the sun is indeed an important factor on a geological time scale the last major ice age happened only a very short time ago and we know that there have been vast variations in average temperatures over large time scales in fact it is only because we live in a warming cycle on these large time scales an interglacial period that human civilization as we know it exists at all try to imagine feeding more than 7 billion people with the planet a full 8 to 10 degrees celsius colder and with a large part of its landmass covered in ice of course that is certainly not an imminent problem but looking at the regularity with which glacial and interglacial periods occur it seems obvious that it will become a problem one day we happen to think that even a mini ice age could be quite a nuisance it would definitely make life a lot more uncomfortable in the northern hemisphere currently there is no certainty what precisely the main cause of ice ages is but cycles related to the sun specifically the milankovitch cycles which describe changes in earths orbit around the sun are undoubtedly playing a role temperatures plus co2 and dust concentration in the atmosphere over the past 400000 odd years via the vostok ice core data and yes co2 tends to follow temperature it doesnt lead presumably there are feedback loops at work though with higher co2 concentration and temperature reinforcing each other during the up and downswings click to enlarge what is slightly worrisome about the above chart is that the very cold periods tend to have a much longer duration than the warm periods which seem to have a tendency to produce shortlived spike highs in fact the behavior of the long term temperature chart looks very similar to the price charts of a number of commodities conclusion the backtracking has begun – as a first step climate skeptics see their work suddenly integrated into the mainstream however we are not yet at the point where the models are rejected or the greenhouse gascentric agw theory is truly abandoned instead were now in the how can we keep saying we are right while were obviously wrong phase a lot is at stake after all scientific reputations but most importantly a lot of money policymakers dont want to hear that there is no problem because that would close off a major source of tax revenues as well as what is currently a major avenue for crony capitalism and pork barrel spending through the subsidization of uneconomic green energy schemes entire vast bureaucracies depend on agw as well and there is no alternative promotion in sight yet that could replace this sheer inexhaustible and vast fount of tax payer funded nonactivity so now the hope is that the heat is hiding out deep in the oceans and ready to return at the drop of a hat or rather a turn of the trade winds that may however not happen what then charts

            "text": "The above sentence went missing from subsequent IPCC reports. Apparently it was once part of the 'consensus' though. Even though it has disappeared, it nevertheless inadvertently blurted out the truth. A famous 'Climate-gate' e-mail dialog follows below:\n\nWell, it has been more than 15 years of 'no warming' now. Time to get worried? You betcha. A new paper by the above mentioned Dr. Trenberth acknowledges the  importance of the so-called Pacific Decadal Oscillation in determining relatively short term warming and cooling cycles ('short term' meaning decades in this case). But the so-called 'skeptics' have pointed to this for a very long time. More about the paper can be found here.\n\nThe Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Keep in mind that in the mid 1970s, the 'scientific consensus' was worried about global cooling and an imminent new ice age – click to enlarge.\n\nA recent article in 'Nature' discusses the 'case of the missing heat' and what progress is being made in explaining away the fact that none of the models predicting global warming by CO2 forcing can account for the observed reality. As a reminder, here is the difference between the model predictions and what has actually happened:\n\nThe predictions of Hansen's climate model presented to the US Congress in 1988, versus the reality (source: climatesense-norpag) – click to enlarge.\n\nHowever, instead of simply admitting that the models may be wrong, the heat is held to be 'hiding out' in the oceans. It is apparently widely hoped that it will return in time to save careers and grants. From Nature:\n\nTranslation: 'please dear Lord, let it switch back as soon as possible' or: the warming check is in the mail. That is however perhaps less likely than thought (see further below why). If one looks at the chart of the PDO above, a common sense question immediately springs to mind: why was the warming trend prior to 1940 almost identical to that between 1976 and 1998, when obviously, CO2 emissions at the time cannot have been a major factor? This is not explained anywhere. Could it be that natural climate variability is actually the major factor in driving both warming and cooling phases and that CO2 emissions by humans are in fact a negligible input?\n\nInteresting is also the following comment by another climate researcher cited in the Nature article:\n\nDoes that mean that if there is no warming for another century, their vaunted 'models' will still not be proved wrong? If that is so, then the science is guaranteed to only 'advance one funeral at a time' as the saying goes. By the way, the differentiation between 'skeptics' and 'scientists' is an insult to the many skeptics who are in fact scientists (and whose ranks are set to swell in our opinion).\n\nRegarding the long term paleo-climate record, here is an instructive chart putting the 'catastrophic' global warming of the 20th century into proper perspective (source of the chart is this extremely interesting article on the chance that warming will actually turn into cooling).\n\nTemperature anomaly vs. atmospheric CO2 over the past 11,000 years (data gathered by examination of ice cores)- click to enlarge.\n\nSeveral 'skeptics' are naturally pointing out that their work is suddenly 'integrated' into the 'consensus' with not a word being mentioned of the ridicule and opposition they had to endure for so long. For instance, here are Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt:\n\nThey also mention an interesting comment made by Julia Slingo of the Met Office at a Royal Society meeting last year. She was playing 'devil's advocate' (the 'devil' being all those who say the climate models are crap, i.e., the 'deniers') and asked a well known alarmist a question he ultimately couldn't answer:\n\n“At a Royal Society meeting in 2013, Julia Slingo of the Met office played devil’s advocate and posed the following question to Prof. Jochen Marotzke of the German Max Planck Institute of Meteorology, see the 42:46 markroyalsociety.org/marotzke.mp3 : “…it’s a great presentation about 15 years being irrelevant,  but I think, some of us might say if you look at the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and it’s timescale that it appears to work, it could be 30 years, and therefore I think, you know, we are still not out of the woods yet on this one. … If you do think it’s internal variability, and you say we do think the Pacific Decadal Oscillation is a key component of this, and it’s now in it’s particular phase, but was previously in the opposite phase, could you not therefore explain the accelerated warming of the 80s and 90s as being driven by the other phase of natural variability?” Simplifying Slingo’s  incoherence: “If the current cooling is due to the negative PDO phase, then wouldn’t the warming of the 80s and 90s be a result of the positive PDO phase back then?” Marotzke answers after much incoherence of his own: “Um…I guess I’m not sure.” These people make no sense at all. They are sure it’s the oceans’ cold phase gobbling up heat when temperatures fail to rise. But when temperatures increase, they just can’t be sure that the oceans are involved at all, and insist they would not bet much money on it. Of course it just can’t work only one way. Marotzke is delivering only what would call unadulterated absurd science.”\n\nWhat does 'we're not out of the woods' really mean? That they are scared they have exaggerated and are, as one commentator at Anthony Watts' site remarked 'in need of an exit strategy'?\n\nThe big problem is that the climate models that are at the root of the 'catastrophic anthropogenic global warming' forecasts are trying to do something that is literally impossible. Below is a video of a presentation by Christopher Essex,  Professor and Associate Chair in the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Western Ontario and former director of its Theoretical Physics program. Now, one thing we can expect Professor Essex to know a thing or two about are the mathematics behind the modeling, and this is what the presentation focuses on. It is done in a way that makes it possible even for a layperson to easily discern what the problems of these models are, and that in fact, these problems are insurmountable, at least at present.\n\nAs an aside, Professor Essex is of course both a 'skeptic' and a scientist, and he is far from alone. For instance, we would like to point readers to a 2009 paper he  co-authored with eight other scholars (and which has been reviewed by 50 others) entitled 'Critical Topics in Global Warming'. The introduction tells us a little bit about the so-called 'consensus':\n\nWhen looking at the presentation below, it becomes crystal clear why the science, especially with regard to climate models, simply cannot be regarded as 'settled':\n\n“Believing 6 Impossible Things Before Breakfast and Climate Modeling”, by Christopher Essex\n\nNow a few remarks on why the 'missing heat' may well go on missing for a good while yet. Below is an excerpt from a recent article published by the BCC regarding the activity of the sun, which has declined to its lowest in at least a century. Scientists are baffled by this behavior – something highly unusual is evidently happening:\n\n“I've been a solar physicist for 30 years, and I've never seen anything quite like this,\" says Richard Harrison, head of space physics at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire. He shows me recent footage captured by spacecraft that have their sights trained on our star. The Sun is revealed in exquisite detail, but its face is strangely featureless. \"If you want to go back to see when the Sun was this inactive… you've got to go back about 100 years,\" he says. This solar lull is baffling scientists, because right now the Sun should be awash with activity. It has reached its solar maximum, the point in its 11-year cycle where activity is at a peak. This giant ball of plasma should be peppered with sunspots, exploding with flares and spewing out huge clouds of charged particles into space in the form of coronal mass ejections. But apart from the odd event, like some recent solar flares, it has been very quiet. And this damp squib of a maximum follows a solar minimum – the period when the Sun's activity troughs – that was longer and lower than scientists expected. \"It's completely taken me and many other solar scientists by surprise,\" says Dr Lucie Green, from University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory. The drop off in activity is happening surprisingly quickly, and scientists are now watching closely to see if it will continue to plummet. \"It could mean a very, very inactive star, it would feel like the Sun is asleep… a very dormant ball of gas at the centre of our Solar System,\" explains Dr Green. This, though, would certainly not be the first time this has happened.  During the latter half of the 17th Century, the Sun went through an extremely quiet phase – a period called the Maunder Minimum. Historical records reveal that sunspots virtually disappeared during this time. Dr Green says: \"There is a very strong hint that the Sun is acting in the same way now as it did in the run-up to the Maunder Minimum.\" Mike Lockwood, professor of space environment physics, from the University of Reading, thinks there is a significant chance that the Sun could become increasingly quiet. An analysis of ice-cores, which hold a long-term record of solar activity, suggests the decline in activity is the fastest that has been seen in 10,000 years. \"It's an unusually rapid decline,\" explains Prof Lockwood. \"We estimate that within about 40 years or so there is a 10% to 20% – nearer 20% – probability that we'll be back in Maunder Minimum conditions.\" The era of solar inactivity in the 17th Century coincided with a period of bitterly cold winters in Europe. Londoners enjoyed frost fairs on the Thames after it froze over, snow cover across the continent increased, the Baltic Sea iced over – the conditions were so harsh, some describe it as a mini-Ice Age.\n\nThe article naturally goes on to point out that according to the IPCC, the effect of CO2 emissions tops every other influence on the climate (no wonder, as CO2 emissions can be taxed. Try taxing the sun!), although the odd men out who think the sun is far more important are mentioned in passing. But not to worry! At worst we will miss the 'polar lights' henceforth. Somehow this doesn't feel very reassuring – after all, if the Maunder minimum was irrelevant to the climate, then why was there a 'little ice age'?\n\nAdmittedly, it remains an open question how important the sun's activity is to the climate – after all, if a complex system like the earth's climate cannot be successfully modeled, this holds for the past as well as for the future. It is not possible to state apodictically that the Maunder minimum 'produced' the little ice age. Intuitively though, we tend to think that the sun is indeed an important factor. On a geological time scale, the last major ice age happened only a very short time ago, and we know that there have been vast variations in average temperatures over large time scales. In fact, it is only because we live in a  warming cycle on these large time scales (an 'inter-glacial period') that human civilization as we know it exists at all. Try to imagine feeding more than 7 billion people with the planet a full 8 to 10 degrees Celsius colder and with a large part of its landmass covered in ice.\n\nOf course that is certainly not an imminent problem, but looking at the regularity with which glacial and inter-glacial periods occur, it seems obvious that it will become a problem one day. We happen to think that even a 'mini ice age' could be quite a nuisance. It would definitely make life a lot more uncomfortable in the Northern hemisphere. Currently there is no certainty what precisely the main cause of ice ages is, but cycles related to the sun (specifically the Milankovitch cycles, which describe changes in earth's orbit around the sun) are undoubtedly playing a role.\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperatures plus CO2 and dust concentration in the atmosphere over the past 400,000 odd years via the Vostok ice core data (and yes, CO2 tends to follow temperature, it doesn't lead; presumably there are feedback loops at work though, with higher CO2 concentration and temperature reinforcing each other during the up and downswings)- click to enlarge.\n\nWhat is slightly worrisome about the above chart is that the very cold periods tend to have a much longer duration than the warm periods, which seem to have a tendency to produce short-lived spike highs.

However, we are not yet at the point where the models are rejected or the greenhouse gas-centric AGW theory is truly abandoned. Instead we're now in the 'how can we keep saying we are right while we're obviously wrong' phase. A lot is at stake after all: scientific reputations, but most importantly, a lot of money.\n\nPolicymakers don't want to hear that there is no problem, because that would close off a major source of tax revenues as well as what is currently a major avenue for crony capitalism and pork barrel spending through the subsidization of uneconomic 'green energy' schemes. Entire vast bureaucracies depend on AGW as well, and there is no alternative promotion in sight yet that could replace this sheer inexhaustible and vast fount of tax payer funded non-activity. So now the hope is that the heat is 'hiding out' deep in the oceans and ready to return at the drop of a hat (or rather, a turn of the trade winds). That may however not happen.

abstract humans and other animals express power through open expansive postures and they express powerlessness through closed contractive postures but can these postures actually cause power the results of this study confirmed our prediction that posing in highpower nonverbal displays as opposed to lowpower nonverbal displays would cause neuroendocrine and behavioral changes for both male and female participants highpower posers experienced elevations in testosterone decreases in cortisol and increased feelings of power and tolerance for risk lowpower posers exhibited the opposite pattern in short posing in displays of power caused advantaged and adaptive psychological physiological and behavioral changes and these findings suggest that embodiment extends beyond mere thinking and feeling to physiology and subsequent behavioral choices that a person can by assuming two simple 1min poses embody power and instantly become more powerful has realworld actionable implications in the conclusion by simply changing physical posture an individual prepares his or her mental and physiological systems to endure difficult and stressful situations and perhaps to actually improve confidence and performance in situations such as interviewing for jobs speaking in public disagreeing with a boss or taking potentially profitable risks these findings suggest that in some situations

probably the beginning of the hiatus says kevin trenberth a climate scientist at the national center for atmospheric research ncar in boulder colorado according to this theory the tropical pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming yearseventually trenberth says it will switch back in the other direction stark contrast on a chart of global atmospheric temperatures the hiatus stands in stark contrast to the rapid warming of the two decades that preceded it simulations conducted in advance of the 2013–14 assessment from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc suggest that the warming should have continued at an average rate of 021 °c per decade from 1998 to 2012 instead the observed warming during that period was just 004 °c per decade as measured by the uk met office in exeter and the climatic research unit at the university of east anglia in norwich uk the simplest explanation for both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the models is natural variability much like the swings between warm and cold in daytoday weather chaotic climate fluctuations can knock global temperatures up or down from year to year and decade to decade records of past climate show some longlasting global heatwaves and cold snaps and climate models suggest that either of these can occur as the world warms under the influence of greenhouse gases nate mantuanoaa but none of the climate simulations carried out for the ipcc produced this particular hiatus at this particular time that has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared others say that this conclusion goes against the longterm temperature trends as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past and many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively shortterm blip in the climate if you are interested in global climate change your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years says susan solomon a climate scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge but even those scientists who remain confident in the underlying models acknowledge that there is increasing pressure to work out just what is happening today a few years ago you saw the

laboratory in princeton new jersey now its something to explain researchers have followed various leads in recent years focusing mainly on a trio of factors the sun 1 atmospheric aerosol particles 2

            "text": "The biggest mystery in climate science today may have begun, unbeknownst to anybody at the time, with a subtle weakening of the tropical trade winds blowing across the Pacific Ocean in late 1997. These winds normally push sun-baked water towards Indonesia. When they slackened, the warm water sloshed back towards South America, resulting in a spectacular example of a phenomenon known as El Niño. Average global temperatures hit a record high in 1998 — and then the warming stalled.\n\nFor several years, scientists wrote off the stall as noise in the climate system: the natural variations in the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere that drive warm or cool spells around the globe. But the pause has persisted, sparking a minor crisis of confidence in the field. Although there have been jumps and dips, average atmospheric temperatures have risen little since 1998, in seeming defiance of projections of climate models and the ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. Climate sceptics have seized on the temperature trends as evidence that global warming has ground to a halt. Climate scientists, meanwhile, know that heat must still be building up somewhere in the climate system, but they have struggled to explain where it is going, if not into the atmosphere. Some have begun to wonder whether there is something amiss in their models.\n\nNow, as the global-warming hiatus enters its sixteenth year, scientists are at last making headway in the case of the missing heat. Some have pointed to the Sun, volcanoes and even pollution from China as potential culprits, but recent studies suggest that the oceans are key to explaining the anomaly. The latest suspect is the El Niño of 1997–98, which pumped prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere — perhaps enough to tip the equatorial Pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since.\n\n“The 1997 to ’98 El Niño event was a trigger for the changes in the Pacific, and I think that’s very probably the beginning of the hiatus,” says Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. According to this theory, the tropical Pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming years.“Eventually,” Trenberth says, “it will switch back in the other direction.”\n\nOn a chart of global atmospheric temperatures, the hiatus stands in stark contrast to the rapid warming of the two decades that preceded it. Simulations conducted in advance of the 2013–14 assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that the warming should have continued at an average rate of 0.21 °C per decade from 1998 to 2012. Instead, the observed warming during that period was just 0.04 °C per decade, as measured by the UK Met Office in Exeter and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK.\n\nThe simplest explanation for both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the models is natural variability. Much like the swings between warm and cold in day-to-day weather, chaotic climate fluctuations can knock global temperatures up or down from year to year and decade to decade. Records of past climate show some long-lasting global heatwaves and cold snaps, and climate models suggest that either of these can occur as the world warms under the influence of greenhouse gases.\n\nBut none of the climate simulations carried out for the IPCC produced this particular hiatus at this particular time. That has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases, and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared. Others say that this conclusion goes against the long-term temperature trends, as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past. And many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively short-term blip in the climate. “If you are interested in global climate change, your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years,” says Susan Solomon, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.\n\nBut even those scientists who remain confident in the underlying models acknowledge that there is increasing pressure to work out just what is happening today. “A few years ago you saw the hiatus, but it could be dismissed because it was well within the noise,” says Gabriel Vecchi, a climate scientist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. “Now it’s something to explain.”\n\nResearchers have followed various leads in recent years, focusing mainly on a trio of factors: the Sun1, atmospheric aerosol particles2 and the oceans3. The output of energy from the Sun tends to wax and wane on an 11-year cycle, but the Sun entered a prolonged lull around the turn of the millennium. The natural 11-year cycle is currently approaching its peak, but thus far it has been the weakest solar maximum in a century. This could help to explain both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the model simulations, which include a higher solar output than Earth has experienced since 2000.\n\nAn unexpected increase in the number of stratospheric aerosol particles could be another factor keeping Earth cooler than predicted. These particles reflect sunlight back into space, and scientists suspect that small volcanoes — and perhaps even industrialization in China — could have pumped extra aerosols into the stratosphere during the past 16 years, depressing global temperatures.\n\nSome have argued that these two factors could be primary drivers of the hiatus, but studies published in the past few years suggest that their effects are likely to be relatively small4, 5. Trenberth, for example, analysed their impacts on the basis of satellite measurements of energy entering and exiting the planet, and estimated that aerosols and solar activity account for just 20% of the hiatus. That leaves the bulk of the hiatus to the oceans, which serve as giant sponges for heat. And here, the spotlight falls on the equatorial Pacific.\n\nJust before the hiatus took hold, that region had turned unusually warm during the El Niño of 1997–98, which fuelled extreme weather across the planet, from floods in Chile and California to droughts and wildfires in Mexico and Indonesia. But it ended just as quickly as it had begun, and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of El Niño’s sister effect, La Niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial Pacific with a vengeance. More importantly, the entire eastern Pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day.\n\nThis variation in ocean temperature, known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), may be a crucial piece of the hiatus puzzle. The cycle reverses every 15–30 years, and in its positive phase, the oscillation favours El Niño, which tends to warm the atmosphere (see ‘The fickle ocean’). After a couple of decades of releasing heat from the eastern and central Pacific, the region cools and enters the negative phase of the PDO. This state tends towards La Niña, which brings cool waters up from the depths along the Equator and tends to cool the planet. Researchers identified the PDO pattern in 1997, but have only recently begun to understand how it fits in with broader ocean-circulation patterns and how it may help to explain the hiatus.\n\nOne important finding came in 2011, when a team of researchers at NCAR led by Gerald Meehl reported that inserting a PDO pattern into global climate models causes decade-scale breaks in global warming3. Ocean-temperature data from the recent hiatus reveal why: in a subsequent study, the NCAR researchers showed that more heat moved into the deep ocean after 1998, which helped to prevent the atmosphere from warming6. In a third paper, the group used computer models to document the flip side of the process: when the PDO switches to its positive phase, it heats up the surface ocean and atmosphere, helping to drive decades of rapid warming7.\n\nA key breakthrough came last year from Shang-Ping Xie and Yu Kosaka at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. The duo took a different tack, by programming a model with actual sea surface temperatures from recent decades in the eastern equatorial Pacific, and then seeing what happened to the rest of the globe8. Their model not only recreated the hiatus in global temperatures, but also reproduced some of the seasonal and regional climate trends that have marked the hiatus, including warming in many areas and cooler northern winters.\n\n“It was actually a revelation for me when I saw that paper,” says John Fyfe, a climate modeller at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis in Victoria. But it did not, he adds, explain everything. “What it skirted was the question of what is driving the tropical cooling.”\n\nThat was investigated by Trenberth and John Fasullo, also at NCAR, who brought in winds and ocean data to explain how the pattern emerges4. Their study documents how tropical trade winds associated with La Niña conditions help to drive warm water westward and, ultimately, deep into the ocean, while promoting the upwelling of cool waters along the eastern equatorial region. In extreme cases, such as the La Niña of 1998, this may be able to push the ocean into a cool phase of the PDO. An analysis of historical data buttressed these conclusions, showing that the cool phase of the PDO coincided with a few decades of cooler temperatures after the Second World War (see ‘The Pacific’s global reach’), and that the warm phase lined up with the sharp spike seen in global temperatures between 1976 and 1998 (ref. 4).\n\n“I believe the evidence is pretty clear,” says Mark Cane, a climatologist at Columbia University in New York. “It’s not about aerosols or stratospheric water vapour; it’s about having had a decade of cooler temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific.”\n\nCane was the first to predict the current cooling in the Pacific, although the implications weren’t clear at the time. In 2004, he and his colleagues found that a simple regional climate model predicted a warm shift in the Pacific that began around 1976, when global temperatures began to rise sharply9. Almost as an afterthought, they concluded their paper with a simple forecast: “For what it is worth the model predicts that the 1998 El Niño ended the post-1976 tropical Pacific warm period.”\n\nIt is an eerily accurate result, but the work remains hotly contested, in part because it is based on a partial climate model that focuses on the equatorial Pacific alone. Cane further maintains that the trend over the past century has been towards warmer temperatures in the western Pacific relative to those in the east. That opens the door, he says, to the possibility that warming from greenhouse gases is driving La Niña-like conditions and could continue to do so in the future, helping to suppress global warming. “If all of that is true, it’s a negative feedback, and if we don’t capture it in our models they will overstate the warming,” he says.\n\nThere are two potential holes in his assessment. First, the historical ocean-temperature data are notoriously imprecise, leading many researchers to dispute Cane’s assertion that the equatorial Pacific shifted towards a more La Niña-like state during the past century10. Second, many researchers have found the opposite pattern in simulations with full climate models, which factor in the suite of atmospheric and oceanic interactions beyond the equatorial Pacific. These tend to reveal a trend towards more El Niño-like conditions as a result of global warming. The difference seems to lie, in part, in how warming influences evaporation in areas of the Pacific, according to Trenberth. He says the models suggest that global warming has a greater impact on temperatures in the relatively cool east, because the increase in evaporation adds water vapour to the atmosphere there and enhances atmospheric warming; this effect is weaker in the warmer western Pacific, where the air is already saturated with moisture.\n\nScientists may get to test their theories soon enough. At present, strong tropical trade winds are pushing ever more warm water westward towards Indonesia, fuelling storms such as November’s Typhoon Haiyan, and nudging up sea levels in the western Pacific; they are now roughly 20 centimetres higher than those in the eastern Pacific. Sooner or later, the trend will inevitably reverse. “You can’t keep piling up warm water in the western Pacific,” Trenberth says. “At some point, the water will get so high that it just sloshes back.” And when that happens, if scientists are on the right track, the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again.",

Simulations conducted in advance of the 2013–14 assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that the warming should have continued at an average rate of 0.21 °C per decade from 1998 to 2012. Instead, the observed warming during that period was just 0.04 °C per decade, as measured by the UK Met Office in Exeter and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK.\n\nThe simplest explanation for both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the models is natural variability. Much like the swings between warm and cold in day-to-day weather, chaotic climate fluctuations can knock global temperatures up or down from year to year and decade to decade. Records of past climate show some long-lasting global heatwaves and cold snaps, and climate models suggest that either of these can occur as the world warms under the influence of greenhouse gases.\n\nBut none of the climate simulations carried out for the IPCC produced this particular hiatus at this particular time. That has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases, and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared. Others say that this conclusion goes against the long-term temperature trends, as well as palaeoclimate data that are used to extend the temperature record far into the past. And many researchers caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively short-term blip in the climate. “If you are interested in global climate change, your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years,” says Susan Solomon, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.\n\nBut even those scientists who remain confident in the underlying models acknowledge that there is increasing pressure to work out just what is happening today. “A few years ago you saw the hiatus, but it could be dismissed because it was well within the noise,” says Gabriel Vecchi, a climate scientist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. “Now it’s something to explain.”\n\nResearchers have followed various leads in recent years, focusing mainly on a trio of factors: the Sun1, atmospheric aerosol particles2 and the oceans3. The output of energy from the Sun tends to wax and wane on an 11-year cycle, but the Sun entered a prolonged lull around the turn of the millennium. The natural 11-year cycle is currently approaching its peak, but thus far it has been the weakest solar maximum in a century. This could help to explain both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the model simulations, which include a higher solar output than Earth has experienced since 2000.\n\nAn unexpected increase in the number of stratospheric aerosol particles could be another factor keeping Earth cooler than predicted. These particles reflect sunlight back into space, and scientists suspect that small volcanoes — and perhaps even industrialization in China — could have pumped extra aerosols into the stratosphere during the past 16 years, depressing global temperatures.\n\nSome have argued that these two factors could be primary drivers of the hiatus, but studies published in the past few years suggest that their effects are likely to be relatively small4, 5. Trenberth, for example, analysed their impacts on the basis of satellite measurements of energy entering and exiting the planet, and estimated that aerosols and solar activity account for just 20% of the hiatus. That leaves the bulk of the hiatus to the oceans, which serve as giant sponges for heat. And here, the spotlight falls on the equatorial Pacific.\n\nJust before the hiatus took hold, that region had turned unusually warm during the El Niño of 1997–98, which fuelled extreme weather across the planet, from floods in Chile and California to droughts and wildfires in Mexico and Indonesia. But it ended just as quickly as it had begun, and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of El Niño’s sister effect, La Niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial Pacific with a vengeance. More importantly, the entire eastern Pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day.\n\nThis variation in ocean temperature, known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), may be a crucial piece of the hiatus puzzle. The cycle reverses every 15–30 years, and in its positive phase, the oscillation favours El Niño, which tends to warm the atmosphere (see ‘The fickle ocean’). After a couple of decades of releasing heat from the eastern and central Pacific, the region cools and enters the negative phase of the PDO. This state tends towards La Niña, which brings cool waters up from the depths along the Equator and tends to cool the planet. Researchers identified the PDO pattern in 1997, but have only recently begun to understand how it fits in with broader ocean-circulation patterns and how it may help to explain the hiatus.\n\nOne important finding came in 2011, when a team of researchers at NCAR led by Gerald Meehl reported that inserting a PDO pattern into global climate models causes decade-scale breaks in global warming3. Ocean-temperature data from the recent hiatus reveal why: in a subsequent study, the NCAR researchers showed that more heat moved into the deep ocean after 1998, which helped to prevent the atmosphere from warming6. In a third paper, the group used computer models to document the flip side of the process: when the PDO switches to its positive phase, it heats up the surface ocean and atmosphere, helping to drive decades of rapid warming7.\n\nA key breakthrough came last year from Shang-Ping Xie and Yu Kosaka at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. The duo took a different tack, by programming a model with actual sea surface temperatures from recent decades in the eastern equatorial Pacific, and then seeing what happened to the rest of the globe8. Their model not only recreated the hiatus in global temperatures, but also reproduced some of the seasonal and regional climate trends that have marked the hiatus, including warming in many areas and cooler northern winters.\n\n“It was actually a revelation for me when I saw that paper,” says John Fyfe, a climate modeller at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis in Victoria. But it did not, he adds, explain everything. “What it skirted was the question of what is driving the tropical cooling.”\n\nThat was investigated by Trenberth and John Fasullo, also at NCAR, who brought in winds and ocean data to explain how the pattern emerges4. Their study documents how tropical trade winds associated with La Niña conditions help to drive warm water westward and, ultimately, deep into the ocean, while promoting the upwelling of cool waters along the eastern equatorial region. In extreme cases, such as the La Niña of 1998, this may be able to push the ocean into a cool phase of the PDO. An analysis of historical data buttressed these conclusions, showing that the cool phase of the PDO coincided with a few decades of cooler temperatures after the Second World War (see ‘The Pacific’s global reach’), and that the warm phase lined up with the sharp spike seen in global temperatures between 1976 and 1998 (ref. 4).\n\n“I believe the evidence is pretty clear,” says Mark Cane, a climatologist at Columbia University in New York. “It’s not about aerosols or stratospheric water vapour; it’s about having had a decade of cooler temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific.”\n\nCane was the first to predict the current cooling in the Pacific, although the implications weren’t clear at the time. In 2004, he and his colleagues found that a simple regional climate model predicted a warm shift in the Pacific that began around 1976, when global temperatures began to rise sharply9. Almost as an afterthought, they concluded their paper with a simple forecast: “For what it is worth the model predicts that the 1998 El Niño ended the post-1976 tropical Pacific warm period.”\n\nIt is an eerily accurate result, but the work remains hotly contested, in part because it is based on a partial climate model that focuses on the equatorial Pacific alone. Cane further maintains that the trend over the past century has been towards warmer temperatures in the western Pacific relative to those in the east. That opens the door, he says, to the possibility that warming from greenhouse gases is driving La Niña-like conditions and could continue to do so in the future, helping to suppress global warming. “If all of that is true, it’s a negative feedback, and if we don’t capture it in our models they will overstate the warming,” he says.\n\nThere are two potential holes in his assessment. First, the historical ocean-temperature data are notoriously imprecise, leading many researchers to dispute Cane’s assertion that the equatorial Pacific shifted towards a more La Niña-like state during the past century10. Second, many researchers have found the opposite pattern in simulations with full climate models, which factor in the suite of atmospheric and oceanic interactions beyond the equatorial Pacific. These tend to reveal a trend towards more El Niño-like conditions as a result of global warming. The difference seems to lie, in part, in how warming influences evaporation in areas of the Pacific, according to Trenberth. He says the models suggest that global warming has a greater impact on temperatures in the relatively cool east, because the increase in evaporation adds water vapour to the atmosphere there and enhances atmospheric warming; this effect is weaker in the warmer western Pacific, where the air is already saturated with moisture.\n\nScientists may get to test their theories soon enough. At present, strong tropical trade winds are pushing ever more warm water westward towards Indonesia, fuelling storms such as November’s Typhoon Haiyan, and nudging up sea levels in the western Pacific; they are now roughly 20 centimetres higher than those in the eastern Pacific. Sooner or later, the trend will inevitably reverse. “You can’t keep piling up warm water in the western Pacific,” Trenberth says. “At some point, the water will get so high that it just sloshes back.” And when that happens, if scientists are on the right track, the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again.",

sentence as if to prove that the warmist lobby is actually openminded about climate change nothing could be further from the truth that pack of public purse parasites are nothing if not persistent the latest idea floated is that the el niño of 1997–98 tipped the equatorial pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since this was preceded by the pumping of prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere a trend now reversed the pacific cycles between warm el niño and cold la niña phases the 1997 to 98 el niño event was a trigger

has been getting colder and could get colder still but eventually it will get warmer its the bloody climate its always getting colder or warmer in cycles that operate over years decades centuries

fluctuations can send global temperatures up or down from year to year and even decade to decade supposedly climate models suggest that longlasting global heatwaves and cold snaps can occur as the

other words climate theory at least when it comes to sensitivity to atmospheric co 2 levels could be wrong that is how science works theories are proposed then they are tested by comparison to the

they made decades ago not so long ago warmist climate types were saying you needed ten or fifteen years to establish a real trend many researchers still caution against evaluating models on the basis

at the massachusetts institute of technology the timeframe changes but the song remains the same according to judith curry a professor at georgia institute of technologys school of earth and atmospheric sciences solomon should have stated that if you are interested in the climate response to a longterm secular buildup of greenhouse gases then your main focus should be timescales of 50100 years i agree with this and if you look at the last 100 years you have that other inconvenient pause to explain 19401975 the pacific cycles have been controlling shortterm climate change for decades in their near panic some climatologists are looking to the suns changing output for an explanation energy received from the sun tends to wax and wane on an 11year cycle but some researchers suggest that longer term variability in our stars output could explain things like the medieval warm period or the little ice age perhaps even the recent modest warming trend even when new mechanisms that amplify the suns natural variability were discovered the linkage between climate change and the suns output was poopooed by the climate change establishment indeed the sun entered a prolonged lull around the turn of the millennium the natural 11year cycle has again passed its peak and the recent solar maximum proved to be the weakest in a century this could help to explain both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the model simulations which include a higher solar output than earth has experienced since 2000 writes tollefson but no that would be too logical too easy besides we have the culprit that daemon carbon dioxide the missing global warming must be here somewhere frantic warmists have turned to the ocean the equatorial pacific in particular in the hunt for the missing heat just before the hiatus took hold that region had turned unusually warm during the el niño of 1997–98 which fuelled extreme weather across the planet from floods in chile and california to droughts and wildfires in mexico and indonesia but it ended just as quickly as it had begun and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of el niños sister effect la niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial pacific with a vengeance more importantly the entire eastern pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day others have jumped on the el niñola niña bandwagon including shangping xie and yu kosaka from the scripps institution of oceanography typical of modern climatologists they turned to modeling by driving a model with actual sea surface temperatures from recent decades their model reportedly recreated the pause in global temperature rise and even reproduced some of the seasonal and regional climate trends occurring during the hiatus comparison of predicted

sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the equatorial eastern pacific 82 of the earths surface follow observed measurements while their result is certainly an improvement over other modeling attempts it is really not a surprise that when you force a model with the observed temperature over time you end up getting output that closely follows the real temperatures there is an old saying if you torture the data long enough it will tell you what you want to hear computer models simply automate the process of data abuse more impressive mark cane a climatologist at columbia university was the first to predict the current cooling in the pacific back in 2004 although the implications werent clear at the time i believe the evidence is pretty clear he said its not about aerosols or stratospheric water vapor its about having had a decade of cooler temperatures in the eastern equatorial pacific but the models do not explain everything says john fyfe a climate modeler at the canadian centre for climate modelling and analysis commenting on the paper by xie and kosaka what it skirted was the question of what is driving the tropical cooling assuming the mechanism behind the climate oscillation is the shifting water temperatures in the pacific could this mean that the vaunted temperature rise that drove the global warming debate during the 80s and 90s was caused by the ocean dumping heat it had already stored up as part of a natural cycle once the heat was released into the atmosphere it was eventually radiated back into space during a period of relatively high solar activity in the meantime the ocean is now doing the reverse cooling the atmosphere reinforcing the cooling trend scientists report the suns activity is at its lowest for 100 years some are even warning of a new maunder minimum and an accompanying plunge in global temperatures the recent solar maximum was the weakest in 100 years has the sun gone to sleep are we about to swing from global warming to a new ice age nobody really knows and if they say they do they are lying human climate science is still a crude inexact practice and its practitioners are a lot less knowledgeable than they let on yet the dire warnings continue to flow from the warmist camp accompanied by demands for more funding for research in reality the current climate change debate is nothing more than special interest politics competing in the news media for fame and public funding nassim taleb and constantine sandis published a paper expounding what they termed the skin in the game heuristic though aimed primarily at the field of statistics the authors posit that anyone making claims or predictions that could profit themselves while bringing harm to others should be held responsible for their actions we propose a global and morally mandatory heuristic that anyone involved in an action which can possibly generate harm for others even probabilistically should be required to be exposed to some damage regardless of context therein lies the problem with global warming research—the predicted damage occurs far in the future beyond the lifetimes of the scientists yammering on about climate catastrophes

            "text": "Procrastinating About The Pause Submitted by Doug L. Hoffman on Tue, 01/21/2014 - 13:27 The world is entering the 16 th year of the greatest climate science embarrassment in modern history—the pause in global warming. Despite rising IPCC confidence levels and hundreds of computer model predictions, that darned old climate is just not behaving like the boffins say it should. After all, CO 2 keeps rising, and we all know that CO 2 drives Earth's climate like the thermostat in a house... or not. No longer able to sweep the lack of warming under the observational rug, the climate change community had started flailing about for answers: the heat must be hiding deep in the ocean, it must be soot from China, some have even begun to wonder whether there is something wrong with their models. Most are still convinced that the missing heat is hidden somewhere because they will not accept the simplest explanation—the theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming is fundamentally incorrect. In a year that has seen a boat full of intrepid tree-huggers get stuck in the Antarctic summer ice and North America pummeled by Arctic fronts, the likes of which not experience for decades, it is difficult to convince the average Earthling that the ecosphere is in deadly danger from global warming. Just as the warming climate of the last three decades of the 20 th Century helped make the climate alarmists' claims seem more plausible, the Pause has made the global warming catastrophists look like a bunch of over educated Chicken Littles. Finally having to admit that the pause is not just a yearly fluctuation, the forces of AGW are trying to mount a counter attack. Their offensive has begun with a piece in the journal Nature: For several years, scientists wrote off the stall as noise in the climate system: the natural variations in the atmosphere, oceans and biosphere that drive warm or cool spells around the globe. But the pause has persisted, sparking a minor crisis of confidence in the field. Although there have been jumps and dips, average atmospheric temperatures have risen little since 1998, in seeming defiance of projections of climate models and the ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. Climate sceptics have seized on the temperature trends as evidence that global warming has ground to a halt. Climate scientists, meanwhile, know that heat must still be building up somewhere in the climate system, but they have struggled to explain where it is going, if not into the atmosphere. Some have begun to wonder whether there is something amiss in their models. Notice the modest room for doubt inserted in the last sentence, as if to prove that the warmist lobby is actually open-minded about climate change. Nothing could be further from the truth. That pack of public purse parasites are nothing if not persistent. The latest idea floated is that the El Niño of 1997–98 tipped the equatorial Pacific into a prolonged cold state that has suppressed global temperatures ever since. This was preceded by the pumping of prodigious quantities of heat out of the oceans and into the atmosphere, a trend now reversed. \n\n The Pacific cycles between warm, El Niño, and cold, La Niña, phases. “The 1997 to ’98 El Niño event was a trigger for the changes in the Pacific, and I think that’s very probably the beginning of the hiatus,” says Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. According to this theory, the tropical Pacific should snap out of its prolonged cold spell in the coming years.“Eventually,” Trenberth says, “it will switch back in the other direction.” Brilliant. It has been getting colder and could get colder still, but eventually it will get warmer. It's the bloody climate! It's always getting colder or warmer, in cycles that operate over years, decades, centuries, millennia, and even millions of years. The unvoiced truth here is that all of the climate model based simulations that were held up as “proof” that the climate was going awry were wrong. All of them. Simulations conducted in advance of the 2013–14 assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that the warming should have continued at an average rate of 0.21°C per decade from 1998 to 2012. Instead, the observed warming during that period was just 0.04°C per decade, as measured by the UK Met Office in Exeter and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK. According to Jeff Tollefson, a science writer at Nature, the simplest explanation for both the pause and the model prediction discrepancies is natural variability. Chaotic climate fluctuations can send global temperatures up or down from year to year and even decade to decade. Supposedly, climate models suggest that long-lasting global heatwaves and cold snaps can occur as the world warms under the influence of greenhouse gases. “But none of the climate simulations carried out for the IPCC produced this particular hiatus at this particular time,” Tollefson opines. “That has led sceptics — and some scientists — to the controversial conclusion that the models might be overestimating the effect of greenhouse gases, and that future warming might not be as strong as is feared.” In other words, climate theory, at least when it comes to sensitivity to atmospheric CO 2 levels, could be wrong. That is how science works: theories are proposed; then they are tested by comparison to the real world; if they are proven wrong or found wanting they are replaced by new theories. Repeat as necessary. Why has it proven so difficult for climate scientists to back away from the outrageous claims they made decades ago? Not so long ago, warmist climate types were saying you needed ten or fifteen years to establish a real trend. Many researchers still caution against evaluating models on the basis of a relatively short-term blip in the climate, but the “If you are interested in global climate change, your main focus ought to be on timescales of 50 to 100 years,” says Susan Solomon, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The time-frame changes but the song remains the same. According to Judith Curry, a professor at Georgia Institute of Technology's School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences: “Solomon should have stated that if you are interested in the climate response to a long-term secular buildup of greenhouse gases, then your main focus should be timescales of 50-100 years.  I agree with this.  And if you look at the last 100 years, you have that other inconvenient pause to explain: 1940-1975.” \n\n The Pacific cycles have been controlling short-term climate change for decades. In their near panic, some climatologists are looking to the Sun's changing output for an explanation. Energy received from the Sun tends to wax and wane on an 11-year cycle, but some researchers suggest that longer term variability in our star's output could explain things like the Medieval Warm Period or the Little Ice Age, perhaps even the recent modest warming trend. Even when new mechanisms that amplify the Sun's natural variability were discovered, the linkage between climate change and the Sun's output was poo-pooed by the climate change establishment. Indeed, the Sun entered a prolonged lull around the turn of the millennium. The natural 11-year cycle has again passed its peak, and the recent solar maximum proved to be the weakest in a century. “This could help to explain both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the model simulations, which include a higher solar output than Earth has experienced since 2000,” writes Tollefson. But no, that would be too logical, too easy. Besides we have the culprit, that daemon carbon dioxide. The missing global warming must be here somewhere. Frantic warmists have turned to the Ocean, the equatorial Pacific in particular, in the hunt for the missing heat: Just before the hiatus took hold, that region had turned unusually warm during the El Niño of 1997–98, which fuelled extreme weather across the planet, from floods in Chile and California to droughts and wildfires in Mexico and Indonesia. But it ended just as quickly as it had begun, and by late 1998 cold waters — a mark of El Niño’s sister effect, La Niña — had returned to the eastern equatorial Pacific with a vengeance. More importantly, the entire eastern Pacific flipped into a cool state that has continued more or less to this day. Others have jumped on the El Niño/La Niña bandwagon, including Shang-Ping Xie and Yu Kosaka from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Typical of modern climatologists, they turned to modeling. By driving a model with actual sea surface temperatures from recent decades, their model reportedly recreated the pause in global temperature rise, and even reproduced some of the seasonal and regional climate trends occurring during the hiatus. \n\n Comparison of predicted and actual temperatures. In the historical (HIST) experiment the model is forced with observed atmospheric composition changes and the solar cycle. In the Pacific Ocean–Global Atmosphere (POGA) experiments, sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the equatorial eastern Pacific (8.2% of the Earth’s surface) follow observed measurements. While their result is certainly an improvement over other modeling attempts it is really not a surprise that, when you force a model with the observed temperature over time, you end up getting output that closely follows the real temperatures. There is an old saying: “If you torture the data long enough it will tell you what you want to hear.” Computer models simply automate the process of data abuse. More impressive, Mark Cane, a climatologist at Columbia University, was the first to predict the current cooling in the Pacific back in 2004, although the implications weren’t clear at the time. “I believe the evidence is pretty clear,” he said. “It’s not about aerosols or stratospheric water vapor; it’s about having had a decade of cooler temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific.” But the models do not explain everything says John Fyfe, a climate modeler at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, commenting on the paper by Xie and Kosaka. “What it skirted was the question of what is driving the tropical cooling.” Assuming the mechanism behind the climate oscillation is the shifting water temperatures in the Pacific, could this mean that the vaunted temperature rise that drove the global warming debate during the 80s and 90s was caused by the ocean dumping heat it had already stored up as part of a natural cycle? Once the heat was released into the atmosphere it was eventually radiated back into space during a period of relatively high solar activity. In the meantime, the ocean is now doing the reverse, cooling the atmosphere. Reinforcing the cooling trend, scientists report the Sun's activity is at its lowest for 100 years. Some are even warning of a new “Maunder Minimum” and an accompanying plunge in global temperatures. \n\n The recent solar maximum was the weakest in 100 years. Has the Sun gone to sleep? Are we about to swing from global warming to a new Ice Age? Nobody really knows (and if they say they do they are lying). Human climate science is still a crude, inexact practice and its practitioners are a lot less knowledgeable than they let on. Yet the dire warnings continue to flow from the warmist camp, accompanied by demands for more funding for “research.” In reality, the current climate change debate is nothing more than special interest politics competing in the news media for fame and public funding. Nassim Taleb and Constantine Sandis published a paper expounding what they termed the “Skin In The Game Heuristic.” Though aimed primarily at the field of statistics, the author's posit that anyone making claims or predictions that could profit themselves while bringing harm to others should be held responsible for their actions: “We propose a global and morally mandatory heuristic that anyone involved in an action which can possibly generate harm for others, even probabilistically, should be required to be exposed to some damage, regardless of context.” Therein lies the problem with global warming research—the predicted damage occurs far in the future, beyond the lifetimes of the scientists yammering on about climate catastrophes on the horizon. If the predictions do not come true, there will still be immense damage of an economic nature—ruined industries and ruined lives because of irrational fear spread by people all long retired and mostly long dead. With little threat of contradiction, the inertia of group think—the much ballyhooed consensus—holds fast. John Tooby captured the essence of scientific consensus: “Because intellectuals are densely networked in self-selecting groups whose members' prestige is linked, we incubate endless, self-serving elite superstitions, with baleful effects.” On the other hand, for climate researchers the global warming panic has been a goldmine. Government funds have been showered on researchers at universities and government agencies in an effort to cover politicians' posteriors. For climate scientists the profits are in the present and the risk of being wrong far in the uncertain future. In short, they have no skin in the game, nothing to lose and everything to gain by pandering to the green lobby and other climate cranks. Skeptics like myself have been branded “climate criminals” by the more thuggish wing of the environmental movement, and some dissenting scientists have received death threats. I say we should level the playing field. All those blithely predicting climate doom should be held accountable for their half-assed predictions. Those whose models were used to bolster the outrageous claims made by the IPCC and their ilk should be defunded at the least and their respective financial sources should demand their money back. I am not saying researchers should not be building models or even publishing their results, but when they take the leap from incomplete, hypothetical models to claiming the end is nigh they should be held financially responsible. As long as there is no prospect of punishment for those who shout “catastrophic global warming” in a crowded planet, the farce that is AGW will continue. Be safe, enjoy the interglacial and stay skeptical.",

ultraviolet light as a result of this research we now know that corals from this area have great potential for reconstructing even longerterm historical evolution of the pacific decadal oscillation coauthor professor john pandolfi from uqs school of biological sciences said some bommies are five to six metres tall and 400 years old they can provide us with much longerterm information than is available from satellitebased data which goes back only 4050 years this will help refine future models for predicting this important climate phenomenon researchers from nioz royal netherlands

            "text": "It seems that a number of people are talking about a recent Nature News Feature that discusses missing heat, or why surface temperatures have risen slowly for the last 16 years or so.\n\nAn explanation for the supposed “hiatus” that is discussed in this news feature is that the rate of surface warming depends on the phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PDO is a cycle that lasts a few decades, during which the Pacific will go through a phase of being warmer than normal, followed by a phase when it’s cooler than normal – illustrated in the figure below (taken from the Nature News Feature).\n\n \n\n When the PDO phase is such that the Pacific is warmer than average, the surface temperatures rise quite quickly. When in the cool phase, the surface temperatures rise more slowly, or stall. This is shown below (taken from the Nature News Feature) and illustrates that the warm or cool phases could last for 20 – 30 years. The current slowdown/pause started about 16 years ago, and so some are suggesting that it could continue for another 10 – 15 years (maybe until 2030).\n\n \n\n There is, however, an issue with the current slowdown persisting for as long as another 15 years. The figure below is from Hansen et al. 2011 and shows surface temperatures and planetary energy imbalances for three different models. If, as the figure above illustrates, there was a surface warming pause between 1945 and 1975, then the figure below indicates that the planetary energy imbalance increased – during that period – from around 0.1 Wm-2 to about 0.4 – 0.5 Wm-2. This is actually consistent with what one would expect based on the increase in atmospheric CO 2 over that period.\n\n\n\nSo, is it possible that the current slowdown/pause could persist until 2030? Well, the energy imbalance in 1998 was probably around 0.6 Wm. If we follow a BAU emission scenario, atmospheric COcould increase to around 450ppm by 2030. Using Δ= 5.35 ln (C/C) would suggest that anthropogenic forcings would increase by about 1 Wmif a surface temperature standstill also persisted until 2030. So, we’d have an energy imbalance of between 1.5 and 2 Wmand the oceans would be absorbing significantly more energy than they are today. I guess it’s possible, but it seems somewhat unlikely. The oceans would need to absorb an ever increasing fraction of the excess energy.\n\nSo, the basic idea seems plausible, but even from the article itself it appears that it’s not accepted by all. However, it would seem unlikely that one could maintain the current conditions for much longer unless the planet is able to have a significantly higher energy imbalance than today without driving faster surface warming. I’ve written this quite quickly, so there’s probably much more that could be said and there may be some things I’ve missed, or mis-interpreted. The article itself, however, ends with\n\nAt present, strong tropical trade winds are pushing ever more warm water westward towards Indonesia, fuelling storms such as November’s Typhoon Haiyan, and nudging up sea levels in the western Pacific; they are now roughly 20 centimetres higher than those in the eastern Pacific. Sooner or later, the trend will inevitably reverse. “You can’t keep piling up warm water in the western Pacific,” Trenberth says. “At some point, the water will get so high that it just sloshes back.” And when that happens, if scientists are on the right track, the missing heat will reappear and temperatures will spike once again.",

This could help to explain both the hiatus and the discrepancy in the model simulations, which include a higher solar output than Earth has experienced since 2000.",

In extreme cases, such as the La Niña of 1998, this may be able to push the ocean into a cool phase of the PDO. An analysis of historical data buttressed these conclusions, showing that the cool phase of the PDO coincided with a few decades of cooler temperatures after the Second World War (see ‘The Pacific’s global reach’), and that the warm phase lined up with the sharp spike seen in global temperatures between 1976 and 1998 (ref. 4).",
